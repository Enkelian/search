Wolf's Lair Abyss
Wolf's Lair Abyss is an EP by the Norwegian black metal band Mayhem. According to the band's website, it is the first part of Grand Declaration of War. The main riff of the last track, "Symbols of Bloodswords", is used in "A Grand Declaration of War" and "View from Nihil (Part II)". This EP was the first release by Mayhem without Euronymous, who was killed in 1993. The new line-up's material was far more technical than that of earlier incarnations of the band; apart from the intro, each track contains at least two separate sections and is played at a furious tempo. Also, while Maniac's vocal contributions to the band are generally controversial, his performance on this EP is routinely praised. This EP has often been cited as the best item in the new line-up's discography. Track listing All tracks are written by Mayhem.
