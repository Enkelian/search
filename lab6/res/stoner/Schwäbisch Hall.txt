Schwäbisch Hall
Schwäbisch Hall (German pronunciation: [ˈʃvɛːbɪʃ ˈhal]; "Swabian Hall"), or Hall for short, is a town in the German state of Baden-Württemberg and capital of the district of Schwäbisch Hall. The town is located in the valley of the Kocher river in the north-eastern part of Baden-Württemberg. Hall was a Free Imperial City for five centuries until it was annexed by Württemberg in 1802. Etymology "Schwäbisch" refers to the Swabian League (German: Schwäbischer Bund). The origin of the second part of the name, "Hall", is unclear. It might be derived from a West Germanic word family that means "drying something by heating it", possibly referring to the open-pan salt making method used there until the saltworks closed down in 1925. History Early history Salt was produced from brine by the Celts at the site of Schwäbisch Hall as early as the fifth century BCE. The town was first mentioned in a document called Öhringer Stiftungsbrief dating from 1063. The village probably belonged first to the Counts of Comburg-Rothenburg and went from them to the Imperial house of Hohenstaufen (ca 1116). It was probably Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa who founded the imperial mint and started the coining of the so-called Heller. Hall
