Nicias (Greek: Νικίας) was an Indo-Greek king who ruled in the Paropamisade.

Time of reign Bopearachchi suggests that Nikias ruled c. 90–85 BCE. This late date is supported by the absence of Attic coins (see below). R. C. Senior on the other hand places him as a successor of Menander, c. 135–125 BCE, according to his interpretation of hoard findings. Regardless of which period is correct, the fact that Nicias ages visibly on his coins seems to indicate some longevity to his rule.

The third reverse is the type king on a prancing horse, as used by Antimachus II found on a single drachm.His bronzes feature Zeus/dolphin or portrait / king on prancing horse. Some varieties are crude with lunate sigmas and square
