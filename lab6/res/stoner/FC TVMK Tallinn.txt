FC TVMK is a defunct Estonian football club. TVMK won the Estonian Meistriliiga in 2005. They are also multiple winners of the Estonian Cup. History Name History TVMK (1951–1991) TVMV (1992) Tevalte-Marlekor (1995–1996) FC Marlekor (1996–1997) TVMK (1997–2008)Founded in 1951, TVMK played in regional leagues until 1986, when the club eneterd the "Jõgeva III division", winning promotion to the II liiga the same year. TVMK won the Estonian SSR title in 1990 and the league plus cup double the following year, the last title before Estonia regained its independence. The club was renamed TVMV Tallinn for the next season. The following year the club was acquired by the Nikol company and it is generally believed that the history of the original TVMK ended at that point. The newly created Nikol Tallinn served as a prototype for the creation of Lantana Tallinn two years later. Just to avoid any possible confusion, Nikol is usually viewed as a separate club. The future of TVMK and its history is generally linked with the acquisition of Tevalte Tallinn (formerly "Vigri") by the Marlekor company in 1995, the same company that privatized "Tallinn's furniture and plywood factory" (abbreviated simply as TVMK in Estonian) in 1993.
