Hydroiodic acid
Hydroiodic acid (or hydriodic acid) is a highly acidic aqueous solution of hydrogen iodide (HI) (concentrated solution usually 48 - 57% HI). It is the second strongest hydrohalic acid, after hydroastatic acid. Hydroiodic acid is a commonly used chemical reagent and is one of the strong acids that ionize completely in an aqueous solution. Reactions Hydroiodic acid readily reacts with oxygen in air, contributing to the deep colours associated with old samples; 4 HI + O2 → 2 H2O + 2 I2 HI + I2 → HI3Like other halogens, hydroiodic acid will perform addition reactions with unsaturated hydrocarbons such as alkenes. Cativa process The Cativa process is a major end use of hydroiodic acid, which serves as a co-catalyst for the production of acetic acid by the carbonylation of methanol. Illicit uses Hydroiodic acid is listed as a U.S. Federal DEA List I Chemical, owing to its use as a reducing agent related to the production of methamphetamine from pseudoephedrine (recovered from nasal decongestant pills).
