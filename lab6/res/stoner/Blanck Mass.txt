Blanck Mass
Blanck Mass is a British electronic solo project by Benjamin John Power, one of the founding members of drone band Fuck Buttons. Career His track "Sundowner" was used at key points during the Opening Ceremony of the 2012 Olympic games. It was first heard as the Union Flag was brought into the stadium by members of the Armed Forces. Later it was played when the Olympic Flag was paraded, and finally as the Olympic Flame was brought to the stadium in a speedboat. Blanck Mass opened for Icelandic band Sigur RÃ³s on their 2013 UK tour. In 2014, Power announced that he was close to finishing off a new Blanck Mass album, and supported Jon Hopkins at the Royal Festival Hall in September. Power released Dumb Flesh through Sacred Bones Records on 11 May 2015. The vinyl version included an exclusive track "Life Science (Ambient Suite)". Power supported the release with tours and dates in the UK, US, Europe and Australia and received critical acclaim for the album. Later in the year Power released The Great Confuso EP which featured a brand new three-part track as well as remixes of album tracks by Genesis P-Orridge, Dalhous and Konx-Om-Pax. A 12"
