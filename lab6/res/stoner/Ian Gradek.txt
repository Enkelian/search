Howlin' Rain is an American, San Francisco based band, which formed in 2004 and released their first album in 2006. Described as "classically soulful" Howlin' Rain are currently signed with Rick Rubin to the Columbia Records subset American Recordings. Subsequent releases by the band will be handled jointly between American Recordings and the indie label Birdman Records. The band's 2008 album Magnificent Fiend has been described as a "combination of psychedelia, blues, funk and classic 1970s arena rock." Their album, The Russian Wilds, was released in February 2012. History Ethan Miller, while still with Comets on Fire, felt the urge to pursue a more melodic sound in his music and express the influence of growing up on the Lost Coast, so he formed Howlin' Rain with his former high school band-mate Ian Gradek, and drummer John Moloney (who is now with the neo-folk ensemble Sunburned Hand of the Man). After the 2006 release of Comets on Fire's last album, he released Howlin' Rain's self-titled debut album on Birdman Records and began touring with Queens of the Stone Age.Shortly after the release of their first album, Moloney left the band. after which Garett Goddard (The Cuts), Eli Eckert and Joel Robinow
