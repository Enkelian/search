Soft Skull Press
Soft Skull Press is an independent book publisher founded by Sander Hicks in 1992, and run by Richard Eoin Nash from 2001 to 2009, and Denise Oswald from 2009 to 2010, and Yuka Igarashi since 2017. In 2007, Nash sold Soft Skull to Counterpoint LLC, who closed Soft Skull's New York operation in 2010. Counterpoint merged into fellow publisher Catapult in 2016; subsequently, Soft Skull reopened its New York office with Yuka Igarashi as editor-in-chief, and began to reissue backlist books, including The Amputee's Guide to Sex by Jillian Weise and Something Bright, Then Holes by Maggie Nelson and Wayne Koestenbaum's 2004 novel, Moira Orfei in Aigues-Mortes with a new title, Circus, and to acquire and publish new ones. It is distributed to the book trade by Publishers Group West.
