Chhaupadi
Chhaupadi (Nepali: छाउपडी Listen ) is a form of menstrual taboo which prohibits Hindu women and girls from participating in normal family activities while menstruating, as they are considered "impure". Chhaupadi is practiced primarily in the western part of Nepal.

The practice persists in rural areas primarily in Western
