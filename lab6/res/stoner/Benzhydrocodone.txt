Benzhydrocodone
Benzhydrocodone (INN) (contracted from benzoate-hydrocodone) is an opioid prodrug of the morphinan class. Its chemical structure consists of hydrocodone coupled with benzoic acid. Benzhydrocodone itself is inactive and acts as a prodrug to hydrocodone upon cleavage of the benzoate portion of the molecule.It is designed to be an opioid analgesic with a low chance of recreational use.Created by Kempharm, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company in Coralville, Iowa, President and CEO, Travis Mickle, believes the molecular-based approach to abuse deterrent may be more effective than many formulation-based approaches. However, benzhydrocodone-acetaminophen (Apadazâ„¢) did not receive abuse-deterrent status when it became FDA approved in February 2018. FDA approval The Food and Drug Administration approved benzhydrocodone and acetaminophen (Apada) for the short-term (no more than 14 days) management of acute pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and where alternative treatments are inadequate. It was not classified as an abuse-deterrent agent. Clinical pharmacology Benzhydrocodone is a prodrug of hydrocodone. Hydrocodone is a full agonist of the opioid receptors with a higher affinity for the mu-opioid receptor. Upon binding, hydrocodone produces an analgesic effect with no ceiling. The exact mechanism of analgesia is unknown. Acetaminophen is a non-opioid, non-salicylate analgesic. The specific mechanism of analgesia
