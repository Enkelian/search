Astatine monochloride
An interhalogen compound is a molecule which contains two or more different halogen atoms (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, or astatine) and no atoms of elements from any other group. Most interhalogen compounds known are binary (composed of only two distinct elements). Their formulae are generally XYn, where n = 1, 3, 5 or 7, and X is the less electronegative of the two halogens. The value of "n" in interhalogens is always odd, because of the odd valence of halogens. They are all prone to hydrolysis, and ionize to give rise to polyhalogen ions. Those formed with astatine have a very short half-life due to astatine being intensely radioactive. No interhalogen compounds containing three or more different halogens are definitely known, although a few books claim that IFCl2 and IF2Cl have been obtained, and theoretical studies seem to indicate that some compounds in the series BrClFn are barely stable. Types of interhalogens Diatomic interhalogens The interhalogens of form XY have physical properties intermediate between those of the two parent halogens. The covalent bond between the two atoms has some ionic character, the less electronegative halogen, X, being oxidised and having a partial positive charge.
