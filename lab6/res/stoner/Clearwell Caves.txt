Clearwell Caves
Clearwell Caves, at Clearwell in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, England, is a natural cave system which has been extensively mined for iron ore. It now operates primarily as a mining museum. The caves are part of a Natural England designated Site of Special Scientific Interest and the notification includes parts of Clearwell along with Old Bow, Lambsquay and Old Ham mine complexes. Mining Clearwell Caves are a collection of six mines; Clearwell, Old Ham, Lambsquay, Old Bow, Oak Pit, New Dunn. The interconnected cave systems were formed by underground streams from around 180 million years ago. They have been mined originally for ochre, then for iron ore from Iron Age times Circa 100BC increasing from Roman times and extensively in the last century, which considerably enlarged and extended the network of natural caverns. Ochre has been mined here for even longer.The nearby scowles at the Secret Forest and Puzzlewood represent shallow surface mines which have been exposed from above and later became entrances to the deeper mines. Clearwell Caves are still worked intermittently to produce coloured ochres for use as natural pigments. These are washed and milled for sale in the mine's own shop. A range of ochre colours
