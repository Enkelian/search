Armadillo World Headquarters
Armadillo World Headquarters (sometimes called simply The 'Dillo) was a music venue and nightclub in Austin, Texas, from 1970 to 1980. It was located at 505 Barton Springs Road in Austin. After its demolition, it was replaced by a 13-story office building. History In 1970, Austin's flagship rock music venue, the Vulcan Gas Company, closed, leaving the city's nascent live music scene without an incubator. One night, Eddie Wilson, manager of the local group Shiva's Headband, stepped outside a nightclub where the band was playing and noticed an old, abandoned National Guard armory. Wilson found an unlocked garage door on the building and was able to view the cavernous interior using the headlights of his automobile. He had a desire to continue the legacy of the Vulcan Gas Company, and was inspired by what he saw in the armory to create a new music hall in the derelict structure. The armory was estimated to have been built in 1948, but no records of its construction could be located. The building was ugly, uncomfortable, and had poor acoustics, but offered cheap rent and a central location. Posters for the venue usually noted the address as 525Â½ Barton Springs Road (Rear), behind
