Proto 2
Proto 2 is the name of the $55 million initiative of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, to create a thought-controlled prosthetic arm. Its predecessor was called Proto 1 and was capable of reasonably complicated movements like rolling the shoulders, wrists, flexing the fingers. etc. Proto 2 is a critical milestone of thought-controlled mechanical arms. It is complete with hand and articulated fingersâ€”that can perform 25 joint motions. This dexterity approaches that of a real arm (which makes about 30 motions)- a great improvement over the Proto 1. A person wearing a Proto 2 could "conceivably play the piano".The next steps are to shrink the battery, develop more-efficient motors, and refine the bulky electrodes used to read electrical signals in muscles. How it works Control SystemResearchers are experimenting with injectable myoelectric sensors (IMES) that detect muscle activity and wirelessly transmit commands to the prosthetic arm- in order to eliminate the bulkiness. A wire coil wrapped over the shoulder supplies wireless power to the implants and relays signals to computers in the prosthetic that decipher the command and tell the arm to move. The team is also considering implanting electrodes directly on nerves. PowerResearchers are exploring a hydrogen-peroxide pneumatic
