Acarichthys
The threadfin acara (Acarichthys heckelii), also known as Heckel's thread-finned acara, is a South American species of cichlid fish. It is the only member of the genus Acarichthys and is native to rivers in the Amazon and Essequibo basins in tropical South America, and has become established in southeastern Asia. It is sometimes found in the aquarium trade. Taxonomy and etymology The threadfin acara was first described in 1848 by the German zoologists J. P. MÃ¼ller and Troschel as Acara heckelii, and in 1912 was placed by Eigenmann in the monotypic genus Acarichthys. The specific name honours the ichthyologyst Johann Jakob Heckel, director of the Vienna Museum of Natural History, who studied and catalogued fish sent to him by collectors. Its common name is the "threadfin acara", referring to the elongated, free rays at the posterior end of the dorsal fin. The specific name honours the Austrian ichthyologist Johann Jakob Heckel (1790-1857), one of the pioneers in the study of cichlids. Description This is a laterally-compressed, deep-bodied fish with a brownish-silver upper body, silvery flanks and a pale belly. There is a vertical black streak below the eye, a black blotch on the front few rays of the dorsal fin
