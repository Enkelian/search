North Wales TV
North Wales TV (formerly Made in North Wales) is a local television station serving Mold, Denbigh, Ruthin and surrounding areas. The station is owned and operated by Local Television Limited and forms part of a group of eight local TV stations. The station's local production staff are based in offices in Wrexham. Overview In January 2014, the broadcast regulator OFCOM announced it had awarded Bay TV a licence to broadcast the local TV service for Mold and surrounding areas - one of the smallest licences of its kind in the UK. The Mold licence had also been contested by a locally based group known as Serch TV Mold. A year before, the owners of Bay TV Clwyd had already secured a licence for the Liverpool area, but the company was denied a licence to run a service for the Bangor area of Gwynedd, amid concerns about the viability of the proposed station.Bay TV Clwyd was due to start broadcasting in October 2014, but the company said it had faced long delays because of problems with the Moel-y-Parc transmitter. Bay TV's Liverpool service began broadcasting in December 2014, but fell into administration in August 2016. It was sold to Made Television
