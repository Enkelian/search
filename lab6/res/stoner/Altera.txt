Altera
Altera Corporation was a leading American manufacturer of programmable logic devices (PLDs, reconfigurable complex digital circuits), from 1984 through 2015. Altera released its first PLD in 1984.Altera and Intel announced on June 1, 2015 that they had agreed that Intel would acquire Altera in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $16.7 billion. As of December 28, 2015, the acquisition had been completed.The main product lines from Altera (now Intel) are the Stratix, Arria and Cyclone series FPGAs, the MAX series CPLDs and non-volatile FPGAs, Quartus design software, and Enpirion PowerSoC DC-DC power solutions. Products FPGAs The Stratix series FPGAs are the company's largest, highest bandwidth devices, with up to 1.1 million logic elements, integrated transceivers at up to 28 Gbit/s, up to 1.6 Tbit/s of serial switching capability, up to 1,840 GMACs of signal-processing performance, and up to 7 x72 DDR3 memory interfaces at 800 MHz.Cyclone series FPGAs and SoC FPGAs are the company's lowest cost, lowest power FPGAs, with variants offering integrated transceivers up to 5 Gbit/s. In between these two device families are Arria series FPGAs, which provide a balance of performance, power, and cost for mid-range applications such as remote radio heads, video conferencing equipment, and wireline
