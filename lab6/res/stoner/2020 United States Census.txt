2020 United States Census
The United States Census of 2020 is the twenty-fourth United States Census. Census Day, the reference day used for the census, was April 1, 2020. Other than a pilot study during the 2000 census, this is the first U.S. census to offer options to respond online or by phone, in addition to the option to respond on a paper form as with previous censuses. Introduction As required by the United States Constitution, the U.S. Census has been conducted every 10 years since 1790. The 2010 United States Census was the previous census completed. All persons in the U.S. age 18 years and older are legally obligated to answer census questions, and to do so truthfully (Title 13 of the United States Code). Personally identifiable information is private and the Census Bureau will never release it. However, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) would plan to release the original census returns in 2092, if the 72-year rule is not changed before then. On Census reference day, 1 April 2020, the resident United States population (50 states + DC, excluding overseas territories, military members stationed abroad and civilian US citizens living abroad) was projected to be 329.5 million, a 6.7% increase
