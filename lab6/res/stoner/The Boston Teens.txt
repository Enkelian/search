The Boston Teens are fictional characters featured on the American television show Saturday Night Live. "The Boston Teens" debuted in 1999 and have appeared in 14 sketches to date. TV Guide named The Boston Teens among Saturday Night Live's 40 greatest characters in a list compiled in honor of the show's 40th anniversary in 2015. About Denise "Zazu" McDenna (Rachel Dratch) and Pat Sullivan or "Sully" (Jimmy Fallon) are a pair of Lexington, Massachusetts, teenagers in love. The teens and their friends speak in a highly affected Boston accent. The sketches are presented in the format of home video footage filmed by their unseen friend Tommy. They have a torrid relationship, often arguing and making up in the same sentence. A prime example of this is Denise's tendency to say, "You're retarded!" or "You're so queer!" to which Sully replies, "You are" and immediately starts making out with her. The sketches usually end with one of the participants making a Freudian slip and Sully hoping that Tommy caught it on camera. The characters are very devoted fans of the Boston Red Sox. Sully typically wears a Boston Red Sox shirt, and Denise usually wears a blue and gold varsity jacket
