California Golden Bears baseball
The California Golden Bears baseball team represents the University of California in NCAA Division I college baseball. Along with most other California athletic teams, the baseball team participates in the Pac-12 Conference. The Bears play their home games at Evans Diamond. History The Bears have appeared in the NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament 13 times, and in the College World Series 6 times. They have won two National Championships: at the first College World Series in 1947 and again in 1957. In 1964, future major leaguer Mike Epstein batted .384 for the team and was named an All-American. In 2010, the university announced that baseball would be one of five sports cut as a cost-cutting measure. However, in April 2011, after receiving more than $9 million in pledges from supporters of the program, the program was reinstated. Even donors from Stanford University, California's biggest rival, pitched in to help save the Golden Bears baseball team.
