Fountain Square Tower
Fountain Square Tower is a 35 story and 385 ft. tall (Originally set for 55 stories and 523 ft.) skyscraper set for construction on Church Street in Evanston, Illinois. The building, if completed as originally proposed, would have been the tallest building in Illinois outside of Chicago. After protest, the building's height was changed from 55 stories to 38 stories. After more protest, the building was changed to its now planned height and is not to get any smaller. The building would consist of a parking garage with car elevator, a very large shopping center, and luxury condominium residences. The building has an unknown completion date. Construction still has not started and the plan will likely be scrapped due to public dissent. The developers have until 2015 to start construction before the building becomes un- approved.
