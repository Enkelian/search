Andrew Hull
Andrew Mackenzie Hull (August 15, 1963 â€“ May 8, 2010) was a Canadian born film maker, film director and architect. He was born in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada, and died in London, England. Early life Andrew Hull was the youngest of three children born to Ralph Hull, psychiatrist, and Margot Finley, artist. He spent his childhood in Ann Arbor, Michigan and Peterborough, Ontario, attended Lakefield College School as a boy, and studied architecture at Carleton University, Ottawa. During his studies in 1989 he won the AIA/ACSA Research Council-Otis Elevator International Student Competition for his mixed-use commercial, retail and residential design for a development in historic London. Despite this accolade his interests shifted to film and video. Being one of the first students to work with video at the School of Architecture, he graduated with an experimental video work about a cryptic symbol of a traced hand that appears in the urban environment. This first completed video marked his move from architecture into narrative film. Film career While working as an architect in Paris in 1991, Andrew Hull was invited to Germany by Carleton University colleagues Stephen Kovats and Ian Johnston to work on video and animation projects and to mentor students
