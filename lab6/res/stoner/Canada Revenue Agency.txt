Canada Revenue Agency
The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA; French: Agence du revenu du Canada, ARC), is the revenue service of the Government of Canada that is responsible for the collection of taxation and administration of tax laws and tax policy, such as international trade legislation, and various social and economic benefit and incentive programs delivered through the tax system, for the federal government and most provincial and territorial governments. It also oversees the registration of charities in Canada, and tax credit programmes. It was previously known as the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency and Revenue Canada before that. History The CRA was formed in 1999 as the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (CCRA) until a federal government reorganization in December 2003, when customs enforcement was transferred to the newly formed Canada Border Services Agency, and the agency was renamed to its present name. The CCRA was short-lived, having been created in a reorganization of the federal government, where it had been known for many years under its statutory name, the Department of National Revenue. Before 1927, it was known as the Department of Inland Revenue. It was also referred to as Revenue Canada under the Federal Identity Program of the Treasury Board of
