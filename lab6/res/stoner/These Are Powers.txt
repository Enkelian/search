These Are Powers
These Are Powers was an American experimental music group from Brooklyn, New York and Chicago, Illinois, United States. The band mixes polyrhythm with samples and other electronic sounds and noise rock. History These Are Powers were an avant-garde, experimental noise dance band from Brooklyn, New York founded by singer and guitarist Anna Barie and bassist Pat Noecker (Liars) in 2006. 2006-2008 With drummer Ted McGrath, These Are Powers recorded the Silver Lung 7" and Terrific Seasons LP originally released on HOSS Records and later re-released by Dead Oceans. The early recordings were inspired by African polyrhythms, Der Blaue Reiter, John Cage, Alice Coltrane, and Pandit Pran Nath. During this period, the band founded the genre of Ghost Punk and often drew comparisons to arty experimenters Sonic Youth, Throbbing Gristle and This Heat. Live shows were treated as loud, psychedelic exorcisms with long, improvised passages. 2008-2011 Producer Bill Salas (Brenmar) replaced McGrath as drummer for These Are Powers originally on a standing electro-acoustic drum kit before transitioning later into more electronic production. The band wrote their Taro Tarot EP and the All Aboard Future LP in Salas' hometown of Chicago between several American and Canadian DIY tours. Influences at this time
