Afterwords (The Gathering album)
Afterwords is the eleventh studio album by the Dutch alternative rock band The Gathering released via Psychonaut label on 25 October 2013. Background The record is the last album before the band went on hiatus and bassist Marjolein Kooijman quit in 2014. Afterwords is somewhat a continuation of the previous album, Disclosure, containing remakes of five of the songs. De-constructed to just a few main elements, with a melody and perhaps a few lyrics retained, the songs start almost from scratch to build up completely different compositions.S.I.B.A.L.D. stands for "Sometimes it's better a little dusty". Areas is a cover of synthpop band New Musik from their 1981 album Anywhere.
