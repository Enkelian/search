44 Montgomery
44 Montgomery is a 43-story, 172 m (564 ft) office skyscraper in the heart of San Francisco's Financial District. When completed in 1967, it was the tallest building west of Dallas, it was surpassed by 555 California Street (the former world headquarters of Bank of America) in 1969. The building was designed, built and dedicated for Wells Fargo Bank, and their IT subsidiary was based there at one time (the bank's headquarters are at 464 California Street). The building was sold by AT&T in 1997 for US$111 million. 44 Montgomery, as part of the original design anticipating the then-under-construction Bay Area Rapid Transit subway system, contains direct underground access to the Montgomery Street Station.
