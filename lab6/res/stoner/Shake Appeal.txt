Shake Appeal
Shake Appeal is the name of a rock group from Oxford, England from 1984-1989. The last line-up of the band evolved into Swervedriver. Origins The band took their name from a Stooges song off the album Raw Power. Their primary influences were the Stooges and the MC5. The first song the band learned to play was "Search and Destroy". The original line-up was Graham Franklin (vocals), Jimmy Hartridge (guitar) (both previously in The Roadrunners), Adam Franklin (guitar) and Paddy Pulzer (drums) (both previously in Splatter Babies). Original bass player Paul Wilson left, and was replaced by Richard Mason, who was in turn replaced by Adi Vines. Early career Throughout 1986, the band played in Oxford, Brighton, and London. They played one show at a squat in Hackney called the Blue House with an early incarnation of My Bloody Valentine, who at the time closed their set with a version of the Stooges' Shake Appeal. After the departure of Wilson in 1986, the band recorded a four-song demo EP featuring the songs "Amphetamine", "Freedom", "Gimme Fever", and "Train Train" with Franklin on bass. The demo was reviewed in Underground magazine, who described the band as sounding "like MC5 with their shirts
