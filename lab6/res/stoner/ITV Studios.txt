ITV Studios
ITV Studios is a television production company owned by the British television broadcaster ITV plc. Based in 12 countries across 60 production labels, with local production offices in the UK, America, Australia, Germany, The Netherlands, Italy, Israel, France and Scandinavia. History ITV Studios Limited's history can be traced back to Granada Productions, which was founded in 1954 as Granada Television's in-house production arm, and Central Television Enterprises, Central Independent Television's international sales operations founded in 1987. Granada Productions and Carlton International (re-branded name for CTE) were merged in 2009 to form ITV Studios; however, some of ITV Studios' subsidiaries, such as ITV Studios Australia, still carried the Granada name until 2014. ITV Studios not only makes programmes primarily for its parent company ITV plc, but also for other networks such as the BBC and Channel 4. It was formed from a gradual amalgamation of the production divisions of all ITV plc owned 'channel three' licensees which occurred from 1994 to 2004, and for a number of years thereafter following the creation of ITV plc. The division is also responsible for ITV's production facilities The London Studios, 3SixtyMedia (based at ITV Granada, and co-owned with BBC Studios and Post Production), and
