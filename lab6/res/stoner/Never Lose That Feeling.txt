Background After showing an interest for collaborating with the band, engineer and producer Alan Moulder met the band at Greenhouse Studios, where the EP was recorded. Following the recording, the band embarked a North American tour. Drummer Graham Bonnar left the band while touring. After the mixing and the release of the EP, the band continued with the second leg of touring, which ended up with bassist Adi Vines departing the band.Guitarist Jimmy Hartridge viewed the title track's riff as "a bit of a bridge between Raise and Mezcal Head in some ways." Critical reception Andy Kellman of Allmusic stated that "the EP is pretty much obsolete for those who own A&M's Reel to Real promo EP." Track listing All songs written by Swervedriver.
