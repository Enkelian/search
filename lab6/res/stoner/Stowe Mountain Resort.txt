Stowe Mountain Resort
Stowe Mountain Resort is a ski resort in the northeastern United States, near the town of Stowe in northern Vermont, comprising two separate mountains: Mount Mansfield and Spruce Peak. The lift-served vertical drop of Mount Mansfield is 2,360 feet (719 m), the fifth largest in New England and the fourth largest in Vermont. History Alpine skiing came to Vermont when the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) cut the first trails on Mount Mansfield in 1933. The National Ski Patrol was based on the Mount Mansfield Ski Patrol, the oldest in the nation founded in 1934. Stowe Mountain Resort was long owned in its entirety by the Mount Mansfield Company. It in turn was owned since 1949 by insurance mogul C.V. Starr, founder of the American International Group. AIG became the primary owner in 1988, until selling ski-related operations and facilities at the resort to Vail Resorts on February 21, 2017. AIG and the Mount Mansfield Company will retain the Stowe Mountain Lodge, Stowe Mountain Club, Stowe Country Club and other real estate owned and held for potential future development.With $37 million in revenue during Winter 2007-08, Stowe placed second to Killington Ski Resort's $37.3 million in Vermont.
