Coca-Cola headquarters
The Coca-Cola Headquarters is a campus in Atlanta, Georgia that is home to The Coca-Cola Company in the city's midtown. The most visible building on the site is a 29-story, 403 foot (122.8 m) high structure called One Coca-Cola Plaza. Located on the corner of North Avenue and Luckie Street, the International Style building was completed in 1979. The architect was FABRAP and the designer Bob Foker. The building and complex is located across the street from Georgia Institute of Technology and Midtown Atlanta. In May 2011, to celebrate the 125th anniversary of Coca-Cola, a projection screen was made for the building that would display various Coke ads through the years and also transformed the building into a huge cup of ice which then was "filled" with Coke.
