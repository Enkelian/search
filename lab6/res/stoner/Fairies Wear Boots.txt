Fairies Wear Boots
"Fairies Wear Boots" is a song by the English heavy metal band Black Sabbath, appearing on their 1970 album Paranoid. It was released in 1971 as the B-side to the single "After Forever". Composition The exact inspiration behind "Fairies Wear Boots" is unclear. In the 2010 documentary film Classic Albums: Black Sabbath's Paranoid, the band's bassist and lyricist Geezer Butler states that he composed the lyrics after a violent encounter with skinheads in London, who are the "fairies" in the song. However, in the 2004 release of Black Box: The Complete Original Black Sabbath (1970â€“1978), guitarist Tony Iommi states that the lyrics were inspired by an incident in which Butler and vocalist Ozzy Osbourne were smoking cannabis and witnessed what they believed to be fairies in a park In Osbourne's autobiography I Am Ozzy, he stated that he does not recall what the song was written about. On original 1970 US copies of the Paranoid album, the song's intro was listed under the title "Jack the Stripper".The song has been ranked the 11th best Black Sabbath song by author Christoph Rehe.
