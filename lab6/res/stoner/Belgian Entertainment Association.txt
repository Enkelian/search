Belgian Entertainment Association
The Belgian Entertainment Association (BEA) is the organization that represents the interests of the music, video and video game industries in Belgium. It was founded in February 2008, when three organizations merged, namely IFPI Belgium, the local chapter of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), which represented the music industry, the Belgian Video Federation, which represented the video industry, and the Belgian Luxembourg Interactive Software Association, which represented the video game industry. BEA is listed as the local record industry association in Belgium by the IFPI. Sales charts The publication of sales charts in Belgium is done through Ultratop, a non-profit organization created BEA. Due to the cultural differences in Belgium, separate charts are published for the Dutch-speaking Flanders region and the French-speaking Wallonia region. In Flanders the most important charts are the Ultratop 50 singles and the Ultratop 50 albums. In Wallonia the most important charts are the Ultratop 40 singles. Certifications Through Ultratop, BEA certifies albums, singles and DVDs. The thresholds are as follows. Albums and singles The current thresholds for albums, in effect at least since April 2007, distinguish between local, French or Dutch speaking albums ("domestic"), and international or non French or Dutch speaking
