Cobb Theatres
Cobb Theatres is an American cinema chain based in Birmingham, Alabama. The company was established in 1921, in Fayette, Alabama expanding through the South, and buying out General Cinema and Wometco Theatres. Cobb presently operates 19 locations with 232 screens, the majority of which are located in Florida, with others in Alabama, Georgia, Colorado, Ohio, North Carolina, and Virginia. In October 2017, Mexican cinema chain Cinemex announced its intent to acquire Cobb via its CMX subsidiary (which it had used to launch U.S. locations with a premium cinema concept), which will make it the eighth-largest U.S. cinema chain with 30 locations.
