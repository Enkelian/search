Compañía Logística de Hidrocarburos
The CLH Group, which is made up of Compañía Logística de Hidrocarburos, CLH S.A. and its subsidiary company, CLH Aviación S.A., is the leading company in Spain for the transportation and storage of oil products. The company has an 85-year history, as it comes from what used to be (CAMPSA) (Compañía Arrendataria del Monopolio de Petróleos). CLH is the result of the spin-off, in 1992, of the commercial assets of the former CAMPSA that was carried out as the culmination of the process for deregulating the oil sector after the approval of new European Community laws that ended the oil monopoly. The CLH Group's main activity consists of transporting oil products – essentially gasolines, diesels, fuel oils and aviation fuels – from the refineries to the storage facilities the company has distributed across the whole of Spain, where its customers' tank trucks load these products and deliver them to the end consumers. CLH holds logistics service contracts for the use of its facilities with most of the operators that do business in Spain, and competes with more than a dozen logistics companies that provide the Spanish market with storage and transportation services.
