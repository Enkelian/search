Drenge (band)
Drenge are an English three-piece rock band made up of Eoin Loveless, on guitar and vocals, his younger brother Rory, on drums, and Rob Graham on bass. The brothers grew up in Castleton, Derbyshire, where they formed the band in 2010, relocating to Sheffield in 2014. The band take their name from something "that would sound like a noise that we would be playing onstage." Their name also translates into "Boys" in Danish. They have released three albums, Drenge (2013), Undertow (2015), and Strange Creatures (2019). Background In January 2013, Drenge, who had a small following at the time, were picked up by national media when The Guardian's Paul Lester featured them in his "New band of the week" column. The band rose to further prominence seven months later following the resignation of Labour MP Tom Watson from the Shadow Cabinet in July 2013. Watson wrote in his resignation letter on his blog: "be that great Labour leader that you can be, but try to have a real life too. And if you want to see an awesome band, I recommend Drenge."Drenge have toured extensively in the UK, and have appeared at Glastonbury Festival, Latitude Festival, and Reading and Leeds
