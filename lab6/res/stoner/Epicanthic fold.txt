Epicanthic fold
An epicanthic fold is a skin fold of the upper eyelid that covers the inner corner (medial canthus) of the eye. However, variation occurs in the nature of this feature and the possession of 'partial epicanthic folds' or 'slight epicanthic folds' is noted in the relevant literature. Various factors influence whether epicanthic folds form, including ancestry, age, and certain medical conditions. Classification Variation in the shape of the epicanthic fold has led to four types being recognised: Epicanthus supraciliaris runs from the brow, curving downwards towards the lachrymal sac. Epicanthus palpebralis begins above the upper tarsus and extends to the inferior orbital rim. Epicanthus tarsalis originates at the upper eyelid crease and merges into the skin near the medial canthus. This is the type most often found in East Asians. Epicanthus inversus runs from the lower eyelid skin over the medial canthus and extends to the upper lid. Ethnogeographic distribution High frequency populations The highest frequency of occurrence of epicanthic folds is found in specific ethnicities: East Asians, Southeast Asians, Central Asians, North Asians, Polynesians, Micronesians, Native Americans (including Mestizos), the Khoisan, and the Malagasy. Among South Asians, they occur at very high frequencies among the Bhutanese, Northeast Indians, Kirati,
