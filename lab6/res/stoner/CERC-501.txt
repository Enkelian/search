CERC-501
Aticaprant (developmental codes CERC-501 and LY-2456302) is a selective antagonist of the κ-opioid receptor (KOR) which was originally developed by Eli Lilly and is now under development by Janssen Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of major depressive disorder and substance use disorders including alcoholism, nicotine addiction, and illicit drug dependence. Pharmacology Pharmacodynamics Aticaprant is a potent, selective, short-acting (i.e., non-"inactivating") antagonist of the KOR (Ki = 0.81 nM vs. 24.0 nM and 155 nM for the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) and δ-opioid receptor (DOR), respectively; approximately 30-fold selectivity for the KOR). The drug has been found to dose-dependently block fentanyl-induced miosis at 25 mg and 60 mg in humans (with minimal to no blockade at doses of 4 to 10 mg), suggesting that the drug significantly occupies and antagonizes the MOR at a dose of at least 25 mg but not of 10 mg or less. However, a more recent study assessing neuroendocrine effects of the drug in normal volunteers and subjects with a history of cocaine dependence reported observations consistent with modest MOR antagonism at the 10 mg dose. In animal models of depression, aticaprant has been found to have potent synergistic efficacy in combination with other antidepressants such as citalopram
