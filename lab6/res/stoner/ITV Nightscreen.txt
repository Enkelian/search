ITV Nightscreen
ITV Nightscreen is a scheduled programme on the ITV television network, consisting of a sequence of animated pages of information about ITV's upcoming programmes, features and special events, with an easy listening music soundtrack. The programme is used to fill the station's overnight downtime, where a closedown would have once been used at the end of programmes. The programme is generally shown 7 days a week with the typical weekday show airing from 03:50am - 05:05am daily. On STV, UTV and in the Channel Islands the programme starts earlier, sometimes as early as midnight, breaking for a signed programme at 3am before resuming and occasionally in Scotland it has been known to broadcast continually from 1:00 am to 6:00 am without a break.

Very occasionally it is not broadcast due to live events and other programming filling its hour. The programme also broadcasts on all of ITV's +1 channels. It
