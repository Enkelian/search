Magnetic Morning
Magnetic Morning (formerly known as The Setting Suns) is an indie rock duo made up of Swervedriver singer/guitarist and solo artist Adam Franklin and Interpol drummer Sam Fogarino. The two met in early 2006 in New York City when they were introduced over dinner by long term, mutual friend, Jack Rabid and officially formed at the end of 2006.Magnetic Morning released their debut six-track EP as "The Setting Suns" on iTunes on 18 October 2007. Soon after, they renamed their collaboration after a 2003 song by Franklin's moniker Toshack Highway "due to an already existing entity with a name too close for comfort". A five-track CD version of EP was released through DH Records on 19 April 2008. Magnetic Morning followed with their first full-length album A.M. a little over a year later in January 2009.
