Philips Intimate Massagers
The Philips Intimate Massager is a range of electric personal massagers made by Philips which were first introduced to the UK market during 2008. When the line was launched, commentators questioned whether Philips' movement into the sex-toy market was a sign that sex-toys were gaining mainstream acceptance. After only two years, however, the line was discontinued due to "lack of demand".
