Paul Gray (English musician)
Paul Gray (born 1 August 1958, Rochford, Essex, England) is the bassist for the Southend-on-Sea rock band Eddie and the Hot Rods, which had several hit singles and albums in the late 1970s, including "Do Anything You Wanna Do". In early 1980, he joined the punk rock band The Damned to replace Algy Ward (who moved on to form Tank) on bass. Gray contributed to two studio albums, The Black Album and Strawberries, but left the band in February 1983. After a brief stint with Swedish metallers Heavy Load in 1986, he joined UFO and remained until their split in 1987. He has also sessioned live and on records for artists including Johnny Thunders, Rob Tyner (MC5) and Andrew Ridgeley (formerly of Wham!).In 1989 Gray rejoined The Damned, ostensibly for a one-off reunion tour of the UK, US, and Japan. For the next eight years these became an annual event, with both Gray and Captain Sensible touring and recording with their own band in-between other commitments, with Gray also reforming Eddie & the Hot Rods for one album, Gasoline Days, for which he contributed the songwriting, and supported the album with several tours in the UK and Germany.Gray was Lead
