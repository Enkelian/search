Manx Radio
Manx Radio (legally Radio Manx Ltd.) (Manx: Radio Vannin) is the national commercial radio station for the Isle of Man. It began broadcasting on 29 June 1964, almost ten years before commercial radio was licensed in the United Kingdom. The Isle of Man, having its own government and laws, was not subject to the rules prohibiting commercial broadcasting in the UK. However, the Manx Government still had to apply to the UK's General Post Office for a frequency and for permission to broadcast. First requested in 1960, a licence was eventually granted in May 1964. It was allocated an FM frequency of 89.0 MHz and a comparatively low power of 50 watts. In October 1964, an additional frequency of 1600 kHz AM was allocated to the station to provide greater coverage, although again at a limited power of 50 watts. It broadcasts mainly in English with a few hours a week devoted to broadcasting in Manx. Current frequencies Manx Radio now broadcasts on 1368 kHz AM to the whole island; 89.0 MHz (from Snaefell) for the north of the island; 97.2 MHz FM (from Douglas/Carnane) for the south of the island; and 103.7 MHz (from Jurby) for the island's hills.
