15th arrondissement of Paris
The 15th arrondissement of Paris (XVe arrondissement) is one of the 20 arrondissements of the capital city of France. In spoken French, this arrondissement is referred to as quinzième. The arrondissement, called Vaugirard, is situated on the left bank of the River Seine. Sharing the Montparnasse district with the 6th and 14th arrondissements, it is the city's most populous arrondissement. The Tour Montparnasse – the tallest skyscraper in Paris – and the neighbouring Gare Montparnasse are both located in the 15th arrondissement, at its border with the 14th. It is also home to the convention center Paris expo Porte de Versailles and the high-rise district of the Front de Seine (or Beaugrenelle). In 2020, the 180 meters high Tour Triangle will house a 120-room hotel and 70,000 square metres of office space. History The loi du 16 juin 1859 decreed the annexation to Paris of the area between the old Wall of the Ferme générale and the wall of Thiers. The communes of Grenelle, Vaugirard, and Javel were incorporated into Paris in 1860.
