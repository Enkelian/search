According to traditional superstition, such clovers bring good luck, though it is not clear when or how this superstition began. The earliest mention of "Fower-leafed or purple grasse" is from 1640 and simply says that it was kept in gardens because it was "good for the purples in children or others". A description from 1869 says that four-leaf clovers were "gathered at night-time during the full moon by sorceresses, who mixed it with vervain and other ingredients, while young girls in search of a token of perfect happiness made quest of the plant by day".

However, an actual survey of over 5 million clovers found the real frequency to be closer to 5,000 to 1, twice the said probability.Even so, this probability has not deterred collectors who have reached records as high as 160,000
