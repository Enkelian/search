All Shook Up (Cheap Trick album)
All Shook Up is the fifth studio album by American rock band Cheap Trick. Released in 1980, it was produced by former Beatles producer George Martin. As such, this was the first studio album since their debut to be produced by someone other than Tom Werman. Overview All Shook Up was even quirkier than its predecessor, the platinum-selling Dream Police. Many of its songs were less radio friendly and more experimental, and the cover art, influenced by Magritte's Time Transfixed, led many to question what the band was trying to accomplish. However, at the time, Cheap Trick had severed ties with long-time producer Tom Werman and took the opportunity to take their sound in a different direction. With the assistance of producer George Martin and engineer Geoff Emerick, many of the songs have a dimension not found on any other Cheap Trick album. "Stop This Game" was the only single to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, but "Just Got Back" and "World's Greatest Lover" continue to be fan favorites. "I Love You Honey But I Hate Your Friends" contains a lyrical reference to "Daddy Should Have Stayed In High School", a song, released on the band's 1977 debut album.
