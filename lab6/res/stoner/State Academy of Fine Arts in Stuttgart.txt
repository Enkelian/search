Sonderborg, Alfred Hrdlicka, Marianne Eigenheer, Joseph Kosuth, Joan Jonas, Micha Ullman, offers from all art universities in the federal state Baden-Württemberg the largest numbers of courses, namely all disciplines of the visual field, and not just in an organizational network but also under one roof.
