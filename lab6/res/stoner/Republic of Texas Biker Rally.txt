Republic of Texas Biker Rally
The Republic of Texas Biker Rally (R. O. T Biker Rally) is the largest motorcycle rally in Texas and the largest turnstile (ticketed admission) motorcycle rally in the United States. Similar events in Sturgis, South Dakota, and Daytona Beach, Florida, draw more attendees, but they are not ticketed events. A simple majority of attendees arrive on Harley-Davidson motorcycles, but the rally is open to everyone and all brands of bikes. Many attendees arrive in motor homes and stay on the premises.The four-day event is held on the first, second, or third Thursday-through-Sunday after Memorial Day at the Travis County Exposition Center on the east edge of Austin. The City of Austin blocks off the downtown area for a massive biker street party on Congress Avenue on Friday night. The first R. O. T. Rally was held in 1995, and it has been an annual event ever since. It constitutes one of the largest annual tourist events in Central Texas, with an estimated economic impact of 30-35,000,000 dollars per year. The event has drawn as many as 35,000 paying customers to the event grounds. City officials have estimated that the Friday night street party downtown draws as many as 200,000 spectators
