The organization implements development programs in Asia, Africa and Latin America, focusing on education, water, health, food and economic opportunity. It also runs domestic programming for young people in Canada, the U.S. and U.K., promoting service learning and active citizenship.This includes WE Day, a series of large-scale motivational events held in 17 cities throughout the school year. We Charity promotes a philosophy of socially conscious living, embodied in the phrase "ME to WE" â€“ the title of a 2004 book by Craig and Marc Kielburger. That brand theme "we" is reflected in the organization's programs such as its WE Day events, launched in 2007, leading up to an updated branding of "We Charity" in early 2015. The organization has received high ratings from independent third-party charitable sector evaluators including Charity Navigator, and Charity Intelligence Canada GuideStar, History WE Charity (formerly Free the Children) was founded in 1995 by Craig Kielburger when he was 12 years old.
