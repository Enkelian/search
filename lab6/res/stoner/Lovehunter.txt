Cover art Lovehunter's controversial cover art, showing a naked woman straddling a large snake, was created by fantasy artist Chris Achilleos. It was the last album cover he designed for many years, until 2003 and Gary Hughes' rock opera Once and Future King Part I. The original Lovehunter artwork was stolen in the 1980s.A similar idea had been used three years earlier for the cover of Jon Lord's Sarabande album. Lord was in Whitesnake at the time of Lovehunter.
