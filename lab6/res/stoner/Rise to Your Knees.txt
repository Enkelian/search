Rise to Your Knees is the Meat Puppets' eleventh full-length studio album, released on July 17, 2007. Not only was it their first studio release since 2000's Golden Lies, it was also their first to feature the original bassist Cris Kirkwood since his departure after the release of 1995's No Joke!. The album was given a one-month advance release on the iTunes Store and eMusic. An earlier version of "Enemy Love Song" was available for download on Curt Kirkwood's official website in 2005 prior to the release of his solo album Snow.
