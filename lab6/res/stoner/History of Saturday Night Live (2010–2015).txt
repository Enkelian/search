Opening montage The opening montage remained the same as the previous season's, but with Will Forte and Jenny Slate removed. Scenes with Vanessa Bayer (sitting at an outdoor cafe), Paul Brittain (riding a bike down Midtown), Taran Killam (playing table tennis), and Jay Pharoah (showing off his breakdancing moves) were added. Bumper format The commercial bumpers remained mostly the same as the previous season. All references of SNL's 35 years on the air were removed. Some bumpers showcased the host or musical guest(s) moving. Cast Notes Will Forte,
