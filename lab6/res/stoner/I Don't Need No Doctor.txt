I Don't Need No Doctor
"I Don't Need No Doctor" is an R&B song written by Nick Ashford, Valerie Simpson, and Jo Armstead. First released by Nick Ashford on Verve in August 1966, it went nowhere. It was then picked up and recorded by Ray Charles and released in October 1966. Over the years, it has been covered by bands such as garage rock band The Chocolate Watchband in 1969, Humble Pie in 1971, New Riders of the Purple Sage in 1972, metal band W.A.S.P. in 1986, by rock band Great White in 1987, and by the garage punk band The Nomads in 1989. Styx also covered this song. Humble Pie's version became an FM radio hit and reached #73 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. The jazz guitar player John Scofield recorded a version for his album That's What I Say: John Scofield Plays the Music of Ray Charles in 2005, featuring the blues guitarist John Mayer on additional guitar and vocals. Mayer covered the song again with his band during his tour in summer 2007. A recorded live version from a Los Angeles show during that tour is available on Mayer's CD/DVD release Where the Light Is.
