After Hours (Glenn Frey album)
After Hours is the fifth and final solo studio album by Glenn Frey, released in 2012 (see 2012 in music), four years before his death. The album is very different from Frey's previous rock albums and features material from the Great American Songbook and songs in the same mood by Brian Wilson or Randy Newman. The album charted at number 116 in the U.S. and number 92 in the UK. After Hours was Frey's first new studio solo album in 20 years since 1992's Strange Weather, which was a commercial disappointment.
