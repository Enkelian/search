Kuril Islands dispute
The Kuril Islands dispute, also known in Japan as the Northern Territories dispute, is a disagreement between Japan and Russia and also some individuals of the Ainu people over sovereignty of the four southernmost Kuril Islands. The Kuril Islands is a chain of islands that stretch between the Japanese island of Hokkaido at the southern end and the Russian Kamchatka Peninsula at the northern end. The islands separate the Sea of Okhotsk from the Pacific Ocean. The four disputed islands, like other islands in the Kuril chain that are not in dispute, were annexed by the Soviet Union following the Kuril Islands landing operation at the end of World War II. The disputed islands are under Russian administration as the South Kuril District of the Sakhalin Oblast (Сахалинская область, Sakhalinskaya oblast). They are claimed by Japan, which refers to them as its Northern Territories or Southern Chishima, and considers them part of the Nemuro Subprefecture of Hokkaido Prefecture. The islands in dispute are: Iturup (Russian: Итуруп)—Etorofu Island (Japanese: 択捉島, Etorofu-tō) Kunashir (Russian: Кунашир)—Kunashiri Island (Japanese: 国後島, Kunashiri-tō) Shikotan (Russian: Шикотан)—Shikotan Island (Japanese: 色丹島, Shikotan-tō) Habomai Islands (Russian: острова Хабомаи ostrova Habomai)—Habomai Islands (Japanese: 歯舞群島, Habomai-guntō)The San Francisco Peace Treaty, signed
