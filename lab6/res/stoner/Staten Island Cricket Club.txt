Staten Island Cricket Club
The Staten Island Cricket Club (SICC) is a cricket club on Staten Island, New York that was incorporated as the Staten Island Cricket and Base Ball Club on March 22, 1872. It became the first tennis venue in the United States. History The club originally played at St. George on the “Flats” or old Camp Washington Terminal from 1866 to 1886. While not the oldest cricket club in the United States, it does claim to be the oldest cricket club in continuous use since its founding in that country. Mary Outerbridge brought tennis to the club in 1874. The first national tennis tournament in America was held at the club on September 1, 1880. 'The waterfront land was known by its Civil War use as Camp Washington. It was here that Mary Ewing Outerbridge, resident of the historic area, introduced lawn tennis in the spring of 1874. Her brother Emilius helped her to set up a net and mark out a tennis court on the grounds of Camp Washington used by the Staten Island Cricket and Baseball Club. The club had to give way to Erastus Wiman's ventures at that site and move to the former Rufus King Delafield estate
