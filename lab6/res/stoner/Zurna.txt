Zurna
The zurna (in Armenian: զուռնա, zuṙna, in Old Armenian: սուռնա suṙna, Turkish: zurna, Ottoman Turkish: زورنا zurnâ) (also called surnay, birbynė, lettish horn, zurla, surla, sornai, zournas, zurma, or zurnes), is a wind instrument played in central Eurasia, western Asia and parts of North Africa. It is usually accompanied by a davul (bass drum) in Anatolian and Assyrian folk music. Characteristics and history The zurna, like the duduk and kaval, is a woodwind instrument used to play folk music. The zurna is made from the slow-growing and hard wood of fruit trees such as plum or apricot (Prunus armeniaca). There are several different types of zurnas. The longest (and lowest pitched) is the kaba zurna, used in western Turkey and Bulgaria, the shortest (and highest pitched), which can be made of bone, is the zurna played in Messolonghi and other villages of Aetolia-Acarnania region in Greece. The zurna, a relative of oboe, is found almost everywhere where the common reed grows because it uses a short cylindrical reed that is tied to a conical brass tube on one end, flattened to a narrow slit on the other end as source of sound. It requires high pressure to give any tone
