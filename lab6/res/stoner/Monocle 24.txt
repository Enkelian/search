Monocle 24
Monocle 24 is a mainly speech-based internet radio station, broadcasting from Monocle's headquarters at Midori House in London. On weekdays, the station produces three hours of live, current affairs-based programmes. It also broadcasts weekly shows on business; culture; design; food and hospitality; print media and urbanism. Music fills the rest of the schedule, hosted by Monocle staff. Monocle 24 was launched in October 2011 and broadcasts in English, primarily from London, but with an international focus. It is a brand extension of Monocle, a magazine founded in 2007 by Canadian journalist and entrepreneur Tyler Brûlé. Around 80% of listening is via download, 20% via live streaming. In 2016, the station reported a weekly listenership of about 1 million. The Monocle Weekly Monocle 24 itself grew out of The Monocle Weekly, a podcast which first appeared on 28 December 2008. Hosted by editor Andrew Tuck and culture editor Robert Bound, it covers topics such as politics, business and culture and features interviews with big names across several disciplines, and eventually hit download figures as high as 250,000 per month. The Monocle Weekly is now a one-hour weekend show on the station and is still available as a podcast. Station history Monocle
