Isyana Dynasty
The Isyana Dynasty, rulers of the Kingdom of Medang, was a dynasty of the Hindu Medang Kingdom on the island of Java. It followed the Sanjaya Dynasty, and was established by Mpu Sindok, who moved the capital of the Mataram Kingdom from Central Java to East Java around the year 929. Coedes states, "Sindok, under his reign name Sri Isyana Vikramadharmatungadeva, was always considered the founder of Javanese power in the east of the island." Mpu Sindok's daughter and successor was Isanatungavijaya, who in turn was succeeded by her son Makutavamsavardhana, followed by Dharmawangsa. The reign of the Isyana Dynasty came to an end when the Sriwijaya empire attacked and destroyed the capital in 1016-1017.Eventually, the ruler Airlangga restored and reunited the kingdom as Kahuripan kingdom. Airlangga's heirs ruled the kingdom of Kediri and are thought to be the continuation of the Isyana Dynasty. See also Sanjaya Dynasty Kingdom of Mataram List of monarchs of Java == References ==
