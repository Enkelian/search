Omnibus Press
Omnibus Press is the world's largest specialist publisher of music-related books. It publishes around 30 new titles a year to add to a backlist of over 250 titles currently in print. History Omnibus Press was launched in 1976 as a general non-fiction publisher to complement the sheet music published and distributed by its parent company Music Sales Group. The previous year Music Sales had launched a separate company called Book Sales Ltd and the earliest Book Sales catalogue, issued in 1975, included compilations of underground comic strips, art and photography titles and one of the earliest ever books on the then newly discovered art of video. After former Melody Maker music journalist Chris Charlesworth joined as Omnibus editor in 1983, it was decided to concentrate exclusively on music books, and among its earliest acquisitions was Rock Family Trees by acclaimed music archivist Pete Frame which remain in print to this day and have been the basis of two BBC TV series. Over the succeeding decades Omnibus has published many best-selling definitive biographies on most of rock's greatest superstars. These include Morrissey & Marr: The Severed Alliance by Johnny Rogan, Dear Boy: The Life of Keith Moon by Tony Fletcher, Uptight:
