Black Antenna
Black Antenna is an upcoming American science-fiction film inspired by Alice in Chains' 2018 album Rainier Fog. Written, produced and directed by Adam Mason, starring Paul Sloan, Viktoriya Dov, Darri Ingolfsson and Eric Michael Cole. Alice in Chains are executive producers on the film along with Jason Collins. The film tells the story of extraterrestrial father and daughter, Alpha and Beta, who drive across California in silence, speaking only telepathically. The daughter seduces men and steals from them to help her father build an antenna to send a message to their people at home. At the same time, they are being tracked down by evil forces that are trying to kill them. A 10-part web-series with the same title focused on each song from Rainier Fog was released before the film.
