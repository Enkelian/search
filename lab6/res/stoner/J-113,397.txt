J-113,397
J-113,397 is an opioid drug which was the first compound found to be a highly selective antagonist for the nociceptin receptor, also known as the ORL-1 receptor. It is several hundred times selective for the ORL-1 receptor over other opioid receptors, and its effects in animals include preventing the development of tolerance to morphine, the prevention of hyperalgesia induced by intracerebroventricular administration of nociceptin (orphanin FQ), as well as the stimulation of dopamine release in the striatum, which increases the rewarding effects of cocaine, but may have clinical application in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
