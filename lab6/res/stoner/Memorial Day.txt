Memorial Day
Memorial Day (previously but now seldom called Decoration Day) is a federal holiday in the United States for remembering, honoring, and mourning the military personnel that had died while serving in the United States Armed Forces. The holiday is now observed on the last Monday of May, Memorial Day having been observed on May 30 from 1868 to 1970.Many people visit cemeteries and memorials on Memorial Day to honor and mourn those who had died in military service. Many volunteers place an American flag on each grave in national cemeteries. Memorial Day is considered the unofficial start of summer in the United States, while Labor Day marks the unofficial start of Autumn on the first Monday of September. Two other days celebrate those who have served or are serving in the U.S. military: Veterans Day, which honors those who have served in the United States Armed Forces; and Armed Forces Day, an unofficial U.S. holiday (earlier in May) for honoring those currently serving in the armed forces. Claimed origins The history of Memorial Day in the United States is complex. The U.S. Department of Veterans' Affairs recognizes that approximately 25 places claim to have originated the holiday.
