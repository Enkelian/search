Back gauge
A backgauge is a mechanical system, normally attached to a brake press. Its main function is to interface with the brake press computer numerical control (CNC), moving along several different axes in order to position a piece of metal for forming. Backgauges typically have anywhere from 1 to 6 axes of movement. Each of these individual axis is controlled by a separate electric motor. Often a brake press is sold to a customer in conjunction with a backgauge. On an extrusion saw, a backgauge is responsible for feeding material at exact amounts past a saw blade. It is responsible for the accuracy of the piece's cut length. As the name suggest gauge means measuring exact, so back gauge provide direction to the workpiece coming outward of the machine after cutting operation.
