Selda Bağcan (IPA: [ˈselda ˈbaːdʒan]; born December 14, 1948) is a Turkish folk singer-songwriter, guitarist, and music producer. Early life Selda Bağcan was born in 1948 in the western Turkish town of Muğla. Her father was a veterinarian medician of Turkish Macedonian origin and her mother was a teacher of Crimean Tatar origin. She had two older brothers named Savaş and Sezer, and a younger brother named Serter was born when Selda was two years old. The family relocated to Van shortly after Serter was born, where Selda spent most of her childhood. Her father, Selim, was a music enthusiast who played the saxophone and the flute, and he encouraged all his children to start playing instruments from a very young age. Selda herself started to play the mandolin when she was five. The family spent many evenings playing music together, under the direction of Selim. Upon Selim's unexpected death from typhoid fever in 1957, the rest of the family moved to Ankara to be close to the mother's sister. Selda continued to play the mandolin, and picked up the guitar as well, during her middle school and high school years. At first she sang English, Italian and Spanish songs
