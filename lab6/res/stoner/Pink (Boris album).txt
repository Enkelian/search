Pink (Boris album)
Pink is the tenth album by Japanese experimental music band Boris. It was originally released in 2005 through Diwphalanx Records in Japan and subsequently reissued in 2006 by American label Southern Lord Records. The album received favorable reviews, particularly for incorporating more melody into the band's abrasive sound. The original version of the album released in Japan in 2005 presents itself with a different cover (shown on the right side), track names, and length. All of these elements were subsequently modified on the first reissue of the album. The album's length was extended significantly on the LP version of the album. Additionally, a music video was shot for the title track which was limited to 100 copies on DVD. Since then, the music video has been included in the limited edition of the album Smile, also published by Southern Lord. An expanded reissue of the album using the original Japanese filled stencil-style art was announced for worldwide release by Sargent House on May 9, 2016, simultaneously debuting new track "Are You Ready" from its bonus disc. Later the same month, NPR Music hosted a stream of an additional new song from the release, "SOFUN". Sargent House streamed the bonus disc
