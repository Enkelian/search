Fallen Angel (Uriah Heep album)
Fallen Angel is the 12th studio album by British rock band Uriah Heep, released in September 1978 by Bronze Records in the UK and Chrysalis Records in the US. Fallen Angel only reached No. 186 in the US Billboard 200, but in Germany, the band were at the height of their popularity. On this album, the band moved toward an AOR sound, as opposed to the progressive rock of previous albums.The album was remastered and reissued by Castle Communications in 1997 with four bonus tracks, and again in 2004 in an expanded deluxe edition. Artwork The album was originally released in a gatefold sleeve, opening vertically rather than the customary horizontal axis. The lyrics were printed on the LP liner. The artwork was licensed from artist Chris Achilleos. Achilleos' website lists the original artwork as missing. The same artist designed the cover for the Whitesnake album Lovehunter a year later.
