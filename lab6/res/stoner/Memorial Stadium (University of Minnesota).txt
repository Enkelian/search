Memorial Stadium (University of Minnesota)
Memorial Stadium, also known as the "Brick House", was an outdoor athletic stadium in the north central United States, on the campus of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis.

After 27 seasons indoors, the Gophers returned to campus in 2009 at the new TCF Bank Stadium, a block from the site of Memorial Stadium.
