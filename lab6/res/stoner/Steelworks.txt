Steelworks
A steel mill or steelworks is an industrial plant for the manufacture of steel. It may be an integrated steel works carrying out all steps of steelmaking from smelting iron ore to rolled product, but may also describe plants where steel semi-finished casting products (blooms, ingots, slabs, billets) are made, from molten pig iron or from scrap. History Since the invention of the Bessemer process, steel mills have replaced ironworks, based on puddling or fining methods. New ways to produce steel appeared later: from scrap melted in an electric arc furnace and, more recently, from direct reduced iron processes. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries the world's largest steel mill was the Barrow Hematite Steel Company steelworks located in Barrow-in-Furness, United Kingdom. Today, the world's largest steel mill is in Gwangyang, South Korea. Integrated mill An integrated steel mill has all the functions for primary steel production: iron making (conversion of ore to liquid iron), steel making (conversion of pig iron to liquid steel), casting (solidification of the liquid steel), roughing rolling/billet rolling (reducing size of blocks) product rolling (finished shapes).The principal raw materials for an integrated mill are iron ore, limestone, and coal (or coke).
