It also shows random clips between songs and interviews. The title of the DVD stems from an incident in the film where drummer Tim Alexander successfully performs after getting food poisoning from bad fish at a restaurant. The band requested that the film be abstract, artistic, and that the songs not be shown in their entirety.
