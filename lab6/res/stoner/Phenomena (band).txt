Phenomena (band)
Phenomena is a rock music concept formed by record producer Tom Galley and his brother, Whitesnake guitarist Mel Galley. During the recording of Phenomena I, they were joined by Metalhammer founder Wilfried Rimensberger. Contributors were leading rock musicians such as Glenn Hughes, Brian May, and John Wetton, amongst others. History In a cover story run by Kerrang! magazine in 1985, Phenomena's production of rock songs based on a story line running through a whole album, attached to artworks and other multi-media aspects, was credited for the "return of the concept album" in the 1980s. Phenomena released three albums in the 1980s and early 1990s, and had a number one hit single in South America with "Did It All For Love", while the album charted in Europe, Japan, and Brazil.In 1993, Tom Galley sold his rights to the recordings and the brand concept to former Wishbone Ash member Merv Spence of Parachute Music Ltd, releasing Phenomena 3, with Spence singing and playing bass, under the name Inner Vision. In 2017, the rights to the recordings of the Phenomena trilogy of albums were obtained by Daniel Earnshaw of Explore Rights Management Ltd.
