Preparations (album)
Preparations is a studio album by Prefuse 73. It was released on Warp Records in 2007. Unlike the 2006 EP, Security Screenings, Preparations is considered the proper follow-up to the 2005 album, Surrounded by Silence. The album includes a 15-track bonus disc entitled Interregnums, which features "unheard explorations into orchestral soundtrack music", including compositions played by live musicians.
