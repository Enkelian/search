In a four-star review for The Times, Will Hodgkinson said "[Allah Las'] fourth album is a particular delight, grooving along with Portuguese country rock ("Prazer Em Te Conhecer"), offering the musical equivalent of an afternoon spent in dry, heavy heat on "Houston" and sounding as if they might have just joined a New Age cult on the celestial "Holding Pattern", adding "their jingle-jangle shimmer makes you feel so good".
