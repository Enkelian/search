Landspítali
The National University Hospital of Iceland (Icelandic: Landspítali) offers a wide range of clinical services in outpatient clinics, day patient units, inpatient wards, clinical laboratories and other divisions. Landspítalinn also operates the psychiatric hospital Kleppur. History Landspítalinn began operations on the 20th of December 1930. Ideas for a hospital that served the whole country was not new; in 1863 Jón Hjaltalín, the then Director of Health, proposed a bill that would establish such a hospital, but the bill was not voted on. During the period from 1863 - 1930 several hospitals operated in Reykjavík. The founding of Landspítali was the product of a long, hard struggle in which women were at the forefront and have ever since played a huge role in the country's hospital matters.Approximately 70% of Icelandic children are born in the hospital.
