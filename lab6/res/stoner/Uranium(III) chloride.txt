Uranium(III) chloride
Uranium(III) chloride, UCl3, is a chemical compound that contains the earth metal uranium and chlorine. UCl3 is used mostly to reprocess spent nuclear fuel. Uranium(III) chloride is synthesized in various ways from uranium(IV) chloride; however, UCl3 is less stable than UCl4. Preparation There are two ways to synthesize uranium(III) chloride. The following processes describe how to produce uranium(III) chloride. (1) In a mixture of NaCl-KCl at 670–710 °C, add uranium tetrachloride with uranium metal. 3UCl4 + U → 4UCl3(2) Heat uranium(IV) chloride in hydrogen gas. 2UCl4 + H2 → 2UCl3 + 2HCl Properties In solid uranium(III) chloride each uranium atom has nine chlorine atoms as near neighbours, at approximately the same distance, in a tricapped trigonal prismatic configuration.Uranium(III) chloride is a green crystalline solid at room temperature. UCl3 melts at 837 °C and boils at 1657 °C. Uranium(III) chloride has a density of 5500 kg/m3 or 5.500 g/cm3. Its composition by weight: Chlorine: 30.84% Uranium: 69.16%Its formal oxidative states: Chlorine: −1 Uranium: +3Uranium(III) chloride is very soluble in water and is also very hygroscopic. UCl3 is more stable in a solution of hydrochloric acid. Uses Reagent Uranium(III) chloride is used in reactions with tetrahydrofuran (THF) and sodium methylcyclopentadiene to prepare
