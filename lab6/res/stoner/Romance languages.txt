Romance languages
The Romance languages (nowadays rarely Latin languages, or Neo-Latin languages) are the modern languages that evolved from Vulgar Latin between the third and eighth centuries. They are a subgroup of the Italic languages in the Indo-European language family. Today, around 800 million people are native speakers worldwide, mainly in the Americas, Europe, and parts of Africa, as well as elsewhere. Additionally, the major Romance languages have many non-native speakers and are in widespread use as lingua francas. This is especially the case for French, which is in widespread use throughout Central and West Africa, Madagascar, Mauritius, Seychelles, Comoros, Djibouti, Lebanon and North Africa (excluding Egypt, where it is a minority language). The five most widely spoken Romance languages by number of native speakers are Spanish (480 million), Portuguese (221 million), French (77 million), Italian (65 million), and Romanian (24 million). Because of the difficulty of imposing boundaries on a continuum, various counts of the modern Romance languages are given; for example, Dalby lists 23 based on mutual intelligibility. The following, more extensive list, includes 35 current, living languages, and one extinct language, Dalmatian: Ibero-Romance: Portuguese, Galician, Mirandese, Asturian, Leonese, Spanish, Aragonese, Ladino (Judaeo-Spanish); Occitano-Romance: Catalan/Valencian, Occitan (lenga d'oc), Gascon; Gallo-Romance:
