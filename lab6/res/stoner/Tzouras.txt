Tzouras
The Tzouras (Greek: τζουράς), is a Greek stringed musical instrument related to the Bouzouki. Its name comes from the Turkish Cura. It is made in six-string and eight-string varieties. The six-string model has the same arrangement of strings tuned to the same pitches as the six-string (trichordo) bouzouki. There are three pairs of strings, tuned to D3D4–A3A3–D4D4 or D4D3–A3A3–D4D4. The strings are made of steel.The tzouras is about the same length as the bouzouki, with a similar neck and head, but with a much smaller body, giving it a distinctive tone.
