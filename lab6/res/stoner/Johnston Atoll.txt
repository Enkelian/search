Johnston Atoll
Johnston Atoll, also known as Kalama Atoll to Native Hawaiians, is an unincorporated territory of the United States currently administered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Johnston Atoll is a National Wildlife Refuge and is closed to public entry. Limited access for management needs is only by Letter of Authorization from the U.S. Air Force and Special Use Permit from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. For nearly 70 years, the atoll was under the control of the U.S. military. During that time, it was variously used as a naval refueling depot, an airbase, a nuclear and biological weapons testing site, a secret missile base, and a chemical weapon and Agent Orange storage and disposal site. These activities left the area environmentally contaminated and remediation and monitoring continue. Johnston Atoll is one of the world's most isolated atolls. It has been the most visited of the U.S. Pacific Marine Monuments as Continental Micronesia previously made stopovers at Johnston Atoll Airport. The island was annexed under the name Kalama by King Kamehameha IV of Hawai'i.
