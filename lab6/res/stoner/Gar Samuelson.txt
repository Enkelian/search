Gar Samuelson
Gary Charles "Gar" Samuelson (February 18, 1958 â€“ July 14, 1999) was an American musician best remembered for being the drummer for American thrash metal band Megadeth from 1984 to 1987, contributing to their first two albums, Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! (1985) and Peace Sells... but Who's Buying? (1986). He is considered one of the most influential drummers of thrash metal, having pioneered the incorporation of jazz fusion into the sub-genre.After meeting with Dave Mustaine and Dave Ellefson of Megadeth in 1984, he joined the band, and Poland soon followed, this being what Mustaine refers to as 'the first real line-up'. Samuelson would go on to serve as the band's drummer until 1987, appearing on the albums Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! and Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?, as well as serving through tours, until he was ultimately fired for his drug addiction.Samuelson died in Orange City, Florida, on July 14, 1999 at the age of 41; the cause of death was reportedly liver failure. The 2002 remixed and remastered version of Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! is "dedicated to the memory of Gar Samuelson". == References ==
