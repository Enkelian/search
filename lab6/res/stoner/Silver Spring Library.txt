Silver Spring Library is part of the Montgomery County Public Libraries System. It opened to the public in 1931 and is currently located at 900 Wayne Avenue in Silver Spring, Maryland. History Early locations Silver Spring Library began service in 1931 at East Silver Spring Elementary School.In 1934, the library moved to Jesup Blair Community House, also known as "The Moorings." Architect Howard Wright Cutler remodeled the building to serve as a library, and his work earned the building a nomination for placement on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. The library operated out of the Jesup Blair House for 23 years. Colesville Road location The library opened a building of its own at 8901 Colesville Road in 1957, on land donated by the Hecht Company. At this location, the library occupied a building dedicated exclusively for the library's use for the first time. Ellsworth Urban Park was created in an area covering 3.6 acres (1.5 ha) beside the library in 1979. The park has two playground areas where parents can take their children to play, and a tennis court. In 1990, Marcia Billig's sculpture Lion and the Mouse was installed in the grass of the library.A celebration
