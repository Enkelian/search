Murray Dalglish
Murray Dalglish is the original drummer for The Jesus and Mary Chain from their formation in early 1984 until November 1984 when he was replaced by Bobby Gillespie. Aged 16 when he joined the band, Dalglish played a two-piece drum kit, which he did whilst standing up; this style would later be carried on in Gillespie's playing. His drumming can be heard on the band's first single "Upside Down", along with its B-side, the Syd Barrett cover "Vegetable Man". He was reportedly kicked out of the band as his father demanded that Dalglish be given more money despite the fact that the band at the time was making little, if any, money at all.Dalglish was drummer for Baby's Got a Gun, Trixie's Big Red Motorbike, The Sux Pastels and The Decay, and as of 2014, he owns a hair salon in East Kilbride. == References ==
