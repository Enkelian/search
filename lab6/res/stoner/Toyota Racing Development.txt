Toyota Racing Development
Toyota Racing Development (also known by its abbreviation TRD) is the in-house tuning shop for all Toyota, Lexus and formerly Scion cars. TRD is responsible both for improving street cars for more performance and supporting Toyota's racing interests around the world. TRD produces various tuning products and accessories, including performance suspension components, superchargers, and wheels. TRD parts are available through Toyota dealers, and are also available as accessories on brand-new Toyotas and Scions. Performance parts for Lexus vehicles are now labeled as F-Sport and performance Lexus models are labeled F to distinguish Lexus's F division from TRD. As of June 2013 there are currently two official branches of TRD: TRD Japan (a.k.a. Toyota Technocraft) and TRD USA. Each of these branches has both a performance tuning division and a race (or competition) division. TRD Japan's Race Division concentrates on the Super GT Series (JGTC), All-Japan Formula Three Championship Series, ESSO Formula Toyota Series, and Netz Cup races (Vitz Series). TRD USA's Race Division, known as 'Toyota Racing', competes in NASCAR, NHRA Top Fuel and Funny car, IMSA GT Daytona, Pirelli World Challenge TCA, Formula Drift, TORC, USAC, and Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series. Former competitions include the Baja 1000,
