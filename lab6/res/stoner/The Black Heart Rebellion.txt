The Black Heart Rebellion
The Black Heart Rebellion are a Belgian experimental band from Ghent, formed in 2004 by vocalist Pieter Uyttenhove, guitarists Alex Maekelberg and Valentijn Goethals, bassist Emeriek Verhoye, and drummer Tim Bryon. Their initial style was rooted in hardcore punk, as manifest on their debut album Monologue (2008). After collaborating on a stage play, the band began a process of artistic reinvention which culminated in the release of Har Nevo in 2012. They experimented with atmosphere, introducing unconventional percussion patterns and new instruments such as the Indian harmonium and the bouzouki. On their third album People, When You See the Smoke, Do Not Think It Is Fields They're Burning (2015), the Black Heart Rebellion affirmed their new direction. Their latest project is a 2018 alternative soundtrack to the film A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night. During their transformative period, the band joined Church of Ra, a collaborative artist collective started by Amenra. They emphasize the integration of multiple forms, including music, performance, visual art, and ritual. Since 2008, Goethals, Bryon, and Tomas Lootens run their own record label Smoke & Dust, which has also spawned the 019 music venue/arts centre in Ghent.
