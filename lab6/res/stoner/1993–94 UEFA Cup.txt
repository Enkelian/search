Eastern Europe arrangements Political revolutions in Eastern Europe imposed some UEFA decisions. Yugoslavia was banned under UN embargo: its places were divided between former USSR, Romania, and former Czechoslovakia. An agreement between UEFA, Russia and Ukraine recognized Russia as heir of the three Soviet places, while Ukraine divided with Slovenia the heritage of disbanded East Germany. Albania was declared unsafe and it was substituted by a third club from Scotland. Poland was disqualified after its football scandal, and its places went to Hungary and Bulgaria.
