Official languages of the United Nations
The official languages of the United Nations are the six languages that are used in UN meetings, and in which all official UN documents are written. In alphabetical order, they are: Arabic (Modern Standard Arabic) Chinese (Mandarin Chinese in simplified Chinese characters. English (British English with Oxford spelling) French Russian Spanish (Castilian Spanish) Description These languages are used at meetings of various UN organs, particularly the General Assembly (Article 51 of its Rules of Procedure), the Economic and Social Council, and the Security Council (Article 41 of its Rules of Procedure). Each representative of a country may speak in any one of these six languages, or may speak in any language and provide interpretation into one of the six official languages. The UN provides simultaneous interpretation from the official language into the other five official languages, via the United Nations Interpretation Service. The six official languages are also used for the dissemination of official documents. Generally, the texts in each of the six languages are equally authoritative. The United Nations Secretariat uses two working languages: English and French.The United Nations has drawn criticism for relying too heavily on English, and not enough on the other five official languages.
