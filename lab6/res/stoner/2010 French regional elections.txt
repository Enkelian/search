2010 French regional elections
Regional elections were held in France on 14 and 21 March 2010. At stake were the presidencies of each of France's 26 r√©gions, which, though they do not have legislative autonomy, manage sizable budgets. The elections resulted in significant gains for the French Socialist Party (PS) and its allies, who went on to control 21 of the 22 regions of Metropolitan France. Situation Following the 2004 elections, which saw an historic victory of the left, largely led by the PS, only Alsace and Corsica were still run by the UMP. The left made gains in the national level in 2007 (presidential and legislative), and performed strongly in the 2008 municipal and cantonal elections. In metropolitan France, all incumbent left-wing Presidents are running for a second term in an election which generally favours popular incumbents and anti-government voting. Yet, the left is divided between the PS and Europe Ecology, which performed very strongly in the 2009 European elections. The right, principally the UMP and its allies, were victorious in the 2007 presidential and legislative elections and also in the 2009 European elections. The right is favoured by its unity, notably by its new alliances with Philippe de Villiers' Movement for France
