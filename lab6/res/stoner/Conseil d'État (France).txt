Conseil d'État (France)
In France, the Council of State (French: Conseil d'État, [kɔ̃sɛj deta]) is a body of the French national government that acts both as legal advisor of the executive branch and as the supreme court for administrative justice. Established in 1799 by Napoleon as a successor to the King's Council (Conseil du Roi), it is located in the Palais-Royal in Paris and is primarily made up of top-level legal officers. The Vice President of the Council of State ranks as the ninth most important civil servant in France. Members of the Council of State are part of a Grand Corps of the French State (grand corps de l'État). The Council of State mainly recruits from among the top-ranking students graduating from the École nationale d'administration. Composition A General Session of the Council of State is presided over by the Prime Minister or, in his absence, the Minister of Justice. However, since the real presidency of the Council is held by the Vice-President, he usually presides all but the most ceremonial assemblies. This is also done for obvious reasons pertaining to the separation of powers. Other members of the Council include, in decreasing order of importance: Department heads (président de section) Councillors
