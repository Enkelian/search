Face Your Fear
Face Your Fear is the second studio album by American singer Curtis Harding, released October 27, 2017, by Anti-. Reception Mark Deming writes, "Curtis Harding can write and sing like a soul man with a mind of his own, and here he sounds even more open, expressive, and fearless than he did on his very fine debut. Face Your Fear ups the ante for Harding, bumping him from promising newcomer to major artist, and if you like good songs played and sung with true conviction, you won't want to sleep on this."
