A Night at the Hip Hopera
A Night at the Hip Hopera is the third album by The Kleptones. It fused Queen's rock music with rap vocals and many sound bites from movies (such as Ferris Bueller's Day Off) and other sources. Unlike 1992's cancelled BASIC Queen Bootlegs album and despite its title, it is considered a bastard pop album rather than a hip-hop album. On November 8, 2004, Waxy, the main site that hosted A Night At The Hip Hopera, received a cease & desist notice from the Walt Disney Company (Hollywood Records) for illegal sampling of songs by Queen, similar to the banning of DJ Danger Mouse's The Grey Album.
