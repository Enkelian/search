Living in the Past (song)
"Living in the Past" is a song by British progressive rock group Jethro Tull. It is one of the band's best-known songs, and it is notable for being written in the unusual 54 time signature. The 54 time signature is quickly noted from the beginning rhythmic bass pattern. The single reached number 3 on the UK Singles Chart. Overview The song was originally recorded before the sessions for the 1969 album Stand Up, released in the same year as a stand-alone single to UK audiences while Jethro Tull finished its US tour. However, it became more popular after its 1972 release on the album of the same name, a compilation of the band's hits from that era. After its release on the album, it became the band's first Top 20 hit in the US, peaking at #11. The song was restored as a "bonus track" for the 2001 CD reissue of Stand Up (1969). "Living in the Past" was ranked the fifth best Jethro Tull song by Rock - Das Gesamtwerk der größten Rock-Acts im Check.
