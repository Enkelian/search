Many different versions of the single exist; the original UK release had the B-side songs "King of Rock and Roll" and a live version of "Like the Beat of a Heart". An international version, however, had live versions of the songs "Holy Diver" and "Rainbow in the Dark" on the B-side, with a different sleeve design.
