Blotted Science
Blotted Science is an instrumental progressive metal supergroup headed by Ron Jarzombek (Watchtower, Spastic Ink), bassist Alex Webster (Cannibal Corpse) and drummer Hannes Grossmann (ex-Obscura, ex-Necrophagist). They formed under the name Machinations of Dementia, but later changed their name to Blotted Science (Machinations of Dementia would be the title of their first publicly purchasable album). History In 2005 Ron Jarzombek contacted drummer Chris Adler (Lamb of God) and bassist Alex Webster (Cannibal Corpse) about a possible collaboration, with the goal of taking Jarzombek's signature left-of-center progressive metal approach into a much heavier, more extreme realm. Although the addition of a vocalist was briefly considered, the trio ultimately decided to remain an all-instrumental band. However, Adler had to bow out due to his demanding schedule with Lamb of God but would collaborate with Jarzombek on the song ‘The Near Dominance of 4 Against 5’ which appeared on Magna Carta Records’s ‘Drum Nation Vol. 3’ compilation in 2006.Adler's replacement was Derek Roddy (Hate Eternal, Nile) and, at the suggestion of Webster, the band took on the name Machinations of Dementia. Roddy left the group in August 2006. Shortly thereafter, Jarzombek was introduced to Charlie Zeleny, who would provide the missing drum tracks
