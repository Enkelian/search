Sam Boyd Stadium
Sam Boyd Stadium is a football stadium in Whitney, Nevada, United States, an unincorporated community in the Las Vegas Valley. It honors Sam Boyd (1910â€“1993), a major figure in the hotel and casino industry in Las Vegas. The stadium consists of an uncovered horseshoe-shaped single-decked bowl, with temporary seating occasionally erected in the open north end zone. The field has a conventional north-south orientation and is at an elevation of 1,600 feet (490 m) above sea level. The stadium was the home of the UNLV Rebels football team from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas from 1971 until 2019, and the annual Las Vegas Bowl in December from 1992 until 2019. It was also used for high school football championship games and at times regular-season high school games for Bishop Gorman High School. A long time stop on the AMA Supercross Championship beginning in 1990, the final race of the season was located at the stadium every year until the upcoming 2020 season when the stadium was moved to the second to last race. From 2010 to 2019, it hosted the USA Sevens leg of the annual World Rugby Sevens Series in the sevens version of rugby union.Several teams called
