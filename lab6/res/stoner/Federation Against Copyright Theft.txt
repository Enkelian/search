Federation Against Copyright Theft
The Federation Against Copyright Theft (informally FACT) is the UK's leading trade organisation established to protect and represent the interests of its members' intellectual property (IP). Established in 1983, FACT works closely with statutory law enforcement agencies to combat all forms of copyright infringement and members include global and UK film distributors, TV broadcasters and sport rights owners. Its sister-organisation the Australian Screen Association has a similar focus in the Oceania Region, taking over the responsibilities of the Australian Film and Video Security Office in the early 2000s. History In 2007, FACT reported seizing over 2.8m pirate DVDs and states it has "enhanced its enforcement capabilities against those involved in the manufacture, distribution and sale of copyright material both online and in hard copy format".Also in 2007, FACT, in collaboration with UK police, took down well known hot-linking site Tv-links.co.uk. FACT makes the claim that the 26-year-old man from Cheltenham was arrested in connection with offences relating to the facilitation of copyright infringement on the internet whereas the arrest was over a matter of possible trademark infringement. While arrested under Section 92 of the Trade Marks Act 1994 he has now been released 'pending further investigation' with no charges filed
