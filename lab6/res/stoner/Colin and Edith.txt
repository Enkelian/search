Colin and Edith
Colin and Edith was a radio show broadcast on BBC Radio 1 until August 2006, hosted by radio personalities Edith Bowman and Colin Murray. The show began in 2003 and was scheduled on the station's weekend morning shift. In April 2004, following the departure of Mark and Lard, the show was rescheduled to the weekday afternoon slot, from 13:00 to 16:00. Their last show together was part of Radio 1's Six Weeks of Summer on 12 August 2006. Plans to broadcast the show live from Ibiza were abandoned after the 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot.
