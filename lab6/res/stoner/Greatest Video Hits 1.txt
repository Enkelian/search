Greatest Video Hits 1
Greatest Video Hits 1 was the first Queen video collection on DVD. Most of the content was released previously on VHS and the long defunct CED Videodisc format as Greatest Flix in 1981. It was released in October 2002, and included video hits of the band between 1973 and 1981. The DVD peaked at number one in UK, with sales of more than 90,000 copies. It was also the best selling DVD of the year in 2002. It was also number one in USA (Platinum), Germany (Gold), Spain and other countries. Sales were certified quadruple Platinum in Australia, triple Platinum in Canada, and Platinum in Poland. Most music videos on the DVD have been converted to 16:9 widescreen. This was achieved by cropping the top and bottom of the original 4:3 frame. This caused some controversy within Queen's fanbase.
