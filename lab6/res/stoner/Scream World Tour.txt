Scream World Tour
The Scream World Tour was a concert tour by English born heavy metal musician Ozzy Osbourne in support of tenth studio album, Scream, which was released in June 2010. The tour officially kicked off in June 2010 with a tour of Europe, following two promotional dates in Hollywood in the United States earlier in the month. These shows were the first in which new guitarist Gus G. and drummer Tommy Clufetos were officially a part of the live band. The European leg began in Birmingham, England and wrapped up on the 9th of July in Turku, Finland. The main purpose of the leg was to promote Osbourne's newly released album, Scream. In August 2010, Osbourne and his touring band performed six dates for the annual Ozzfest as well as a pre-festival appearance at the Buffalo Chip festival in Sturgis, South Dakota. The event also hosted Mötley Crüe as a co-headliner marking the first time they have toured with Osbourne since 1984. The first date of the United States Ozzfest began in San Bernardino, California and eventually culminated in Boston, Massachusetts. After the culmination of the Ozzfest in the United States, Osbourne embarked on a second European leg beginning on August
