Lock Up the Wolves
Lock Up the Wolves is the fifth studio album by the American heavy metal band Dio, released on May 15, 1990. It displayed a complete change of musician line-up over the previous Dream Evil album, including eighteen-year-old guitarist Rowan Robertson, and Simon Wright on drums who had played with AC/DC from 1983-89. The song "Evil on Queen Street" takes its title from a deli in Toronto which had a sandwich with that name – per Dio on Much Music in 1990. Guitarist Rowan Robertson states that two more songs were written and demoed for the album but left off at the decision of Wendy Dio: "‘Hell wouldn’t take her’ and ‘The River Between Us".
