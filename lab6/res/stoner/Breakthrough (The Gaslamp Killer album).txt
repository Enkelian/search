Background and recording While The Gaslamp Killer's earlier work was characterized by a heavy use of samples, on Breakthrough he chose to work with musicians to recreate the "vibe" of particular tracks. Comparing his method to the way that Led Zeppelin and The Rolling Stones used blues music, he said, "I'm just trying to get ideas from world music, different rock 'n' roll records, library records, psychedelic shit, jazz â€“ getting ideas from other records and trying to recreate them with musicians." Critical reception At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, Breakthrough received an average score of 66% based on 18 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews".
