1945 Cleveland Rams season
The 1945 Cleveland Rams season was the team's eighth year with the National Football League and the ninth and final season in Cleveland. Led by the brother tandem of head coach Adam Walsh and general manager Chile Walsh, and helmed by future Hall of Fame quarterback Bob Waterfield, the Rams franchise finished 9-1 before winning its first NFL Championship by defeating the Washington Redskins, 15-14, at Cleveland Stadium. Other stars on the team included receiver Jim Benton and back Jim Gillette, who gained more than 100 yards in the title game. One month after winning the championship, team owner Dan Reeves, frustrated by continuing financial losses and anxious of the startup in the coming year of the All-America Football Conference Cleveland Browns, moved the team to Los Angeles, marking the first and still only time an NFL champion has played the following season in another city.
