Jackson Institute for Global Affairs
The Jackson Institute for Global Affairs promotes education and scholarship on global affairs at Yale University. Based in New Haven, Connecticut, the institute’s mission is to inspire and prepare Yale students for global leadership and service. The institute, which was established in 2010, is home to a master’s program in global affairs, a master of advanced study in global affairs and an undergraduate major in global affairs. The master’s program in global affairs was called international relations prior to its redesign and name change in 2013. The Jackson Institute, led by director James A. Levinsohn, also includes the undergraduate Global Health Studies program, the Kerry Initiative, the Yale World Fellows program and the Johnson Center for the Study of American Diplomacy. Offices The Jackson Institute for Global Affairs is located in Horchow Hall on New Haven's historic Hillhouse Avenue. The building formerly housed the Yale School of Management. Foundation In April 2009, Yale announced it had received a $50 million gift to create the Jackson Institute for Global Affairs. In the fall of 2010, the university officially opened the institute. The donation came from ex-pharmaceutical businessman and philanthropist John Jackson, a 1967 graduate of Yale College, and his wife Susan.
