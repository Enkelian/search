Skyscraper (band)
Skyscraper was a UK-based rock band formed during 1992. The original line-up consisted of Vic Kemlicz (guitar/vocals), previously of the Camden band Milk, ex-Swervedriver bass guitarist Adi Vines and drummer Oliver Grasset, formerly of the band Pitchfork Skyscraper. From time to time Skyscraper also employed the services of guitarist Fuzz (formerly of Silverfish) to fill out the live sound until the arrival of guitarist Adam Lamprell, previously from the London band The Scissormen, in 1995. Drummer Craig Coggle joined the band in 1996. Although the band's music was superficially similar to the grunge style that was popular at the time, it contained a melodic inventiveness and a characteristically unusual guitar style which brought the band swift attention. Despite being favourites of the UK rock press, the band split after the recording of their second album, Shooters, in 1997.
