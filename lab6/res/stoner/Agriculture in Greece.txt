Agriculture in Greece
Agriculture in Greece is based on small, family-owned dispersed units, while the extent of cooperative organization stays at low comparative levels, against all efforts that have been taken in the last 30 years, mainly under European Union supervision. Greek agriculture employs 528,000 farmers, 12% of the total labor force. It only produces 3.6% of the national GDP (about $16 billion annually). Many of the country's immigrants are employed in the agricultural sector of the economy, as well as construction and public works. Greece produces a wide variety of crops and livestock products. Fisheries are also playing an important role while forestry plays a secondary role. Current Currently, Greek agriculture is heavily subsidized by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), with controversial results. Certain deductions of subsidies are planned within the next decade.
