Recreation Park (Pittsburgh)
Recreation Park was a sporting grounds and stadium located in what is today Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The stadium existed during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. During the park's heyday, the location was considered to be within Allegheny City, but in 1907, the entire municipality was annexed by its larger neighbor and eventually became Pittsburgh's North Side. The field was the first National League home for the Pittsburgh Pirates (at the time referred to as the Alleghenys) of Major League Baseball. It also hosted many football games of the University of Pittsburgh (at the time referred to as the Western University of Pennsylvania). In November 1892, the park was the location of the first known American football game that included a professional player. The park left a scant pictorial record. Only one known photograph, taken from a very distant vantage point, shows the grounds in its longtime baseball configuration. It was discovered in 2015 in a time capsule left by scientific instrument maker John Brashear. A much-altered facility appears in later photos, including several newspaper shots of football games. History Opened in 1865 as a skating center, the park was adapted for baseball use in 1867. Known prior to 1885
