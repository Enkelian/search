Abbadid dynasty
The Abbadid dynasty or Abbadids (Arabic: بنو عباد‎, romanized: Banū ʿAbbād) was an Arab Muslim dynasty which arose in al-Andalus on the downfall of the Caliphate of Cordoba (756–1031). After the collapse, there were multiple small Muslim states called taifas, each ruled by a different family or tribe: the Hammudids, the Zayrids, the Jahwarids, the Dhul-Nunids, the Amirids, the Tojibids, and the Hudids. Of all of these small groups, the Abbadid were the strongest and before long absorbed most of the others. Abbadid rule lasted from about 1023 until 1091, but during the short period of its existence it exhibited singular energy and typified its time. Abu al-Qasim Muhammad ibn Abbad (ruled 1023–1042) Abu al-Qasim Muhammad ibn Abbad (r. 1023–1042), the qadi of Seville, founded the house in 1023.The Abbadids had not previously played a major role in history, though they were of noble pedigree, hailing from the Lakhmids, the historical kings of al-Hira in south-central Iraq. The branch that resulted in the Abbadids settled in Homs in Syria, and was among the first Muslim families to settle in al-Andalus after the Muslim conquest of Hispania. Abu al-Qasim's father, Isma'il ibn Abbad (died 1023) was named as qadi of Sevilla
