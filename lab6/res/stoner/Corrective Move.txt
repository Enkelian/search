Corrective Move
The Corrective Move' (Arabic: الحركة التصحيحية‎), officially referred to as the "Glorious Corrective Move" and often referred to as the "Corrective Step", was the takeover of the National Liberation Front by Marxist faction led by Abdel Fattah Ismail and Salim Rubai, in an internal bloodless coup on 22 June 1969 that overthrew the moderate President Qahtan al-Shaabi. The leftist takeover later led to the creation of the Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP), and South Yemen's transformation into a socialist state. == References ==
