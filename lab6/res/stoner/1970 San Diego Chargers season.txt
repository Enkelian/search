1970 San Diego Chargers season
The 1970 San Diego Chargers season was the franchise's first season in the National Football League (NFL) (As a result of the NFL-AFL Merger, where the league was broken into two Conferences, with the AFL teams moved into the American Football Conference), and its 11th overall. San Diego's 5-6-3 record was the first of seven consecutive losing seasons for the franchise. The 1970 Chargers are the last NFL team to record three ties in a single season, a record which will likely stand, as the NFL adopted overtime for regular season games in 1974.
