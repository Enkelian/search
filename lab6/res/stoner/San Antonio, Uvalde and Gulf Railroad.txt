San Antonio, Uvalde and Gulf Railroad
The San Antonio, Uvalde and Gulf Railroad was a South Texas railroad company in the first half of the 20th century that linked San Antonio with Corpus Christi, Texas. Chartered in 1909 as the Crystal City and Uvalde Railroad, it was renamed in 1912. Because of its unusual abbreviation, the SAU&G, the railroad was for years thereafter popularly called "The Sausage". Origin From 1909 to 1911, Crystal City and Uvalde laid 120 miles (190 km) of track between Uvalde, a city southwest of San Antonio, and Carrizo Springs, the county seat of Dimmit County, and also from Crystal City in Zavala County, a spinach-growing area, to rural Fowlerton near Cotulla in La Salle County. With capital of $230,000, the SAU&G proved convenient for the shipping needs of area farmers and ranchers.In 1912, the SAU&G completed a 78-mile (126 km) link from San Antonio to Fowlerton through Pleasanton in Atascosa County, where the company headquarters was moved in 1913 from the previous location in Crystal City. The 117 miles (188 km) between Pleasanton and Corpus Christi opened at intervals during 1913 and 1914, but the company went into receivership on August 14, 1914. History In 1916, the SAU&G owned 18 locomotives
