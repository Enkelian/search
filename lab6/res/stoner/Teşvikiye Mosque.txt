Teşvikiye Mosque
The Teşvikiye Mosque is a neo-baroque structure located in the Teşvikiye neighbourhood of Şişli district in Istanbul, Turkey. History It was originally commissioned in 1794 by Sultan Selim III, but most of the current mosque that stands today was completed in 1854 during the reign of Sultan Abdülmecit I. It was during this time that several well-known structures in Istanbul were being built or renovated, including Ortaköy Mosque and Dolmabahçe Palace, in styles imported from Europe. It is the front of the mosque, constructed during a renovation in the late 19th century, that gives it a unique appearance, with huge white columns. It has become a sort of stand-out symbol in the upscale, bustling quarter of Nişantaşı. It is also often used as the starting point of funerals for famous and public figures. Orhan Pamuk's childhood When he was a child, Orhan Pamuk was taken here by his family's housekeeper.
