First English Civil War
The 1642 to 1646 First English Civil War is one of a series of connected conflicts in the kingdoms of England, incorporating Wales, Scotland, and Ireland.

Modern estimates are that between 1638 to 1651, Britain suffered a total of 250,000 war-related deaths, equivalent to 5% of the population, versus 2.6% in 1914 to 1918. Ireland incurred roughly the same number, or 15-20% of the pre-1641 population.English Royalists backed Charles I, with limited help from Irish and Scots Royalists.
