The Dawn of the Black Hearts is a bootleg live album by the Norwegian black metal band Mayhem. The title originates from lyrics Fenriz of Darkthrone wrote for the band; the lyrics sheet can be found in the 2009 limited edition EP, Life Eternal. Despite being a bootleg, the album is sometimes listed as one of the band's main albums, mainly due to the notoriety regarding the artwork. Cover The album is infamous for bearing a controversial photograph of Mayhem's singer, Dead (Per Yngve Ohlin), after his suicide in April 1991. The photograph was taken by Mayhem's guitarist, Euronymous (Ã˜ystein Aarseth), when he discovered the body.

Euronymous took bits of Dead's skull and made them into necklaces for members of the black metal scene, including the band's drummer Hellhammer. In disgust with Euronymous' actions, the bass player Necrobutcher left the band and was replaced by Burzum's Varg Vikernes who murdered Euronymous two years later.
