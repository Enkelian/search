VietJet Air
VietJet Aviation Joint Stock Company (Vietnamese: Công ty Cổ phần Hàng không VietJet), trading as VietJet Air or Vietjet, is an international low-cost airline from Vietnam. It was the first privately owned new-age airline to be established in Vietnam, being granted its initial approval to operate by the Vietnamese Minister of Finance in November 2007. As of its launch in December 2011, it became the second private airline to offer domestic service in Vietnam, as well as the fifth airline overall to offer civil domestic flights. VietJet Air is owned by Sovico Holdings, HDBank, other organisational investors and individual stakeholders. The carrier's launch was beset by long delays attributed to various causes, such as a global economic slowdown and regulatory issues. Although budget carrier AirAsia announced in February 2010 that it planned to purchase a 30% stake in the airline through a joint venture agreement, the carrier later rescinded its plans, citing "a failure to obtain Vietnamese regulatory approvals". Despite the setbacks, VietJet Air's first flight was operated on 25 December 2011, flying from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi. The carrier carried its 10 millionth passenger in December 2014, and the 25 millionth passenger in December 2015. History Foundation
