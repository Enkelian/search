American Association of Snowboard Instructors
The Professional Ski Instructors of America and American Association of Snowboard Instructors (PSIA-AASI) is the world’s largest nonprofit education association dedicated to promoting the sports of skiing and snowboarding through instruction. With more than 32,500 members instructing at 300 member ski and snowboard schools, PSIA-AASI establishes certification standards for snowsports instructors and develops education materials to be used as the core components of instructor training. PSIA-AASI members spend more time with the skiing and snowboarding public than any other ski area employee. PSIA-AASI supports area management through research and development of instructional programs in alpine skiing, snowboarding, telemark skiing, cross-country skiing, and para-alpine skiing. The association also develops educational materials and programs to serve specific ski and snowboard demographics, such as children’s and freestyle specializations. PSIA-AASI’s national office is in Lakewood, Colorado, and there are eight regional divisions across the country: Central, Eastern, Intermountain, Northern Intermountain, Northern Rocky Mountain, Northwest, Rocky Mountain, and Western. The divisions provide on-the-ground services to the members in their specific part of the country and support their local members through education, certification, and PSIA-AASI membership services. In addition, PSIA-AASI represents the United States to the rest of the world through the International Ski Instructors Association.
