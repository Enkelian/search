Judas Rising
"Judas Rising" is a song by heavy metal band Judas Priest. It is the opening track on the band's 2005 album Angel of Retribution. The song is about the Judas Priest Messiah on the cover of the albums Sad Wings of Destiny, Painkiller and Angel of Retribution.. It was also included on the album's The Essential Judas Priest and A Touch of Evil: Live. According to former guitarist K.K. Downing the origins of the song existed already in the 80's but were first finished for the Angel of Retribution album.According to Rob Halford: 'Judas Rising' is not really a statement of intent, no. I just like that expression. But it could be taken in both contexts. To me it's about the angel coming out of that Sad Wings of Destiny artwork environment, where it was a very despondent, very doomy type of oppressive world, and now suddenly it's back in its full majesty and glory and it's overcome the odds and it's full of optimism and energy. It was well received by fans, and has been regularly played live since the album's release. Personnel Rob Halford: Vocals K. K.
