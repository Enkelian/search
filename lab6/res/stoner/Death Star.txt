Both versions of these moon-sized fortresses are designed for massive power-projection capabilities, each capable of destroying an entire planet with a 6.2x1032 J/s power output blast from their superlasers. Origin and design Although details, such as the superlaser's location, shifted between different concept models during production of Star Wars, the notion of the Death Star being a large, spherical space station over 100 kilometers in diameter was consistent in all of them. George Lucas gave the original task of designing a "Death Star" to concept artist and spaceship modeler Colin Cantwell, who had collaborated with Stanley Kubrick on the 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey.
