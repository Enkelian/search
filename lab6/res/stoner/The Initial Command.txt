The Initial Command
The Initial Command is the first full-length studio album released by Canadian industrial band Front Line Assembly, as their first two releases, Nerve War and Total Terror, were demo tapes. The music was created mostly by Bill Leeb with some help from Michael Balch. Since the 1987 release of The Initial Command, the album has been re-issued twice. The first release, in 1992, contained no changes. The second release, in 1997, contained two new tracks and new cover art. The 1997 re-release incorrectly listed the second track "Core" as "Intelligence Dream" while the liner notes have the correct title. "Complexity" and "Core" appear to be new songs at the time of release. Track listing All tracks are written by Bill Leeb, except where noted.
