Meibomian gland
Meibomian glands (often written with a small "m" and also called tarsal glands) are holocrine type exocrine glands, along the rims of the eyelid inside the tarsal plate. They produce meibum, an oily substance that prevents evaporation of the eye's tear film. Meibum prevents tears spilling onto the cheek, trapping the tears between the oiled edge and the eyeball, and making the closed lids airtight. There are about 50 glands on the upper eyelid and 25 glands on the lower eyelid.Dysfunctional meibomian glands often cause dry eyes, one of the more common eye conditions. They may also contribute to blepharitis. The glands are named after Heinrich Meibom (1638â€“1700), a German physician, who first described them. Function Meibum Lipids Lipids are the major components of meibum (also known as "meibomian gland secretions"). The term "meibum" was originally introduced by Nicolaides et al. in 1981.The biochemical composition of meibum is extremely complex and very different from that of sebum. Lipids are universally recognized as major components of human and animal meibum. Recently, an update on the composition of human meibum and on the structures of various positively identified meibomian lipids was published.Currently, the most sensitive and informative approach to lipidomic analysis of
