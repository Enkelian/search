He is best known as the frontman and principal songwriter of the rock band Arctic Monkeys, with whom he has released six albums.

Their debut album, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not (2006), became the fastest-selling debut album in British history and was ranked at No. 30 on Rolling Stone's list of the greatest debut albums of all time. The band's subsequent studio albums, Favourite Worst Nightmare (2007), Humbug (2009), Suck It and See (2011), AM (2013) and Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino (2018), have experimented with desert rock, indie pop, R&B, and lounge music. Arctic Monkeys headlined Glastonbury Festival in both 2007 and 2013, and performed during the 2012 London Summer Olympics opening ceremony. Turner and Miles Kane have released two orchestral pop albums – The Age Of The Understatement (2008) and Everything You've Come To Expect (2016) – as the co-frontmen of The Last Shadow Puppets.
