Stade Pershing
Stade Pershing (French pronunciation: ​[stad pɛʁʃiŋ]) was a multi-purpose stadium in the Bois de Vincennes in Paris, France. It was used mostly for football matches and hosted the final of the Coupe de France on four occasions. It hosted the Inter-Allied Games in 1919 and the first Women's World Games in 1922. It also hosted some of the football matches during the 1924 Summer Olympics. The stadium was able to hold 29,000 spectators at its height; it opened in 1919 and closed in 1960. Its area currently hosts baseball games. Construction of the stadium was originally contracted to a French firm. However, labour disputes stopped all work. At this time, the engineers of the United States Army intervened and completed construction. It hosted the Inter-Allied Games, and then was presented as a gift from the US to France after the games concluded. An exhibition match at Stade Pershing between the England and Australian national rugby league football teams in December 1933 (won 63–13 by the Australians) as part of the Australian teams 1933–34 Kangaroo Tour, inspired the beginnings of rugby league in France.
