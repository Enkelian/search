Rockman (amplifier)
The Rockman is a headphone guitar amplifier. The original Rockman was developed and built by Scholz Research & Development, Inc., a company founded by Tom Scholz, who is also the founder and a key member of the rock band Boston. Scholz Research & Development was sold to Dunlop Manufacturing, Inc. in 1995. Dunlop continues to manufacture the Rockman Ace, and Tom Scholz's signature still appears on the unit. Features The Rockman offers four guitar effects: compression, distortion, stereo chorus and echo. It has a stereo input jack so that a guitarist can play along to an audio program coming from another sound source. The distortion and clean settings both sound very similar to the "Boston guitar sound" which was previously achieved by Scholz only through endless experimentation with amps, microphones, equalizers and other gear. The high signal-to-noise ratio means it can be used in professional studios. Third-party companies manufactured solutions to integrate the Rockman into rack setups for the stage and studio use as well. Though the Rockman lacks tone controls, tone can be adjusted in other ways: via the guitar, the mixing board or the amplifier (if the Rockman is being used as a pre-amp). Users Among the many
