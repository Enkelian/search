Manhattans
Manhattoe/Manhattoes is a term describing a place and, mistakenly, a people. The place was the very southern tip of Manhattan island in the time of the Dutch Colonization of what became New Amsterdam there. The people were a band of the Wappinger native to southwest Westchester County known as the Weckquaesgeek, who controlled the upper three-quarters of the island as a hunting grounds. As was common practice early in the days of European settlement of North America, a people came to be associated with a place, with its name displacing theirs among the settlers and those associated with them, such as explorers, mapmakers, trading company superiors who sponsored many of the early settlements, and officials in the settlers' mother country in Europe. Because of this early conflation there is enduring confusion over whether "Manhattoe/Manhattoes" were a people or a place. There is certainty it was a place, at the very tip of Manhattan Island, so referred to by the Dutch, who evidently inherited the Native American name for the spot they chose to place their settlement (rather than named it after a people already living there, as the island was not permanently inhabited at the time of their 1609 arrival
