Killer (Belgian band)
Killer is a Belgian heavy metal band founded in 1980. The lead guitarist is Paul Shorty Van Camp. History Killer was founded in 1980 by Paul "Shorty" Van Camp (lead guitar and lead vocals) and "Fat Leo" (drums), who had just split up their previous band, Mothers of Track. After a few auditions "Spooky" (bass guitar and lead vocals) joined the band. They decided to stay a power trio and started working on the songs. After four months, their first record, Ready for Hell, was recorded and released by major company WEA (Warner Bros). After this release Killer knew a very fast evolution and became a well respected and major band all over Europe and even abroad. Killer was managed and advised by Alfie Falkenbach, Leo Felsenstein and Stonne Holmgren, who later founded Mausoleum, one of the first independent heavy metal labels. Killer was the first Belgian metal band inspired by the success of the NWOBHM bands such as Saxon, Iron Maiden, and Def Leppard. Due to the trio formula, the rough voices, speedy uptempos, and double bass drums, Killer was always compared with Motorhead. This was more of an honour than an insult. Killer and Motorhead were speedy bands
