It is now a member of both the International Air Transport Association and the African Airlines Association. History DTA – Divisão dos Transportes Aéreos (1938–1973) The origins of the carrier can be traced back to 1937, when the president of Portugal Óscar Carmona commended Joaquim de Almedia Baltazar to create an airline in Angola. In September 1938, DTA – Divisão dos Transportes Aéreos was formed as a division of the Administration of Railways, Harbours, and Air Transport of Portuguese West Africa. It was owned and run by the government, which authorised the acquisition of three Dragons and two Junkers Ju 52s, although the latter two aircraft were not delivered due to the outbreak of the Second World War. Operations began on 17 July 1940,
