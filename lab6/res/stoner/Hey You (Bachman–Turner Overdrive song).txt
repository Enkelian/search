It was the first and more successful of two singles issued from the LP, the second being "Quick Change Artist", which was released in Canada only. "Hey You" was the second BTO single to hit number 1 on the Canadian RPM chart, following "You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet". It held the top position on the RPM chart for two weeks in June 1975. The song peaked at number 21 on the US Billboard Hot 100 on July 5, 1975.Rumors circulated that Randy Bachman directed the lyrics of "Hey You" at former bandmate Burton Cummings, who had publicly stated that Bachman would never make it in the music business again following his departure from The Guess Who. Randy confirmed the rumors in interviews years later, stating: "I deserved to gloat a bit after all the mud Burton had slung at me." Charts == References ==
