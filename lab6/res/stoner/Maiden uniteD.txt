About In 2006, Joey Bruers was asked to perform a tribute at a convention for the Dutch Iron Maiden fan club in Dynamo, Eindhoven. Together with several musicians he played a set of acoustic Iron Maiden songs. Steve Harris attended the convention and gave the band ‘two thumbs up’.There were a few more shows like this and then he started to write new acoustic arrangements for a series of songs with Ruud Jolie (Within Temptation). They began to search for musicians to record these songs and on 9 December 2010 their first album was released; Mind the Acoustic Pieces, an all-acoustic reinterpretation of Iron Maiden’s classic album Piece of Mind. The album was supported by the "Pieces Over Europe Tour" (December 2010 - April 2011). Maiden uniteD played at the 2011 Wacken Open Air festival in Germany and they played at the 2011 Download festival in the UK.Their second album 'Across The Seventh Sea' was released in September 2012 and followed by a European tour in November and December.
