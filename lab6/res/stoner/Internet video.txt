Internet video
Internet video (online video / cloud-based video) is the general field that deals with the transmission of video over the Internet. Internet video exists in several formats, the most notable being MPEG-4 AVC, AVCHD, FLV, and MP4. There are several online video hosting services, including YouTube, as well as Vimeo, Twitch, and Youku. In recent years, the platform of internet video has been used to stream live events. As a result of the popularity of online video, notable events like the 2012 U.S. presidential debates have been streamed live on the internet. Additionally, internet video has played an important role in the music industry as a medium to watch music videos and gain popularity for songs. Video file formats Practical online video streaming was only made possible with advances in data compression, due to the impractically high bandwidth requirements of uncompressed video. Raw digital video requires a bandwidth of 168 Mbit/s for SD video, and over 1 Gbit/s for FHD video.The most important compression technique that enabled practical video streaming is the discrete cosine transform (DCT), a form of lossy compression first proposed in 1972 by Nasir Ahmed, who then developed the algorithm with T. Natarajan and K. R. Rao
