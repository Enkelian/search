Copper(II) oxide
Copper(II) oxide or cupric oxide is the inorganic compound with the formula CuO. A black solid, it is one of the two stable oxides of copper, the other being Cu2O or cuprous oxide. As a mineral, it is known as tenorite. It is a product of copper mining and the precursor to many other copper-containing products and chemical compounds. Production It is produced on a large scale by pyrometallurgy, as one stage in extracting copper from its ores. The ores are treated with an aqueous mixture of ammonium carbonate, ammonia, and oxygen to give copper(I) and copper(II) ammine complexes, which are extracted from the solids. These complexes are decomposed with steam to give CuO. It can be formed by heating copper in air at around 300–800°C: 2 Cu + O2 → 2 CuOFor laboratory uses, pure copper(II) oxide is better prepared by heating copper(II) nitrate, copper(II) hydroxide, or basic copper(II) carbonate: 2 Cu(NO3)2(s) → 2 CuO(s) + 4 NO2(g) + O2(g) (180°C) CuCO3(s) → CuO(s) + CO2(g) 2 Cu(OH)2(s) → 2 CuO(s) + 2 H2O(l) + O2(g) Reactions Copper(II) oxide dissolves in mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid or nitric acid to give the corresponding copper(II) salts: CuO
