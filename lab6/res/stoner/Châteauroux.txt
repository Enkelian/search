Châteauroux
Châteauroux (French pronunciation: [ʃatoʁu] (listen)) is the capital of the Indre department in central France and the second-largest town in the province of Berry, after Bourges. Its residents are called Castelroussins. Climate Châteauroux temperatures range from an average January low of 0.8 °C (33 °F) to an average August high of 25.1 °C (77 °F). History The old town, close to the river, forms a nucleus around which a newer and more extensive quarter, bordered by boulevards, has grown up; the suburbs of St. Christophe and Déols lie on the right bank of the Indre. The castle from which the city takes its name was built in the latter part of the 10th century by Raoul, prince of Déols. From 920 to 1008, the Norman raids forced the monks of the abbey of Saint-Gildas-de-Rhuys, founded in Brittany by Saint Gildas, to bring his relics to the abbey of Saint-Gildas of Châteauroux that they founded under the protection of the prince Ebbes of Déols, father of Raoul. During the Middle Ages it was the seat of a seigniory, which passed to the Chauvigny from 1207 to 1473 and was raised to the rank of countship in 1497 for Jean V d'Aumont.
