Health care reform debate in the United States
The healthcare reform debate in the United States has been a political issue focusing upon increasing medical coverage, decreasing costs, insurance reform, and the philosophy of its provision, funding, and government involvement. Details During the presidency of Barack Obama, who campaigned heavily on accomplishing health care reform, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) was enacted in March 2010. In the next administration, President Trump said the healthcare system should work based on free market principles. He endorsed a seven-point plan for healthcare reform: repeal Obamacare reduce barriers to the interstate sale of health insurance institute a full tax deduction for insurance premium payments for individuals make Health Saving Accounts inheritable require price transparency block-grant Medicaid to the states allow for more overseas drug providers through lowered regulatory barriersHe also suggested that enforcing immigration laws could reduce healthcare costs.The Trump administration made efforts to repeal the ACA and replace it with a different healthcare policy (known as a "repeal and replace" approach), but it never succeeded in doing so through Congress. Next, the administration joined a lawsuit seeking to overturn the ACA, and the Supreme Court agreed at the beginning of March 2020 that it would hear the case.
