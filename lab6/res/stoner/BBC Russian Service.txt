BBC Russian Service
BBC News Russian (Russian: BBC News Ру́сская слу́жба) - formerly BBC Russian Service (Russian: Ру́сская слу́жба Би-би-си́) - is part of the BBC World Service's foreign language output, one of nearly 40 languages it provides. History The BBC Russian Service began broadcasting on 26 March 1946. However, during World War II there were sporadic broadcasts to the Soviet Union in Russian only. Most of these broadcasts were after 1942. These were mainly short news bulletins or announcements relating to UK Foreign Office policy in Russian from 1943 onwards but often weeks or months apart. In the Cold War-era broadcasts were severely jammed. Despite this, it tried to bring to listeners in Soviet Union information they were deprived of, including works of writers and dissidents who could not publish their work at home, such as Alexander Solzhenitsyn. Jamming finally stopped in the late 1980s, as perestroika took hold. Broadcasting The BBC Russian Service has moved all its operation to the Internet, halting radio broadcasting after 65 years on air. Before the final decision to concentrate on online production the Russian Service radio was available only on AM. The BBC Russian Service partnered with Bol'shoe Radio (Russian: Большое радио), an FM broadcaster
