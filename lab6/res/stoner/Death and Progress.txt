Death and Progress
Death and Progress is the fourth studio album released by the British heavy metal band Diamond Head in 1993, through Castle Music Ltd. This was Diamond Head's first album since Canterbury, released 10 years earlier. It was co-produced, engineered and mixed by Andrew Scarth, who had previously worked for bands such as Bad Company and Foreigner. The album had a much cleaner and more polished sound than their previous three albums and featured two special guests, Tony Iommi, of Black Sabbath, and Dave Mustaine, of Megadeth, the latter also enlisting the help of his own producer Max Norman.Some of the tracks off this album were released on an EP in 1992 entitled Rising Up, although this EP was only sold in specialist music stores.
