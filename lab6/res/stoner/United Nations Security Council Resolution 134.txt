United Nations Security Council Resolution 134
United Nations Security Council Resolution 134, adopted on April 1, 1960, was passed after a complaint by twenty-nine Member States regarding "the situation arising out of the large-scale killings of unarmed and peaceful demonstrators against racial discrimination and segregation in the Union of South Africa". The Council recognized that the situation was brought about by the policies of the government of the Union of South Africa and that if these policies continued they could endanger international peace and security. The resolution voiced the Council's anger at the policies and actions of the Government, offered their sympathies to the families of the victims, called upon the Government to initiate measures aimed at bringing about racial harmony based on equality and called upon it to abandon apartheid. The Council then requested that the Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld consult with the government of the Union of South Africa to make arrangements to help uphold the principles of the Charter and to report to the Council whenever necessary and appropriate. The resolution was adopted with nine votes; France and the United Kingdom abstained.
