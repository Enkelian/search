Gerard Autet
Gerard Autet Serrabasa (born 8 September 1978) is a Spanish retired footballer who played as a central defender. Football career Autet was born in Manlleu, Barcelona, Catalonia. During his early career, he played lower league football with Palamós CF and RCD Espanyol's B-team. He subsequently represented Levante UD and Xerez CD, with both clubs competing in the second division. After five seasons in Andalusia, Gerard moved to Sporting de Gijón for the 2007–08 season, being an instrumental figure in the side's promotion to La Liga. His competition debut on 21 September 2008 was a sour one, as the Asturians were crushed 1–6 at home against FC Barcelona and he was sent off before the hour-mark; he did contribute solidly in the club's narrow escape from relegation, appearing in 26 games and scoring in a 2–1 home win over Málaga CF on 17 May 2009.Only third or fourth-string stopper in the 2009–10 campaign, Autet only appeared in eight league matches, mainly due to suspensions or injuries to either Grégory Arnolin or Alberto Botía. He did start in all of those (seven complete) as Sporting again managed to retain its top division status. References External links Gerard Autet at BDFutbol Gerard Autet
