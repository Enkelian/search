Nintendo Fusion Tour
Nintendo Fusion Tour was a touring rock music and video game festival sponsored by Nintendo, which began in 2003. Nintendo's Fusion Tour provided early exposure for then-developing bands such as Evanescence, Story of the Year, My Chemical Romance, Fall Out Boy, Anberlin and Panic! at the Disco. The outing expanded from 25 dates in 2003 with 90,000 in attendance to 45 in 2006 with more than 160,000, according to Nintendo.
