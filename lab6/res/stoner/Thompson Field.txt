Thompson Field
Thompson is a primarily residential community in San Antonio, Texas. The neighborhood is 6 miles (9.7 km) west of Downtown San Antonio located between U.S. Highway 90 and Port San Antonio, with the Union Pacific railroad tracks and Lackland AFB servings as its east and west boundaries, respectively. Thompson is a collection of individual residential areas that were developed independently over a wide span of time. The area is the gateway to Port San Antonio and saw heaviest development during the 1940s, 50s and 60s. Many residents and families in the community were once stationed at or otherwise employed at the former Kelly AFB which gives the area its strong working-class and military tradition. History The Thompson moniker originates from Thompson Place, the primary eastâ€“west thoroughfare. The history of Thompson is fundamentally tied to the history of the former Kelly Air Force Base and now Port San Antonio[1]. Kelly helped many of the areas residents by giving them higher-wage jobs that otherwise would have been inaccessible, allowing the area to achieve a slightly higher affluence than the surrounding area.
