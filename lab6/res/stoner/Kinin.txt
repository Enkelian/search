Kinin
A kinin is any of various structurally related polypeptides, such as bradykinin and kallidin. They are members of the autacoid family.They act locally to induce vasodilation and contraction of smooth muscle. Kinins function as mediators for inflammatory responses by triggering the immune system. They are also able to regulate cardiovascular and renal function through mediating the effects of ACE inhibitors.It is a component of the kinin-kallikrein system. Their precursors are kininogens.In botany, the plant hormones known as cytokinins were first called kinins, but the name was changed to avoid confusion.Aspirin inhibits the activation of kallenogen by interfering with the formation of kallikrein enzyme which is essential in the process of activation.
