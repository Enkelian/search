Andalusian classical music
Andalusian classical music (طرب أندَلُسي, trans. ṭarab andalusi, Spanish: música andalusí) is a style of Arabic music found in different styles across the Maghreb (Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, and Libya in the form of the Ma'luf style) and the Levant. It originated out of the music of Al-Andalus (Muslim Iberia) between the 9th and 15th centuries. Some of its poems were found to be composed by authors such as Al-Shushtari, Ibn al-Khatib and Al-Mu'tamid ibn Abbad. Origins Andalusian classical music was allegedly born in the Emirate of Cordoba (Al-Andalus) in the 9th century. The Arab/ Kurdish or Persian musician (his origins are unknown, but historians agree that he was called blackbird, a reference to his skin color), residing in Iraq, Ziryâb (d. 857), who later became court musician of Abd al-Rahman II in Cordoba, is sometimes credited with its invention. Later, the poet, composer, and philosopher Ibn Bajjah (d. 1139) of Saragossa is said to have combined the style of Ziryâb with Western approaches to produce a wholly new style that spread across Iberia and North Africa. By the 10th century, Muslim Iberia had become a center for the manufacture of instruments. These goods spread gradually to Provence, influencing French troubadours
