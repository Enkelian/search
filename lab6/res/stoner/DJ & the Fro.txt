DJ & the Fro
DJ & the Fro is an animated series that aired on MTV. The show focuses on two co-workers, DJ and The Fro, who work at the fictitious company Oppercon Industries. They rarely do work, and instead look for funny videos on the Internet, which they comment on (similar to Beavis and Butthead and Station Zero with music videos). The series was created by Dave Jeser and Matt Silverstein, who originally created Comedy Central's Drawn Together. Within weeks of its debut, DJ & the Fro was moved from its 5:00 pm (est) time slot to 12:30 am (est) time slot due to the Parents Television Council deeming it "too racy for daytime t.v."
