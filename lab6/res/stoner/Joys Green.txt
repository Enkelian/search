About Joys Green The village of Joys Green which is still part of the Parish of Lydbrook now currently has no Village Shop or Post Office, which is hopefully going to be re-opened eventually. Neither does it have the Primary School which closed back in late 2008 to become a young peoples directorate, leaving all of the students there (at most 15 children) to transfer to the other local primary school in Lydbrook. The village still has its own playground with play equipment on and a small football pitch, this is currently situated where Joys Green Football Club pitch used to be. The Joys Green community centre is also still situated within the old primary school grounds and meetings regarding the local area are often either held there or at the Lydbrook Memorial Hall. Recently Two Rivers Housing has invested in nearly five or six new properties and renovated a lot of properties within the area. As well as the new houses Joys Green is still home to the Edwards Close housing estate
