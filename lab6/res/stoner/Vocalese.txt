Vocalese
Vocalese is a style or musical genre of jazz singing in which words are added to a soloist's improvisation. Kurt Elling describes the style as such: "Although the word 'vocalise' was first applied more strictly to Jon Hendricks' work in big band/multi-voice settings, it quickly broadened through general use to mean any application of a vocally presented lyric based on melodies first recorded by jazz instrumentalists, whether solos -a feat that could only have happened with the advent of recorded sound -the early composers of such lyrics essentially invented a new art form."Where scat singing uses nonsense words such as "bap ba dee dot bwee dee" in solos, vocalese uses lyrics set to pre-existing instrumental solos. In a 'first wave' of vocalese creation, this sometimes took the form of a tribute to the original instrumentalist, such as Eddie Jefferson's version of "Body and Soul", which featured lyrics about Coleman Hawkins, whose landmark solo on the tune is globally recognized. The word "vocalese" is a play on the musical term vocalise and the suffix "-ese", meant to indicate a sort of language. The term is attributed to jazz critic Leonard Feather to describe the first Lambert, Hendricks, & Ross album, Sing
