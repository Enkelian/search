New York Apples

The team was originally known as the New York Sets to match the names of other successful New York sports teams including the New York Mets baseball team, the New York Jets football team, and the New York Nets basketball team. They won the 1976 WTT championship under that name led by Billie Jean King. Prior to the 1977 season, the defending champion Sets held a contest to choose a new name for the team, and Apples was selected.
