Ressurection Joe
"Ressurection Joe" is a single by the English rock band The Cult and was released on 14 December 1984. The single is "stand-alone" and was not featured on any studio album by the group. "Ressurection Joe" was later, in 1986, included on the first United Kingdom compact disc versions of the Dreamtime album (Beggars Banquet catalogue number BEGA 57CD) as a bonus track. Spelling Often the title of the song is indicated as being misspelled. While the correct spelling of the word is resurrection, Jamie Stewart stated that he accidentally misspelled the word when designing the single's picture sleeve and the misspelled title was retained as the "official" song title. On some subsequent compilation releases, the group's label has spelled the word in conventional form. Song Origins The song was originally written and performed (live) when the group was still Death Cult under the title "The Ressurection Song." The earliest versions bore no resemblance, musically or lyrically, to the final version. The song was gradually transformed into the final version during the later months of 1983, while the group was on its second concert tour of the United Kingdom. B-Side The B-side of the seven-inch single is a remixed version
