Lower March
The Lower March (Arabic: الثغر الأدنى‎, al-Ṯaḡr al-ʾAdnā) was a march of the Al Andalus. It included territory that is now in Portugal.As a borderland territory, it was home to the so-called muwalladun or indigenous converts and their descendants, some of these eventually established dynastic lordship such as the case of Ibn Marwan al-Jilliqi who ruled Merida and the region around Badajoz during the early part of the ninth century. Several rebellion occurred in the territory, with rebels most notably ibn Hafsun and two of his sons refusing to recognize the Cordoba's sovereignty. Even after his death small pockets of independent resistance persisted. It was only a decade after Hafsun's demise that the emir of Cordoba was able to completely quell the rebellion in the Lower March. == References ==
