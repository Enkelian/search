Airbus A318
The Airbus A318 is the smallest airliner in the Airbus A320 family. The A318 carries 107 to 132 passengers and has a maximum range of 5,700 km (3,100 nmi). Final assembly of the aircraft took place in Hamburg, Germany. It is intended primarily for short-range service, although British Airways uses the aircraft on a London City Airport to New York-JFK Airport transatlantic route (albeit with a stopover in Shannon for refueling on the westbound leg, as it is too heavy to clear the short runway at LCY with a full load of fuel). The aircraft shares a common type rating with all other Airbus A320 family variants, allowing existing A320 family pilots to fly the aircraft without the need for further training. It is the largest commercial aircraft certified by the European Aviation Safety Agency for steep approach operations, allowing flights at airports such as London City.The A318 entered service in July 2003 with Frontier Airlines. Relative to other Airbus A320 family variants, it has sold in only small numbers with total orders for 80 aircraft placed, with the order book currently being empty. It also has an excellent safety record with zero accidents as of 2018. As of January
