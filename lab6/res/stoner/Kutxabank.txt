Kutxabank
Kutxabank is a bank based in the Basque Autonomous Community of Spain. It was officially founded on 1 January 2012 out of the merger of three Basque financial institutions operating on their respective provinces: Bilbao Bizkaia Kutxa (BBK), Gipuzkoa Donostia Kutxa (Kutxa), and Caja Vital Kutxa (Vital).Required by the Spanish Government's deadline, all three institutions ceased to exist as savings banks after a long period of internal deliberation and integration. Kutxabank operates in Andalusia and Extremadura with the brand CajaSur. History The European stress test measuring solvency in periods of credit crisis showed that Kutxabank ranked first in Spain, standing out as the soundest financial institution (data published in October 2014). == References ==
