West Side Stadium
The West Side Stadium (also known as the New York Sports and Convention Center) was a proposed football and Olympic stadium to be built on a platform over the rail yards on the West Side of Manhattan in New York City.The stadium would have been an all-weather facility with a retractable roof, allowing it to be used as either a 200,000-square-foot (18,600 m2) indoor convention hall, or an 85,000-seat (75,000 post-Olympics) indoor-outdoor sporting event stadium. It was to be the new home for the New York Jets of the National Football League, who at the time of the proposal played at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, and were junior tenants to the New York Giants. The stadium was to have served as the centerpiece of New York's bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics, but, after heated debate, the proposal was defeated a month before the International Olympic Committee was to make its decision. In the football off-season the building would have been used as an adjunct to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center for conventions and as a replacement for Madison Square Garden. It was promoted by then New York Governor George Pataki, New York City Mayor Michael
