Hammer of the Gods (2013 film)
Hammer of the Gods is a 2013 British action film directed by Farren Blackburn and released on 5 July 2013. In it, a dying Viking king sends his son on a quest to seek out his older brother, the clan's only hope for defeating an approaching enemy horde. Plot Britain 871 AD. Young Norse prince Steinar arrives in England with a complement of 500 reserve warriors to combat a Saxon uprising that is crushing the occupying forces led by his father, King Bagsecg. Arriving at his father's camp, Steiner attends a family meeting with his father, his older brother Harold, and their younger half brother Vali, who is disliked by everyone but Steinar for being half Saxon. Absent is their older brother, Hakan, who has not been seen for over a decade due to a bitter animosity between him and their father, the cause unknown to Steinar. Bagsecg, who is bed ridden and dying, dreads of leaving the throne to Harold (now next in line due to Hakan's absence) whose insistence that diplomacy being their best option would instead put their clan under English rule. He orders Steinar to kill Vali for cowardice, to test his strength as a leader.
