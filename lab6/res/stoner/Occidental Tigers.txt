Occidental Tigers
Located in Los Angeles, Occidental College competes in the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SCIAC) at the NCAA's Division III level. Approximately 25 percent of all students play a varsity sport, and nearly half of all students participate in all athletics activities combined (including a host of club sports and intramural leagues). History In 1889-90 Professor James Parkhill (Occidental Collegeâ€™s fourth president, from 1896-97) organized intramural games for interested College men and Academy boys. His enthusiastic leadership laid the groundwork for establishing the nickname (Tigers) and school colors (orange and black) after his undergraduate alma mater, Princeton. Traditions Every year Occidental plays two football games for rivalry trophies. One game is against Pomona-Pitzer and the winner is awarded "The Drum." The Drum rivalry is the oldest rivalry game in Southern California, having been contested since 1895. Oxy leads Pomona-Pitzer all time in the series 65-54-3. The other game is against Whittier College and the winner is awarded "The Shoes," which are a pair of bronzed cleats from a 1940 graduate from Whittier named Myron Claxton. Teams The Tigers have 10 varsity men's teams and 11 varsity women's teams. They also have six club sport teams. Men's Baseball Basketball Cross Country
