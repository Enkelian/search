The boy who was the bellhop dropped the telegram off to Quentin Reynolds first and he then took the small package across the room to Ralph Denistoun. When Ralph saw on the box where it had come from he got behind a curtain and opened it. The package had a pair of golden earrings in it. He then, using the window as a mirror, held one of the rings up to his pierced ears.
