The same study found that Ibogamine (40mg/kg) and Coronaridine (40mg/kg) did not produce "any tremor effects in rats that differ significantly from saline control". While the related alkaloids Ibogaine(20-40 mg/kg), harmaline (10-40 mg/kg) and desethylcoronaridine (10-40 mg/kg) were "obviously tremorgenic".
