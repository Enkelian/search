Live on I-5
Live on I-5 is a live album by the American rock band Soundgarden. It was recorded during the West Coast leg of their 1996 tour, and released on March 22, 2011. They announced the album, the band's first live album, on their website on January 13, 2011. The title is a reference to Interstate 5, which runs along the Pacific coast of the United States. The band hired Adam Kasper to record several shows with a rented 24-track machine/truck. They planned to release the live album after the tour, but they disbanded and the tapes were left in Studio X (then Bad Animals Studio). A live version of "Blow Up the Outside World" was released as a 256 bit MP3 download to those who pre-ordered Live on I-5 from Soundgarden's official website.
