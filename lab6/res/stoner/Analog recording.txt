Analog recording
Analog recording (Greek, ana is "according to" and logos "relationship," "word") is a technique used for the recording of analog signals which, among many possibilities, allows analog audio and analog video for later playback. Analog audio recording began with mechanical systems such as the phonautograph and phonograph. Later, electronic techniques such as wire recording and tape recorder were developed. Analog recording methods store signals as a continuous signal in or on the media. The signal may be stored as a physical texture on a phonograph record, or a fluctuation in the field strength of a magnetic recording. This is different from digital recording where digital signals are quantized and represented as discrete numbers. Phonautograph The phonautograph is the earliest known device for recording sound. The phonograph The phonograph was the first machine used to capture and reproduce analog sound, and was invented by the well-known inventor Thomas Edison in 1877. Edison incorporated various elements into his Phonograph that would become staples that can be found in recording devices to this day. Recording For a sound to be recorded by the Phonograph, it has to go through three distinct steps. First, the sound enters a cone-shaped component of the device, called
