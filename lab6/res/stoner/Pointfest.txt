Pointfest
Pointfest is a large outdoor rock music festival held once a year by radio station KPNT in St. Louis, Missouri at the Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre (formerly known as Verizon Wireless Amphitheater, UMB Bank Pavilion, and Riverport Amphitheater) The festival has featured almost every popular alternative and hard rock group in America. Local music favorites The Urge, Gravity Kills, Story of the Year, Ludo, and Greek Fire have made several appearances as well. Traditionally, there is a main stage where the larger acts and headliners perform, and two or more stages off to the sides of the lawn for other bands (one of them usually reserved for local bands). The side stages will play from the start of the concert (generally around 10 am) to when the main stage will start playing (generally around 6 pm).
