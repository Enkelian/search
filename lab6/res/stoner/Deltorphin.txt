Deltorphin
Deltorphin, also known as deltorphin A and dermenkephalin, is a naturally occurring, exogenous opioid heptapeptide and thus, exorphin, with the amino acid sequence Tyr-D-Met-Phe-His-Leu-Met-Asp-NH2. Along with the other deltorphins (such as deltorphin I and deltorphin II) and the dermorphins, deltorphin is endogenous to frogs of the genus Phyllomedusa such as P. bicolor and P. sauvagei where it is produced in their skin, and is not known to occur naturally in any other species. Deltorphin is one of the highest affinity and most selective naturally occurring opioid peptides known, acting as a very potent and highly specific agonist of the Î´-opioid receptor.
