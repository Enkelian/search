Recover (band)
Recover is an American rock band from Austin, Texas. History Recover is a post-hardcore band composed of Dan Keyes (guitar/vocals), Robert Mann (guitar/vocals), Ross Tweedy (bass), and Santiago "Jimmy" Vela III (drums). The band recorded a four-song demo in the spring of 2000. The demo found its way to Fueled by Ramen Records via the band's friends in fellow Austin band The Impossibles. The band later released their debut album, Rodeo & Picasso, in the summer of 2001. The band toured extensively in support of the album, and in 2002, released a follow-up EP on Fiddler Records, Ceci n'est pas recover. The band continued an exhaustive touring schedule with bands such as Jimmy Eat World, AFI, The Get Up Kids, Braid, Thrice, My Chemical Romance, Thursday, Taking Back Sunday and Coheed and Cambria. The band would eventually sign to Universal imprint Strummer Recordings, alongside The Rapture and The Mars Volta in late 2002. In summer 2003, the band retreated to Austin Texas to write their second full-length, "This May Be The Year I Disappear" with the help from producer Rory Phillips, a process that would take eight months due to recording setbacks. The band later recorded material with Linkin Park
