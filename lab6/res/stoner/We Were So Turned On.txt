We Were So Turned On
We Were So Turned On: A Tribute to David Bowie is a David Bowie tribute album released worldwide on September 6, 2010 by Manimal Vinyl as a charity for War Child UK. The album features contributions from Duran Duran, Carla Bruni, Mick Karn, John Frusciante, Warpaint, Devendra Banhart, Vivian Girls, Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros, A Place to Bury Strangers and others. The project was started in early 2008 by Manimal Vinyl's founder Paul Beahan. The album was originally planned to feature contributions from Radiohead, Nine Inch Nails and MGMT, who all pulled out due to recording and scheduling conflicts. The cover artwork was created by Los Angeles-based artist owleyes and the inside artwork was created by artist and musician Nico Turner. The cover includes three images of the inside artwork from the gatefold edition of the album Aladdin Sane filled with psychedelic graphics. The label released A Place to Bury Strangers' cover of "Suffragette City" on the music blog Cover Me one week before the album.
