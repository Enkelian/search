Andrew Geoffrey Kaufman (; January 17, 1949 â€“ May 16, 1984) was an American entertainer, actor, writer, wrestler and performance artist. While often called a comedian, Kaufman described himself instead as a "song and dance man".

The comedian's promise is that he will go out there and make you laugh with him...
