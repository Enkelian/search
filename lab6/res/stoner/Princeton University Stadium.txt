Princeton University Stadium
Princeton University Stadium is a stadium in Princeton, New Jersey, United States. It is primarily used for American football, and is the home field of the Princeton Tigers. The stadium opened in 1998 on the site of Princeton's former stadium, Palmer Stadium, and seats 27,773. The year and a half needed to tear down Palmer Stadium and build the new field where it had stood meant that Princeton would not have an operational stadium for the 1997 season. Because of this the team was forced to play all of its games on the road. The stadium's exterior shell mirrors the layout of Palmer Stadium, and the grandstands are four sided, with a second deck added on all sides except the south. The press box and luxury boxes are located above the west-side upper deck. One of the stadium's structural pillars houses the University's new rock-climbing wall, which opened in the fall of 2008. In addition to the stadium itself, the building project included building a track to the immediate south of the venue, which shares the stadium's south end facilities. (Previously, the track was located inside the stadium.) Recently, FieldTurf was installed replacing the former grass surface at Princeton Stadium.
