The Grime and the Glow
The Grime and the Glow is the first studio album from American singer-songwriter Chelsea Wolfe, released December 28, 2010. Writing and composition Background After stepping away from the music she had made in her younger years, in the summer of 2009, Chelsea Wolfe embarked on a European tour with a group of performance artists, playing in unusual spaces, including cathedrals, basements and old nuclear plants for whoever would listen. After she returned home, she started over her approach to making music and began writing and recording with her old Tascam 488 8-track recorder, and those recordings would eventually lead to The Grime and The Glow.
