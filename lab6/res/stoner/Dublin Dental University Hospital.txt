Dublin Dental University Hospital
Dublin Dental University Hospital (Irish: Ospidéal Déadach Ollscoile Átha Cliath) is a dental health and teaching facility in Lincoln Place, Dublin, Ireland. History The facility was established in a building off St Stephen's Green in 1879. It moved to a purpose-built building in Lincoln Place in 1895. Since the 1990s, the Trinity College School of Dental Science, established by amalgamating the dental schools of Trinity College Dublin, University College Dublin and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, has been based in the hospital. The hospital was extended in 1998 and again in 2010, in the latter case with a four-storey atrium exhibiting a sculpture by Fergus Martin. References External links Official site
