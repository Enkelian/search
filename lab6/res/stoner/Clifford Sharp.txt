He was rescued by recruitment to the Foreign Office, and was sent to neutral Sweden, in association with Arthur Ransome.In 1909 Sharp married Rosamund Bland, who was the adopted daughter of Edith Nesbit, the author of The Railway Children, and the natural daughter of Nesbit's husband Hubert Bland. == Notes ==
