Cortisol
Cortisol is a steroid hormone, in the glucocorticoid class of hormones. When used as a medication, it is known as hydrocortisone. It is produced in many animals, mainly by the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex in the adrenal gland. It is produced in other tissues in lower quantities. It is released with a diurnal cycle and its release is increased in response to stress and low blood-glucose concentration. It functions to increase blood sugar through gluconeogenesis, to suppress the immune system, and to aid in the metabolism of fat, protein, and carbohydrates. It also decreases bone formation. Health effects Metabolic response Metabolism of glucose In general, cortisol stimulates the synthesis of 'new' glucose from non-carbohydrate sources; this is known as gluconeogenesis, mainly in the liver, but also in the kidneys and small intestine under certain circumstances. The net effect is an increase in the concentration of glucose in the blood, further complemented by a decrease in the sensitivity of peripheral tissue to insulin, thus preventing this tissue from taking the glucose from the blood. Last, cortisol has a permissive effect on the actions of hormones that increase glucose production, such as glucagon and adrenaline.Cortisol also plays an important, but
