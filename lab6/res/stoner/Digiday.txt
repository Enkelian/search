Digiday
Digiday is an online trade magazine for online media founded in 2008 by Nick Friese. It is headquartered in New York City, with offices in London and Tokyo. Description Digiday provides daily online news about advertising, publishing, and media, and also produces events such as industry summits and awards galas. Founder Nick Friese created the publication in April 2008. With support Doug Carlson, managing director of Zinio, Friese put together a Digital Publishing and Advertising Conference in a New York City hotel. Originally called DM2 Events (an abbreviation of Digital Media and Marketing Events), a colleague came up with "Digiday" as a shorter version of Friese's proposed "Digital-Day". The company depends on a variety of offerings to generate revenue, claiming that half of its revenue comes from advertising, branded content, sponsored content, and career listings, and the other half coming from hosting events and conducting awards programs. It further claims that these sources have provided "double-digit revenue growth" in the mid-to-late 2010s. Digiday also has a podcast series covering client, agency, and media perspectives.Fortune magazine wrote of Digiday, "[y]ou might not have heard of an online publication called Digidayâ€”unless you spend all of your time reading about the media industry,
