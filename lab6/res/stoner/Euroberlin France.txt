Euroberlin France
Euroberlin France was a Franco-German joint venture airline founded in 1988. Overview It was jointly owned by Air France and Lufthansa, with the former holding a 51% stake and the latter the remaining 49%. Euroberlin France's corporate headquarters was located in Paris, France while Berlin Tegel Airport in what used to be West Berlin in the days prior to Germany's reunification was its operational headquarters.The airline commenced commercial operations from Tegel Airport at the start of the 1988-'89 winter timetable with a fleet of four Boeing 737-300 jet aircraft leased from Monarch Airlines. Monarch Airlines supplied all of Euroberlin's flightdeck crew, while Monarch's sister company Monarch Aircraft Engineering provided the maintenance support for the Euroberlin operation at Tegel, under a wet lease agreement. Air France staff at the French flag carrier's Paris headquarters performed all of Euroberlin's administrative functions. As a result of these arrangements, most employees on Euroberlin's payroll were flight attendants. (Groundhandling at Tegel Airport and the other stations served was outsourced to a third party handling agent as well.) German reunification in October 1990 resulted in Air France and Lufthansa adjusting their stakes in Euroberlin so that each airline owned exactly 50% of its share capital. This
