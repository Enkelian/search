Back to the Light
Back to the Light is the first solo album by Queen guitarist Brian May released on 28 September 1992 in the UK and on 2 February 1993 in the United States and Canada. The album contains the Top 10 singles "Too Much Love Will Kill You" and "Driven by You". Overview The album was recorded between 1988 and 1992 at the Allerton Hill Studios and mixed at the Metropolis Studios. It is Brian May's second non-Queen album after 1983 Star Fleet Project. The track "Just One Life" was written as a tribute to the actor Philip Sayer, who died in 1989. "Rollin' Over" is a cover of Small Faces song from the album Ogdens' Nut Gone Flake. An alternate "explicit" version of "Love Token" was recorded with lyrics which may have been deemed offensive by the record label. The lyric "shit for brains" was replaced by "meat for brains," while the lyrics "well, fuck you" were replaced by "that's a shame." The original "explicit" version was never officially released except on a free CD packaged with RCD Magazine, Vol. 4. The songs "Headlong" and "I Can't Live with You" released on Queen album Innuendo were originally intended to be included
