Downtown Albuquerque
Downtown Albuquerque is the central business district of Albuquerque, New Mexico. It is where a significant number of the city's highrise buildings are located, and is the center of government and business for the Greater Albuquerque metropolitan region. Downtown is roughly defined as the central area bordered by Marble Avenue to the North, Coal Avenue to the South, Sixth Street to the East, and the Amtrak and New Mexico Rail Runner Express railroad tracks to the West. The area on the east side of the railroad tracks is known as East Downtown or EDo. The downtown area can be easily accessed by several freeway exits from Interstate 25. Street grid Downtown Albuquerque is laid out in a standard grid pattern, with numbered north-south streets and named east-west avenues. Central Avenue (originally known as Railroad Avenue) is the main east-west thoroughfare through the center of Downtown, while Lomas Boulevard (originally New York Avenue) is a major east-west arterial through the north part of downtown. The streets start with First Street just west of the railroad tracks and increase in number moving westward. Fourth Street was originally the main north-south thoroughfare through Downtown but today it is discontinuous, interrupted by Civic Plaza.
