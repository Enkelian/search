Magic Circle Festival
Magic Circle Festival is an annual heavy metal festival organized by Magic Circle Music and founded by Joey DeMaio of the band Manowar. The festival was first held on 6 and 7 July 2007 in Bad Arolsen, Germany. The success of the 2007 festival, headlined by Manowar and attended by 25,000 people, led to an expanded festival in 2008, held over four days from 9 to 12 July. The lineup for the 2008 festival comprised a number of international acts, including Alice Cooper, Whitesnake, W.A.S.P. and Def Leppard. However, organisational and contractual difficulties led to the cancellation of Whitesnake and Def Leppard. In 2009, the festival was scaled back to two days and held in Lorelei on 18 and 19 July. The fourth Magic Circle Festival took place in Metalcamp in Slovenia at 11 July 2010, and on 25 July 2014 the fifth and currently latest Magic Circle Festival was held in Helsinki.
