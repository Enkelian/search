Maybe for Sure
"Maybe for Sure" is a 1989 song by the American singer Debbie Harry, released as a single from her third solo album Def, Dumb & Blonde. Song information "Maybe For Sure" was written during Harry's time with the band Blondie. Despite being produced by Blondie's producer Mike Chapman, the single was not a success, peaking at #89 in the UK and was not released at all in the US. The song itself is a reworked version of the song "Angel's Song", from the 1983 animated film Rock & Rule, which was written by Debbie Harry and Chris Stein. A remixed version of the track called the "Tunguska Event 7" mix" was later featured on the US charity album Just Say Da (Volume IV Of Just Say Yes).
