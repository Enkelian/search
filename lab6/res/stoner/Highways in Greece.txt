Highways in Greece
Highways in Greece are generally organized so that the odd-numbered highways are of north-south alignment and even numbered highways are of east-west alignment. However, there are many exceptions. The designation of some important roads of Greece as "national" was decided by a 1955 decree, while a minister's decision in 1963 determined the numbering of these roads. In 1998, a survey of the Hellenic Statistical Authority defined some new national roads that were constructed after the 1963 decision. Furthermore, motorway numbers in Greece are different and irrelevant to other highways' numbers. For example, Motorway 6 (A6) refers to the Attiki Odos motorway, while "GR-6" refers to National Road 6. With a total length of about 2.500 km as of 2017, Greece's motorway network is the biggest one in Southeastern Europe and one of the most advanced in Europe. Motorways Greece's motorway network has been extensively modernized throughout the 2000s and part of it is still under construction. Most of it was completed by early 2017.
