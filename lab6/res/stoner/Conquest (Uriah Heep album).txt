Conquest (Uriah Heep album)
Conquest is the 13th album by British rock band Uriah Heep, released in 1980. It was released worldwide by Bronze Records, but not in North America, where it was difficult to find even as an import.1979-80 was a period of change for Heep, with John Sloman taking over lead vocal duties, Lee Kerslake bowing out from behind the drumstool, and main songwriter Ken Hensley ultimately leaving the band. Taken together with the commercial rock sound of the album, this is the most contentious era of Uriah Heep's history, with many fans believing Conquest is the group's worst record. Despite this era being regarded in hindsight as something of a disaster by Hensley as well as Mick Box, the album did receive some positive reviews at the time, namely a five-star rating from Record Mirror and three-and-a-half stars from Geoff Barton in Sounds. It also sold well enough to crack the Top 40 of the UK album charts, whereas all three of the band's previous records with John Lawton had failed to chart in the UK at all. The original UK release came in a single, matte LP sleeve, stickered with 'Special 10th Anniversary Price Â£3.99', with the liner being heavy-stock
