Butt-Numb-A-Thon
The Butt-Numb-A-Thon (also known as BNAT) was an annual film marathon held every December since 1999 in Austin, Texas. It was hosted by Harry Knowles of the Ain't It Cool News website in celebration of his birthday. The festival showed 24 hours of vintage films as well as premieres. Following revelations of sexual assault accusations against Knowles in September 2017, the festival ceased. Event admission The marathon was invite-only via an application process. Before BNAT 5 in 2003, there were typically two ways to gain admittance â€“ one for Austin residents that usually involved some event, such as BNAT 4 in 2002 having a costume contest at a horror movie screening at an abandoned mental institution on Halloween, then a separate one for those not in the Central Texas area. After BNAT 5, the application process was changed to internet-only involving several essay-style questions and submissions of pictures. Films and notable guests Films that were shown include the first public screening of Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, as well as The Lord of the Rings trilogy, Dreamgirls, Chicago, Black Snake Moan, Snatch, Magnolia, Knocked Up, Frozen, 300, V for Vendetta, Kingsman: The Secret Service, and the 2005 remake
