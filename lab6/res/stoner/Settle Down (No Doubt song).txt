The song received positive reviews from music critics, who praised the band for "returning to form" and for being familiar with their other songs. Some critics wrote that it resembles the songs from their fifth album Rock Steady, and particularly "Hey Baby", while some others compared it to Santigold songs. A music video for the song was directed by Sophie Muller and released on July 16, 2012.
