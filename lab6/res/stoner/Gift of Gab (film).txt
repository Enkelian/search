Gift of Gab (film)
Gift of Gab is a 1934 black-and-white film released by Universal Pictures. Edmund Lowe stars as a man with the "Gift of Gab"—he can sell anyone anything. The film costars Ruth Etting, Ethel Waters, Victor Moore, and Gloria Stuart, and features Boris Karloff and Béla Lugosi. The film's sets were designed by the art director David Garber. Ruth Etting sings "Talking to Myself" and "Tomorrow, Who Cares?" Originally the Three Stooges were signed to appear in the film, but they had just signed with Columbia Pictures for Woman Haters, the first of their short subjects, so three look-alike actors replaced them in Gift of Gab.
