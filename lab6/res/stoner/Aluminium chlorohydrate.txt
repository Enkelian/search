Aluminium chlorohydrate
Aluminum chlorohydrate is a group of specific aluminum salts having the general formula AlnCl(3n-m)(OH)m. It is used in cosmetics as an antiperspirant and as a coagulant in water purification. In water purification, this compound is preferred in some cases because of its high charge, which makes it more effective at destabilizing and removing suspended materials than other aluminum salts such as aluminum sulfate, aluminum chloride and various forms of polyaluminum chloride (PAC) and polyaluminum chlorisulfate, in which the aluminum structure results in a lower net charge than aluminum chlorohydrate. Further, the high degree of neutralization of the HCl results in minimal impact on treated water pH when compared to other aluminum and iron salts. Uses Aluminum chlorohydrate is one of the most common active ingredients in commercial antiperspirants. The variation most commonly used in deodorants and antiperspirants is Al2Cl(OH)5. Aluminum chlorohydrate is also used as a coagulant in water and wastewater treatment processes to remove dissolved organic matter and colloidal particles present in suspension. Safety The Food and Drug Administration considers the use of aluminum chlorohydrate in antiperspirants to be safe and it is permitted in concentrations up to 25%.
