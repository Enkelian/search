Trapped in a Box
"Trapped in a Box" is a 1992 song by American rock band No Doubt. It was released as their debut single on February 25, 1992 from their debut album No Doubt. Despite failing to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, it was included on their greatest hits album The Singles 1992–2003. Background Within the booklet of The Singles 1992–2003 is a blurb on each song. The short paragraph on "Trapped in a Box" states: The oldest track in this collection, "Trapped in a Box" is the sole representative of No Doubt's eponymous major label debut and a good barometer for their development. Beginning as a poem Tom wrote for school, bandleader at the time Eric Stefani then shaped the arrangement with everyone contributing lyrics. Together for six years when recorded, the band had moved beyond their ska roots. The horn section and quasi-ska rhythms remain inspired by those early Madness/Fishbone influences, while the emerging sense of flow and pop bounce makes the track a benchmark for the time and a notable milestone today. Ostensibly their first official single, "Trapped" was admittedly too out there for the radio of the time. It wasn't aggressively promoted and largely fell upon deaf ears
