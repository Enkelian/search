History The Life I Remember (2014â€“2015) In 2014, after Logan Mader had spent more than a decade away from the stage, Monte Conner of Nuclear Blast sent Australian musician Lauren Hart to him for a production deal. Once they met, Hart switched from guitars to vocals. Damien Rainaud then joined on bass with Ralph Alexander stepping in on drums.
