12-inch single
The twelve-inch single (often simply called a 12-inch or 12″) is a type of gramophone record that has wider groove spacing and shorter playing time compared to LPs. This allows for louder levels to be cut on the disc by the mastering engineer, which in turn gives a wider dynamic range, and thus better sound quality. This record type is commonly used in disco and dance music genres, where DJs use them to play in clubs. They are played at either ​33 1⁄3 or 45 rpm. Technical features Twelve-inch singles typically have much shorter playing time than full-length LPs, and thus require fewer grooves per inch. This extra space permits a broader dynamic range or louder recording level as the grooves' excursions (i.e., the width of the groove waves and distance traveled from side to side by the turntable stylus) can be much greater in amplitude, especially in the bass frequencies important for dance music. Many record companies began producing 12-inch (30 cm) singles at ​33 1⁄3 rpm, although 45 rpm gives better treble response and was used on many twelve-inch singles, especially in the UK.
