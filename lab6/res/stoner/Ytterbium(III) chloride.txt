Ytterbium(III) chloride
Ytterbium(III) chloride (YbCl3) is an inorganic chemical compound. It reacts with NiCl2 to form a very effective catalyst for the reductive dehalogenation of aryl halides. It is poisonous if injected, and mildly toxic by ingestion. It is an experimental teratogen, known to irritate the skin and eyes. When heated to decomposition it emits toxic fumes of Clâˆ’. History Ytterbium, a lanthanide series element, was discovered in 1878 by the Swiss chemist Jean-Charles Galissard de Marignac, who named the element after a town (Ytterby) in Sweden. The first synthesis of YbCl3 in the literature was that of Jan Hoogschagen in 1946. YbCl3 is now a commercially available source of Yb3+ ions and therefore of significant chemical interest. Chemical properties The valence electron configuration of Yb+3 (from YbCl3) is 4f135s25p6, which has crucial implications for the chemical behaviour of Yb+3. Also, the size of Yb+3 governs its catalytic behaviour and biological applications. For example, while both Ce+3 and Yb+3 have a single unpaired f electron, Ce+3 is much larger than Yb+3 because lanthanides become much smaller with increasing effective nuclear charge as a consequence of the f electrons not being as well shielded as d electrons. This behavior is known as the
