Boomer and Gio
Boomer and Gio (previously Boomer and Carton from 2007–2017 and The Morning Show with Boomer in 2017) is a morning drive sports radio program on WFAN-AM and WFAN-FM in New York City. It is hosted by former National Football League player Boomer Esiason and radio personality Gregg Giannotti. The show originated in 2007 as a replacement for Don Imus's morning program after he was fired by CBS Radio. It debuted on September 4, 2007, with Esiason and radio veteran Craig Carton (formerly of The Jersey Guys) as the original hosts. During its 10-year run, Boomer and Carton garnered strong ratings, placing first among men ages 25–54. In September 2017, Carton left the program after his arrest and subsequent charges for securities and wire fraud resulting from a ticket Ponzi scheme. The show was temporarily rebranded around Esiason while he served as the sole host. Giannotti took over as co-host in January 2018, and the program was renamed Boomer and Gio. The show was simulcast on MSG Network from September 14, 2010 through September 13, 2013, and began airing on CBS Sports Network on January 6, 2014.
