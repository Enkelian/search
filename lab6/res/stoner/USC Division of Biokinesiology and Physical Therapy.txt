The division grants doctoral degrees in physical therapy (DPT) and biokinesiology (PhD), as well as master's degrees in biokinesiology. In addition, the division offers residency programs in orthopedic physical therapy, neurologic physical therapy, sports physical therapy, as well as pediatric physical therapy. History The precursor of the Division of Biokinesiology and Physical Therapy was established as an apprenticeship program at the Orthopedic Hospital of Los Angeles in 1942. The physical therapy program was started by Dr. Charles Lowman, who was an orthopedic physician trained at USC, and Susan Roen, who was the head physical therapist at the Orthopedic Hospital and an assistant instructor in the USC Physical Education Department. Their successful cooperation, especially in underwater therapy, drew international attention; President Franklin D. Roosevelt consulted with Dr. Lowman about therapy for his illness. Catherine Worthingham - who graduated under their guidance - went on to contribute greatly to the physical therapy profession through education, practice, and research, and advanced the profession to a high level
