Würth Stahl History The district was created in 1973 by merging the previous districts Öhringen and Künzelsau. It was named after the family of Hohenlohe, who once had ruled most of the area, until 1806 when they lost their independence as this area became part of the kingdom of Württemberg. Geography The two main rivers of the districts are the Kocher and Jagst, both affluents to the Neckar. The highest elevation of the district with 523 m is the Mühlberg near Waldenburg. Partnerships Since 1990 the district has a partnership with the County Limerick in the Republic of Ireland. In the same year it also started a friendship with the district Großenhain (now Riesa-Großenhain) in the Free State of Saxony, helping to build the administration according to West German standards. Dialect The dialect spoken locally is Hohenlohisch, an East Franconian dialect. Coat of arms Cities and municipalities
