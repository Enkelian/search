Joe Oriolo, who produced the TV Felix the Cat series, and Roger Carlin, previously an associate of Jay Ward, were involved in the company; along with Arthur P. Brooks and the colorfully named "Big Sid" Ginsberg. The cartoons were made in New York City, and employed a number of veteran artists (including freelancers and possibly moonlighters) connected with Paramount Pictures and Terrytoons cartoons. The company used stock music by Winston Sharples derived from his scores for Paramount cartoons of the 1950s, also heard in many other New York-made cartoons of the time.
