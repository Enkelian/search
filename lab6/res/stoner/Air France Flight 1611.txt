Air France Flight 1611
Air France Flight 1611 (AF1611) was a Sud Aviation SE-210 Caravelle III en route from the island of Corsica to Nice, France, on 11 September 1968 when it crashed into the Mediterranean Sea off Nice, killing all 95 on board. According to the official report, the crash was non-survivable. The crash is the deadliest aviation incident in the Mediterranean Sea to date. Among the dead was French general Ren√© Cogny. The probable cause was attributed to a fire which originated in the rear of the cabin. On 10 May 2011 Michel Laty, a former army typist, alleged on French television channel TF1 that he saw a report indicating a missile, misfired by the French army during a weapon test, in fact caused the crash.A 2019 article in The Guardian newspaper reported that after the crash, documents and photographs about it disappeared. The 11 September page in the log book for Le Suffren, a French Navy missile frigate in the area, was torn out. The aircraft's black box flight recorder was said to have been damaged, with the recording of flight AF1611 unreadable, although earlier flights were recorded. Wreckage recovered was seized by France's military. An investigation was started in 2011
