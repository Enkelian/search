History The newspaper was founded by Thomas Purvis Ritzema, a young newspaper manager, who purchased two shops at 19 and 21 Railway Road, Blackburn, for the launch of his venture. The first copy appeared on the streets on 26 October 1886, and sold for a haâ€™penny. It was known then as the Northern Daily Telegraph, and it was the first evening newspaper to be published in East Lancashire. In 1894, the head office was moved to the corner site of Railway Road and High Street. From 7 September 1939, soon after the start of World War II, advertisements gave way to news on the front page.
