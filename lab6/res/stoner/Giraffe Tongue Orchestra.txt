The band released their debut LP, Broken Lines on September 23, 2016. History The band was founded in 2012 by Ben Weinman. At one point actress and singer Juliette Lewis fronted it, and at another time featured Eric Avery on bass and Jon Theodore on drums. According to Weinman, Lewis never officially was the singer, but only added some vocal lines. The ten songs of the debut album Broken Lines had been written before DuVall came into the band. The group was called "a real democracy" by Weinman. On the song "Back to the Light" a vocal cameo of Lewis can be heard. The band had its first live appearances at Reading and Leeds Festivals on 27 and 28 August 2016.
