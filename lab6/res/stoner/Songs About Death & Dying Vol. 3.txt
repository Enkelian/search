Songs About Death & Dying Vol. 3
Songs About Death & Dying: Vol. 3 is the third studio album by American garage rock act Thee Oh Sees, released on May 30, 2005 on Narnack Records. Released under the name, OCS, the album was recorded as a duo by John Dwyer and drummer Patrick Mullins, and features experimental freak folk songs. The album was initially released as a double album, alongside the band's fourth studio album, OCS 4: Get Stoved, and was recorded as a side-project to Dwyer's then-primary band, Coachwhips. Reception In a positive review for Allmusic, Alex Henderson wrote: "Dwyer and colleague Patrick Mullins combine that folk-rock influence with bizarre, experimental electro-noise and a very muffled sound. It's a strange mixture, but a strangely appealing one - and most of the time, it works."
