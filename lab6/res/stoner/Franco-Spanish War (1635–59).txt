Franco-Spanish War (1635â€“59)
The Franco-Spanish War of 1635 to 1659 was one of a series of wars between France, and their Habsburg rivals in Spain and the Holy Roman Empire. It is considered a connected conflict of the 1568 to 1648 Dutch Revolt, and 1618 to 1648 Thirty Years War. Main areas of conflict included Northern Italy, the Spanish Netherlands, Catalonia, and the Rhineland, with both sides backing domestic conspiracies in the other. Spain financed Huguenot rebellions from 1622 to 1630, and the 1648 to 1653 civil war known as the Fronde; France supported revolts against Spanish rule in Portugal, Catalonia and Naples. The war consisted of two distinct phases; before 1635, France supported Habsburg opponents in the Dutch Revolt and Thirty Years War, but avoided direct involvement. After agreeing alliances with the Swedes and Dutch in 1635, it became a participant in both wars, which ended with the 1648 Peace of Westphalia. After 1648, fighting continued between Spain and France, with neither gaining an advantage. The 1657 Anglo-French alliance led to an offensive in Flanders, and victory at the June 1658 Battle of the Dunes. This did little to change the overall position, but the Spanish economy was severely impacted by English
