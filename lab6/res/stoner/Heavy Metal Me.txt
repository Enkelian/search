Heavy Metal Me
heavy metal me is a DVD release by Japanese band Boris. It consists of various live material, video material, and heavy metal me, a short film which is subtitled in both Japanese and English. The titular short film is actually a series of chapters on the disc which play in a random order every time the user hits play (though the chapters for each language remain together). Filmed primarily in black and white, the piece is deliberately low quality and aged, with guitarist Wata playing the lead; most chapters feature analog hiss and white noise for audio tracks, though some are totally silent, and others contain acoustic guitar plucks atop the hiss. The "a bao a qu" music video is based on the 7" version of the song with both sides crossfaded together into a 9-minute full length version; its video consists of extremely wide and narrow shots with low quality lighting, following several characters as they walk the streets, smoke, and reflect or contemplate. "the evil one which sobs" layers the titular song with its ambient counterpart "Interference Demon" from Dronevil, but starts the former several minutes later than the coupling of the CDs would play, and fades out
