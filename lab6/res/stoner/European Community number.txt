European Community number
The European Community number (EC number) is a unique seven-digit identifier that was assigned to substances for regulatory purposes within the European Union by the European Commission. The EC Inventory comprises three individual inventories, EINECS, ELINCS and the NLP list. Structure The EC number may be written in a general form as: NNN-NNN-R, where R is a check digit and N represents integers. The check digit is calculated using the ISBN method. According to this method, the check digit R is the following sum modulo 11: R = ( N 1 + 2 N 2 + 3 N 3 + 4 N 4 + 5 N 5 + 6 N 6 ) mod 1 1 {\displaystyle R=(N_{1}+2N_{2}+3N_{3}+4N_{4}+5N_{5}+6N_{6}){\bmod {1}}1} If the remainder R is equal to 10, that combination of digits is not used for an EC number. To illustrate, the EC number of dexamethasone is 200-003-9. N1 is 2, N2 through N5 are 0, and N6 is 3. 2 + 2 × 0 + 3 × 0 + 4 × 0 + 5 × 0 + 6 × 3 11 = 20 11 = 1 + 9 11 {\displaystyle {\frac {2+2\!\times \!0+3\!\times \!0+4\!\times \!0+5\!\times \!0+6\!\times \!3}{11}}={\frac {20}{11}}=1+{\frac {9}{11}}} The remainder
