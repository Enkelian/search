Ernst Strüngmann Institute
The Ernst Strüngmann Institute for Neuroscience in Cooperation with Max Planck Society (ESI) is an independent research institute financed by Andreas and Thomas Strüngmann, German entrepreneurs, and named after their father Dr. Ernst Strüngmann. The ESI is under the scientific governance of the Max Planck Society. It is located in Frankfurt am Main in Hesse. ESI-directors are Scientific Members of the Max Planck Society. ESI’s mission is to perform excellent fundamental brain research. ESI research focuses on understanding how the many parts of the brain work together to bring about our behaviour. Development In July 2008, a cooperation contract was signed between the Max Planck Society and Drs. Andreas and Thomas Strüngmann to found the ESI as an independent brain research institute with the format of a Max Planck Institute and adhering to the Max Planck excellence principles. On 12 September 2008, the ESI was formally founded, with the legal form of a nonprofit limited liability corporation (“gemeinnützige Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung (gGmbH)”). To finance the ESI, the Strüngmann brothers founded the Ernst Strüngmann Foundation (ESF). ESI’s founding directors are Wolf Singer and Pascal Fries. Mid July 2009, Prof. Fries became ESI’s first director and thereby ESI’s current managing director.
