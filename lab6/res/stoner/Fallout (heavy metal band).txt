Fallout (heavy metal band)
Fallout was a heavy metal band formed in 1979 based out of Brooklyn, New York, USA. The band contained future Type O Negative members Peter Steele (then billed under his birth name, Peter Ratajczyk) on bass and vocals and Josh Silver on keyboards, as well as John Campos on guitars and Agnostic Front drummer Louie Beateaux (then billed as Lou Beato) on drums. Fallout released only one record before the band's demise in 1982, the "Rock Hard" 7" single, released in 1981 on Silver Records and limited to 500 copies. This record was produced by Richard Termini and William Wittman. After three years of steady gigging, Fallout broke up.

John recorded, produced, and wrote songs for many independent and major label artists, such as Bret Reilly, Surfing Moses, Jennifer Marks, Alex Skolnick, the Tito Puente band, Jimmy Delgado, Fat Joe, Mink, and more. He now runs a studio and production company out of Astoria, New York called One Mind Music. Past members Peter Ratajczyk (Peter
