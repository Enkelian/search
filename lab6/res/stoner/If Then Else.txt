If Then Else
if_then_else is the sixth studio album by the Dutch alternative rock band The Gathering. The album was released on 25 July 2000 through Century Media. Background The album was recorded at the Koeienverhuurbedrijf Studio, Purmerend, and at S&K Studio, Doetinchem between January and March, 2000, under the band's own guidance with Zlaya Hadzich as co-producer. The album was engineered by Zlaya Hadzich and Dick Kemper, mixed and mastered on Pro Tools by Attie Bauw at Bauwhaus Studio, Amsterdam in April 2000. Its title combines two frequently used computer programming notations: The if, then, else conditional statement The use of all lowercase, underscore-separated words"Colorado Incident" is about a real-life experience of having to cancel a gig in Colorado because of overbooking, exhaustion and the band members' illnesses. Fans were frustrated, and the band was later very apologetic about this "incident". (It is apparently not about the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, as often speculated.) An excerpt of Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland is heard between "Analog Park" and "Herbal Movement".
