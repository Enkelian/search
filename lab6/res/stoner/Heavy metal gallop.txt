A gallop is a beat or rhythm typically used in traditional heavy metal songs. It is created by playing an eighth note followed by two sixteenth notes (), usually on rhythm guitar or drum kit.

Variations include the triplet gallop and the reverse gallop.On drums, the technique often uses a double kick pedal.
