"Revolution" is a song on the album Angel of Retribution, by the heavy metal band Judas Priest. It was their first single since 1992's "Night Crawler" to enter in the United States charts. It reached No. 23 in the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. According to the producer, Roy Z: The bass intro to 'Revolution' is actually from a cassette tape the band recorded back in the 1970s.
