Airbus A330neo
The Airbus A330neo ("neo" for "New Engine Option") is a wide-body jet airliner developed by Airbus from the Airbus A330 (now A330ceo â€“ "Current Engine Option"). A new version with modern engines comparable to those developed for the Boeing 787 was called for by owners of the current A330. It was launched on 14 July 2014 at the Farnborough Airshow, promising 14% better fuel economy per seat. It exclusively uses the larger Rolls-Royce Trent 7000. Its two versions are based on the A330-200 and -300: the -800 has a range of 8,150 nmi (15,090 km) with 257 passengers while the -900 covers 7,200 nmi (13,330 km) with 287 passengers. The -900 made its maiden flight on 19 October 2017 and received its EASA type certificate on 26 September 2018. It was first delivered to TAP Air Portugal on 26 November and had its maiden commercial flight on 15 December. The -800 made its first flight on 6 November 2018 and received EASA type certification on 13 February 2020.
