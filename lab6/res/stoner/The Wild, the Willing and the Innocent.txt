The Wild, the Willing and the Innocent
The Wild, the Willing and the Innocent is the ninth studio album by the British hard rock band UFO and the first to be entirely self-produced by the band. The song "Lonely Heart" was a minor UK hit single. The original cover was as usual designed by the art studio Hipgnosis. This is the band's first album with the former Wild Horses' keyboard player Neil Carter, replacing Paul Raymond, who had left to join the Michael Schenker Group. The album was remastered at Sound Recording Technology in Cambridge in 1994 and re-issued on Repertoire Records. The album was also reissued in 2009, remastered with an expanded booklet and bonus tracks. In 2016, Eddie Trunk selected the album as one of The 11 Records That Changed My Life for Classic Rock (magazine).
