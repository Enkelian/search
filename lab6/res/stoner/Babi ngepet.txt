Babi ngepet
Babi Ngepet (Indonesian pronunciation: [babi ŋɛpɛt]) is a boar demon in Indonesian mythology. Outline According to local myth, the creature is believed to be the manifestation of a person practising pesugihan babi black magic. Pesugihan is derived from the Javanese word sugih meaning "rich". It is a kind of magic to help people become rich instantly, but in exchange they must sacrifice something. In this case they must sacrifice their humanity; allowing themselves to be transformed into a boar for a period of time, or allowing themselves to be possessed by a boar demon. The human-animal transformation is similar to shapeshifting or the werewolf concept in the West. Transformation Some of the myths told about a man enveloped in black robes before miraculously turning into this creature. After the transformation, the demon boar roams around the village, scratching its body against the wall, door, cupboard, or furniture. Magically the belongings of the villagers, such as money, gold, and jewellery will disappear and be magically carried away by the Babi Ngepet. If the mission was successful, by the time Babi Ngepet safely returns home and transforms back into their human form, the black robes will be filled with the stolen money
