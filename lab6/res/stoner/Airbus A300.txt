Airbus A300
The Airbus A300 is a discontinued wide-body airliner developed and manufactured by Airbus. In September 1967, aircraft manufacturers in the UK, France, and West Germany signed a Memorandum of Understanding to develop a large airliner. Germany and France reached an agreement on 29 May 1969 after the British withdrew from the project on 10 April 1969. European collaborative aerospace manufacturer Airbus Industrie was formally created on 18 December 1970 to develop and produce it. The prototype first flew on 28 October 1972. The first twin-engine widebody airliner typically seats 247 passengers in two classes over a range of 5,375 to 7,500 km (2,900 to 4,050 nmi). Initial variants are powered by CF6-50 or JT9D turbofans and have a three-crew flight deck. The improved A300-600 has a two-crew cockpit and updated GE CF6-80 or PW4000 engines, it made its first flight on 8 July 1983 and entered service later that year. The A300 is the basis of the smaller A310 (first flight: 1982) and was adapted in a freighter version. Its cross section was retained for the larger A340 (1991) and A330 (1992). It is also the basis for the oversize Beluga transport (1994). Launch customer Air France introduced the type
