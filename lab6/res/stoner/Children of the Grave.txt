Children of the Grave
"Children of the Grave" is a song by British heavy metal band Black Sabbath, from their 1971 album Master of Reality. The song lyrically continues with the same anti-war themes brought on by "War Pigs" and "Electric Funeral" from Paranoid, adding in Geezer Butler's pacifist ideals of non-violent civil disobedience. Two previously unreleased versions of this song are released on the deluxe edition of Master of Reality. The first is a version with alternate lyrics, the second an instrumental version.The song has been featured on several greatest hits and live albums. As well as being performed by Black Sabbath in concert in its various incarnations, Ozzy Osbourne performed it in concert many times as a solo artist. It appears in the video game Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock as a playable song. It was also referenced in the online game League of Legends as the name of the ultimate attack of the metal-themed character Mordekaiser before his rework, and is the background music for the opening level of the video game Br√ºtal Legend.
