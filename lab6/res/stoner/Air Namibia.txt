Air Namibia
Air Namibia (Pty) Limited, which trades as Air Namibia, is the national airline of Namibia, headquartered in the country’s capital, Windhoek. It operates scheduled domestic, regional, and international passenger and cargo services, having its international hub in Windhoek Hosea Kutako International Airport and a domestic hub at the smaller Windhoek Eros Airport. As of December 2013, the carrier is wholly owned by the Namibian government. Air Namibia is a member of both the International Air Transport Association and the African Airlines Association. History The origins of the airline trace back to November 1946 (1946-11), when South West Air Transport (SWAT) was established. Using Ryan Navion aircraft, this carrier started operations in 1949 linking Windhoek with Grootfontein. Charter and cargo flights were also undertaken. In 1950, the company started feeder services for South African Airways. By 1958, a fleet of seven Ryan Navions and one de Havilland Dragon Rapide served a route network that included Grootfontein, Tsumeb, Otjiwarongo, Outjo, Swakopmund, Walvis Bay and Windhoek. On 26 March 1959, SWAT merged with Oryx Aviation — a small passenger airline established three years earlier— to form South West Airways (Afrikaans: Suidwes Lugdiens). IATA membership was gained later that year.Two Cessna 205s were purchased,
