Born in Coventry, he is best known for producing The Moody Blues from 1966 to 1979. Biography Clarke played bass guitar in skiffle bands in the middle and late 1950s, and continued playing in rock bands into the early 1960s. Alongside this, he found work as a session musician for Decca Records, and in 1963 he was hired by the label as a promoter. In 1964 he transferred to the production department, working under Dick Rowe. Most of his early work was spent on clerical and discographical tasks, though he also worked as a songwriter; his tune "Our Song" was recorded by Malcolm Roberts (who had a hit with it in South America) and Jack Jones. He produced his first single with Pinkerton's Assorted Colours; that song, "Mirror, Mirror", became a #9 hit on the UK Singles Chart. He wrote "The Guy Who Made Her A Star" for The Equals, featured on the B-side of the band's 1968 hit single, "Laurel And Hardy". He was assigned to work with The Moody Blues starting in 1966, when the group was fading
