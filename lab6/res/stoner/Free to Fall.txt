Free to Fall
"Free to Fall" is a 1987 song by the American vocalist Debbie Harry, taken from her second solo album Rockbird (1986). It was released as the second single in the U.S. and the UK. Suffering from lack of record company promotion, the single failed to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 or any other significant U.S. chart, and peaked at no.46 in the UK. The B-side to the single, "Feel the Spin", was a previous U.S. dance hit from the soundtrack to the film Krush Groove. The line "...sinking in the sea of love" was used previously in a Blondie song, "Man Overboard", from the album Blondie (1976).
