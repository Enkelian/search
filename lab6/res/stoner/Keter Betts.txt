Keter Betts
William Thomas "Keter" Betts (July 22, 1928 â€“ August 6, 2005) was an American jazz double bassist. Born in Port Chester, New York, he was nicknamed "Keter", a short form of the word mosquito. Career Many better-known musicians (Dinah Washington, Ella Fitzgerald, Oscar Peterson, Nat Adderley, Stan Getz, Charlie Byrd and others), recognizing Betts's talent, invited him to perform with them professionally. Early in Betts's career he had played with Earl Bostic's R&B band. In 1962, together with Stan Getz and Charlie Byrd, he was instrumental in introducing the bossa nova style to American audiences via their Jazz Samba recording. In the mid-1960s, Betts began a nearly quarter-century relationship as a bassist with Ella Fitzgerald. Betts never recorded as a session leader. Personal life A widowed father of five children, Betts resided in the Washington, DC, area for more than a half century. He died at his home in Silver Spring, Maryland, in August 2005.
