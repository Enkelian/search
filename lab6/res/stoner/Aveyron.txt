Aveyron
Aveyron (French: [avɛʁɔ̃] (listen); Occitan: Avairon; [aβajˈɾu]) is a department located in Occitanie region of Southern France. Named after the Aveyron River, it had a population of 278,697 in 2016. Its inhabitants are known as Aveyronnais or Aveyronnaises in French. The inhabitants of Rodez are called Ruthénois, based on the first Celtic settlers in the area, the Ruteni. History Aveyron is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790. The first known historical inhabitants of the region were the Rutenii tribe, but the area was inhabited previously to this, boasting many prehistoric ruins including over 1,000 dolmens, more than any other department in France. During the medieval and early modern periods, and until the 1790s, the territory covered by Aveyron was a province known as Rouergue. In 1797, Victor of Aveyron (the Feral child of Aveyron) was found wandering the woods in the area. The story of Victor is told in the film The Wild Child. In 1817, a local prosecutor, Antoine Bernardin Fualdès, was assassinated. The sordid circumstances of his death, following which his body was found floating in the Aveyron River, led to the matter becoming publicised as a cause célèbre.
