Alpes-de-Haute-Provence (French: [alp də ot pʁɔvɑ̃s] (listen); Occitan: Aups d'Auta Provença; lit. '"Alps of Upper Provence"') is a department in Southeastern France, located in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region. Formerly part of the province of Provence, it had a population of 161,916 in 2013. Its main cities are Digne-les-Bains (prefecture), Manosque, Sisteron, Barcelonnette, Castellane and Forcalquier. Inhabitants of Alpes-de-Haute-Provence are called the Bas-Alpins or Bas-Alpines referring to the department of Basses-Alpes which was the former name of the department until 1970. Geography Bounded in the east by Italy, the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence department is surrounded by the departments of Alpes-Maritimes, Var, Vaucluse, Drôme, and Hautes-Alpes. It can be divided into three zones depending on the terrain, climate, population, and economy: the plateaux, hills and valleys of Haute-Provence, which comprise one-third of the area but two thirds of the population and the most important cities of the department with almost all of the economic activity apart from mountain tourism. The valley of the Durance, the artery of the department, cuts the rest of the department into two halves: the Lower Alps: an intermediate mountain area with valleys and very remote villages the High Alps: including the valleys of Ubaye, Blanche, and the high Verdon
