Star Fleet (song)
"Star Fleet" is the first single that Brian May released independently of Queen and is taken from the end theme of the cult science fiction puppet series Star Fleet. It was taken from the mini-album Star Fleet Project, which started out as a jam session involving May, Eddie Van Halen, drummer Alan Gratzer, bassist Phil Chen and keyboardist Fred Mandel over the days 21 and 22 April 1983.Aside from the main participants, the title track also included backing vocals by Queen drummer Roger Taylor. The main track, "Star Fleet", was edited down from the mini-album's length of eight minutes to a more radio-friendly 4:12. Shorter edits were also done for Argentinian and American promo releases. The British B-side, "Son Of Star Fleet" is an instrumental version of "Star Fleet". Track listing UK 7" Single "Star Fleet" (Single Version) (Bliss/Arr. May) 4:12 "Son of Star Fleet" (Bliss/Arr.
