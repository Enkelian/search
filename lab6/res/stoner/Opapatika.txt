Opapatika
Opapatika (Thai: โอปปาติก เกิดอมตะ) is a 2007 Thai fantasy-action film. It is directed by Thanakorn Pongsuwan and stars Pongpat Wachirabanjong, Leo Putt, Somchai Kemklad, Chakrit Yaemnam, Ray MacDonald, Athip Nana, Nirut Sirijanya and Khemupsorn Sirisukha Plot A narrator explains that according to Buddhist belief the evolution of birth can be divided into three forms: Sangsethaca: To be born amongst rot and decay, as a worm or maggot. Anthaca: To be born from an egg, in the various forms of birds. Chalaphucha: To be conceived in the womb as a human or other mammal.Then there is a fourth form, Opapatika, which goes against Buddhist beliefs because it involves suicide: a class of supernatural beings who are born out of suicide. However, the powers that they gain also have a negative effect. The narrator, it is revealed, is Thuwachit (Pongpat Wachirabanjong), the loyal mortal henchman for the elderly Sadok (Nirut Sirijanya), an Opapatika who is quickly decaying and needs to feast on the flesh of other Opapatikas in order to sustain himself. He sends Thuwachit out to capture others. Four Opapatikas remain: Paisol (Chakrit Yaemnam), a ruthless assassin who must bear all the scars and wounds of his victims. Jiras (Somchai Khemklad),
