Zeltweg Air Base
Zeltweg Air Base, now known as Fliegerhorst Hinterstoisser, is a military airfield in Styria, Austria near Zeltweg. It is the main airfield of the Austrian Air Force. It was also used as a motor racing circuit in the 1960s. History The planning of an airfield in the middle of Styria was in 1935. A year later construction works carried on and in the late 1937 the first unit, the Schulgeschwader, was based in Zeltweg. On 13 March 1938 the airfield was handed over to the German Luftwaffe. They used the station as an instructor Base for twin-engine aircraft (e.g. Ju88, Ju86, Do17). In the last months of the World War 2 the Jagdgeschader 300 was stationed before the Ukraine Army occupied the region. The airfield was later handed back to the British Government and the 26. Infantry Division and the Royal Air Force was stationed here. In the year 1955 RAF Station Zeltweg closed and the airfield was transferred back to Austria. After starting up with der Austrian Armed Forces one of the first Infantry unit were located. During 1956 the first troops of the Austrian Air Force were stationed here.
