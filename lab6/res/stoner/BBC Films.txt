Prior to 2007, it was based nearby in Mortimer Street, while still under full control of the BBC. A restructuring of the division integrated it into the main BBC Fiction department of BBC Vision. As a result, it moved out of its independent offices into BBC Television Centre, and its head David M. Thompson left to start his own film production company.
