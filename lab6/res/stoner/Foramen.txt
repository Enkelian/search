Foramen
In anatomy, a foramen (; plural foramina, or foramens ) is any opening. Foramina inside the body of humans and other animals typically allow muscles, nerves, arteries, veins, or other structures to connect one part of the body with another. Skull The skulls of vertebrates (including humans) have foramina through which nerves, arteries, veins and other structures pass. Spine Within the vertebral column (spine) of vertebrates, including the human spine, each bone has an opening at both its top and bottom to allow nerves, arteries, veins, etc. to pass through.
