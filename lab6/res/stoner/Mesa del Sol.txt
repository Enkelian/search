It is bounded by the Albuquerque International Sunport along the northwestern edge, Kirtland Air Force Base on the north and east sides, the Isleta Reservation to the south, and Interstate 25 to the west. Master plan Mesa del Sol's master plan called for development over a 40-year span that would cover 9,000 acres of the 12,900-acre site. The remaining 3,200 acres was proposed for parks and open space. The project expected to house 100,000 people, with a downtown area, 37,500 homes, 18,000,000 sq ft (1,700,000 m2) of office space, 4,400 acres (18 km2) for residential and supporting retail, 800 acres (3.2 km2) for schools including university branches. The master plan also included a new interchange providing access to Interstate 25 that would be financed as part of the development.
