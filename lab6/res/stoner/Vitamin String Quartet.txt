Vitamin String Quartet
Vitamin String Quartet (VSQ) is a musical group from Los Angeles, California, that is widely known for its series of tribute albums to rock and pop acts. Vitamin String Quartet, or VSQ, is not a string quartet in the traditional sense. Rather, VSQ is a series of string quartet projects developed and produced by CMH Label Group, an independent record company based in Los Angeles. The CMH team works with an ever-evolving cast of arrangers, producers, string players and other creatives to bring each project to life. Their albums are released through Vitamin Records and primarily performed by a string quartet, though other instruments have been used. "Vitamin String Quartet is about applying rock n' roll attitude to classical technique," says Tom Tally, a violist and arranger who has performed on and produced over fifty Vitamin String Quartet albums. Their albums honor a wide variety of genres, including pop and rock, metal, emo, punk, techno, country, and hip-hop, and a wide variety of groups, such as Oasis, Simple Plan, Queen, Led Zeppelin, The Offspring, Michael Jackson, The Beatles, Senses Fail, Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, Bruce Springsteen, Jimi Hendrix, The Smashing Pumpkins, Radiohead, Modest Mouse, System of a Down, The Killers,
