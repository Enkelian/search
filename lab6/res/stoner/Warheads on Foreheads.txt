Bandleader Dave Mustaine selected and compiled 35 tracks, choosing at least one track from each of the band's fifteen studio albums. He stated, "I see these songs as the most efficient weapons in the band's arsenal...These tracks were created for maximum destruction."The album was released as 3-CD and 4-LP vinyl editions, as well as a 4-LP vinyl edition on silver-colored vinyl. Both versions feature the same track listing. Critical reception The compilation was generally well received by critics.
