Bandai Namco Entertainment, Inc. is a Japanese multinational video game developer and publisher, headquartered in Minato-ku, Tokyo. Its international branches, Bandai Namco Entertainment America and Bandai Namco Entertainment Europe, are respectively headquartered in Santa Clara, California and Lyon, France. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Bandai Namco Holdings. Bandai Namco Entertainment was formed on March 31, 2006, following a corporate merge between Namco and Bandai on September 29 of the previous year. Originally known as Namco Bandai Games, they merged both Bandai Games and Namco Networks in January to create a North America division, Namco Bandai Games America. Namco Bandai Games absorbed Banpresto's video game division in 2008, and dissolving Bandai Networks in 2009. Development operations were spun-off into a new company in 2012, Namco Bandai Studios, to help create faster development time and tighter cohesion between development teams. The company was renamed to Bandai Namco Games in 2014 and Bandai Namco Entertainment, their current name, in 2015. Bandai Namco Entertainment produces several multi-million-selling video game franchises, including Pac-Man, Galaxian, Gundam, Tales, Tekken, Soulcalibur, Ace Combat and Taiko no Tatsujin, and is the third largest video game publisher in Japan by revenue and the seventh in the world.
