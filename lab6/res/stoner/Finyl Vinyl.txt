Finyl Vinyl
Finyl Vinyl is a collection of live recordings and B-sides by the British hard rock band Rainbow and was released in 1986, after the band had already disbanded in 1984. All the studio tracks had previously been released. Notes The cover photograph of Ritchie Blackmore was taken by Ross Halfin after a concert at the Deutschlandhalle in Berlin in November 1982. The LP notes mistakenly credit drums on "Weiss Heim" to Bobby Rondinelli, when in fact they were performed by Cozy Powell. The instrumental "Difficult to Cure" is taken from the final Japanese Rainbow date in 1984 and features a full orchestral accompaniment. The guitar solo was re-recorded and differs from the video release. The song "Man on the Silver Mountain" features guitar overdubs. The song "Can't Happen Here" has wrong location and date in the booklet. It was actually recorded at "The Orpheum Theatre" in Boston, MA, USA on 07-05-1981. The original double vinyl release omitted "Street of Dreams", although it was included on the cassette version before "Jealous Lover". The first CD issue, a single disc, omitted both "Street of Dreams" and "Tearin' Out My Heart". These were restored on the 2CD remastered edition of 1999, which features
