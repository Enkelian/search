Go the Distance
"Go the Distance" is a song from Disney's 1997 animated feature film, Hercules. It was written by composer Alan Menken and lyricist David Zippel, and originally recorded by American actor Roger Bart in his film role as the singing voice of Hercules. American singer-songwriter Michael Bolton recorded a pop version of the song for the film's end credits. In the Spanish version, the song is performed by Hercules voice actor Ricky Martin, both in the movie and in the credits; this version is included on Martin's album Vuelve. Both the song and its reprise featured in a stage production of Hercules, performed upon the Disney Wonder during 2007/2008. Production "Go the Distance" was one of two songs written for Hercules in the film, the second being "Shooting Star", which failed to make the final cut. However, "Shooting Star" is included on the Hercules soundtrack CD, sung by Boyzone. The score for the original version of the song can be found in the Alan Menken Songbook. Critical reception Ways of Being Male felt that the phrase "go the distance" is a prime example of the way themes are "couched in the language of sport and competition" throughout the film. Den of
