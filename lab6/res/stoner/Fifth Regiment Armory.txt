Fifth Regiment Armory is a historic National Guard armory located at Baltimore, Maryland, United States. It is an imposing, fortress-type structure situated in midtown Baltimore. It consists of a full basement, a first floor containing a 200 foot by 300 foot drill hall, a mezzanine or "balcony" level, and a newer second level (reconstructed in 1933 after a fire) housing the trussed steel drill hall roof. The fa√ßade features buttresses, parapets, casement windows, and a crenellated roofline, giving the appearance of a medieval fortification. It was the site of the 1912 Democratic National Convention. The Fifth Regiment Armory was designed by architects Wyatt & Nolting. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. It is included within the Baltimore National Heritage Area.On October 31, 1958, President Dwight Eisenhower delivered a televised speech from the Fifth Regiment Armory.
