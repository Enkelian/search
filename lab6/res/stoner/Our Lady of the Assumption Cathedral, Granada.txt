Our Lady of the Assumption Cathedral, Granada
The Our Lady of the Assumption Cathedral (Spanish: Catedral de Nuestra Señora de la Asunción) also called Granada Cathedral is a neoclassical Catholic cathedral located in Granada, Nicaragua, roughly 25 miles southeast of Managua. The church is the main temple of the Diocese of Granada, and its bishop is Jorge Solórzano Pérez. The first cathedral temple was built around 1525 with tapicel and rafaz stone, brick, lime and straw roof. By 1578, the church had already been burned twice. Seven years later, in 1585, it started to become known colloquially as "La Iglesia Bonita," or "The Beautiful Church." The second temple was completed in about 1751 with lime, stone, and brick. In 1916, the iron frame intended for the central dome was brought from the United States, only three years after the Diocese of Granada was created by the Roman Catholic Church. The cathedral as it stands today was completed in its entirety in 1972, with a total area of 3,614.87 m².
