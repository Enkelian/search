Song information Love Buzz Circa Survive vocalist Anthony Green said the band picked "Love Buzz" because it was the first Nirvana song he ever heard and elaborated: "It's simple but hits so hard. I remember listening to it and feeling like 'I could do this' because of how accessible it felt." School Basement vocalist Andrew Fisher said his band picked "School" because of how simple and heavy yet dynamic it was, and elaborated: "We flirted with the idea of trying to make it 'our own' and change it, but because the song is so simple everything we came up with sounded forced and wrong. Instead we thought we'd try our best to do the song justice and so recorded it live and tried to keep it as true to the original as possible."
