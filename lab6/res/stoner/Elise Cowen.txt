Elise Cowen
Elise Nada Cowen (July 31, 1933 â€“ February 27, 1962,) was an American poet. She was part of the Beat generation, and was close to Allen Ginsberg, one of the movement's leading figures. Background Born to a middle-class Jewish family in Washington Heights, New York, Cowen wrote poetry from a young age, influenced by the works of Emily Dickinson, T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, and Dylan Thomas. While attending Barnard College in the early 1950s, she became friends with Joyce Johnson (at the time, Joyce Glassman). It was during this period that she was introduced to Ginsberg by psychology professor Donald Cook. The two discovered a mutual acquaintance in Carl Solomon, whom they had both met while spending time separately in a mental hospital. A romantic involvement followed in the spring and summer of 1953. However, within a year, Ginsberg would meet and fall in love with Peter Orlovsky, his eventual life partner. Despite this, Cowen remained emotionally attached to Ginsberg for the rest of her life. Cowen is most famous for typing "Kaddish" for Allen Ginsberg, after which she observed, "You still haven't finished with your mother." She discovered Jewish mysticism and Buddhism through Ginsberg, which influenced her poetry.In
