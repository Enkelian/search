Troy Gregory
Troy Gregory (born November 13, 1966 in Detroit, Michigan) is a singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, filmmaker, and solo artist.

In a 2016 interview that was featured on No Echo, Gregory explained how he came to join Flotsam and Jetsam: I had graduated from Musicians Institute and just got fired from working in their library. I was walking to a comic book shop on Melrose and saw Dave Mustaine walking into Music Grinder Studios. I heard Chuck Behler joined them on drums and I had played with him twice in Detroit, so I knocked on the door to say hi. He suggested me to join Flotsam. They had the same management and were going to tour together.
