Their second effort, Becoming i, was released on March 11, 2003, and was produced by Andrew Murdock – responsible for Powerman 5000, Godsmack, and Chimaira, among other artists. During said year, the band toured with such household names as Korn, opened for Music as a Weapon II, and appeared at Ozzfest 2003.

Since then, guitarist Marc Serrano joined the now disbanded A Dozen Furies, drummer Pete Navarrete formed a band called Exit the Sun, and vocalist Joey Dueñas formed a band called Anew Revolution, featuring members from Slaves on Dope.
