Saint Mary's Hall (SMH) is a private, college preparatory school in San Antonio, Texas. Saint Mary's Hall admits students from Montessori (age 3) to Form 12 (age 18). History 1860 - 1889 The Episcopal Diocese of Texas, under the leadership of several bishops, worked to establish schools at the parish level where the children of South Texas would be able to receive a “higher style of education” with "Godly training." The attempts to establish a school of this sort began as early as 1865 when an Episcopal school was opened. The school took on several names such as Saint Mary's School for Girls, Saint Mary's Episcopal School, Saint Mary's School, and Saint Mary's Academy Hall. Eventually, the school failed, but it left a strong need for a preparatory school.The quest to establish that school became very important to Bishop Robert Woodward Barnwell Elliott, the dynamic leader of the Missionary District of Western Texas of the Episcopal Church. In 1879, he led a movement to reestablish the school. His efforts would prove successful, and the school officially became known as Saint Mary's Hall. The first official home of the school was located in the Wolfe Building at the corner of Navarro
