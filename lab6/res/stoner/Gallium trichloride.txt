Gallium trichloride
Gallium trichloride is the chemical compound with the formula GaCl3. Solid gallium trichloride exists as a dimer with the formula Ga2Cl6. It is colourless and soluble in virtually all solvents, even alkanes, which is truly unusual for a metal halide. It is the main precursor to most derivatives of gallium and a reagent in organic synthesis.As a Lewis acid, GaCl3 is milder than aluminium trichloride. Gallium(III) is easier to reduce than Al(III), so the chemistry of reduced gallium compounds is more extensive than for aluminium. Ga2Cl4 is known whereas the corresponding Al2Cl4 is not. The coordination chemistry of Ga(III) and Fe(III) are similar, and gallium(III) compounds have been used as diamagnetic analogues of ferric compounds. Preparation Gallium trichloride can be prepared from the elements, heating gallium metal in a stream of chlorine, and purifying the product by sublimation under vacuum. 2 Ga + 3 Cl2 → 2 GaCl3It can also be prepared from by heating gallium oxide with thionyl chloride: Ga2O3 + 3 SOCl2 → 2 GaCl3 + 3 SO2Gallium metal reacts slowly with hydrochloric acid. This reaction produces hydrogen gas slowly. Structure As a solid, it adopts a bitetrahedral structure with two bridging chlorides. Its structure resembles that of
