Nipple/Areola prostheses (prostheses is the plural of prosthesis) are made of silicone by breast prosthesis manufacturers and anaplastologists for breast cancer survivors who were treated for breast cancer with a mastectomy. Prostheses can be worn weeks after a mastectomy, breast reconstruction, or even nipple reconstruction. As an inexpensive and convenient alternative to surgery, patients may choose to wear them anytime during treatment. Patients who ultimately find nipple prostheses thought that they should be informed of them during the consultation prior to mastectomy (Janes S 2005). Fabrication Nipple prosthetics are made of silicone and are adhered to the skin. There are several different types of prostheses with different benefits and costs. Mass-produced and “semi-custom” prostheses allow women to choose from a few colors and sizes. The majority of mass-produced prostheses are self-adhering and last three months because the materials are weaker and the adhesion become weaker. Lack of projection, color match, shape, size, and texture are all among the common complaints of mass-produced prostheses (Sainsbury R 1991). Despite these complaints, mass-produced prostheses have shown some benefit. When given to patients for a three-month period between breast mount reconstruction and surgical NAC reconstruction, some patients actually preferred using the prostheses for dress
