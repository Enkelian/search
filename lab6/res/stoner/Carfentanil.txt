Carfentanil
Carfentanil or carfentanyl is a structural analog of the synthetic opioid analgesic fentanyl.Carfentanil was first synthesized in 1974 by a team of chemists at Janssen Pharmaceutica which included Paul Janssen.The effects of carfentanil, including overdose, can be reversed by naloxone.Carfentanil is legally controlled in most jurisdictions, but has veterinary uses for anaesthetising large animals. Typical use Carfentanil was sold starting in 1986 under the brand name "Wildnil" for use in tranquilizer darts in combination with an α2-adrenoreceptor agonist for large mammals including elk and elephants. It was chosen for its high therapeutic index. Commercial production of Wildnil ceased in 2003, and the drug is available only as a compounded dosage form.Radiolabelled [11C]carfentanil is widely used as a selective radiotracer in animal and human positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies of the μ-opioid system due to its high affinity for receptors. Modern history Increase in illicit use A November 2016 article in Time, "Heroin Is Being Laced With a Terrifying New Substance: What to Know About Carfentanil", reports over 300 cases of overdose related to fentanyl and fentanyl analogues and several deaths connected to the drug since August 2016 in several of the United States, including Ohio, West Virginia, Indiana, Kentucky
