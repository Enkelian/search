One A.M. (album)
One A.M. is the first studio album by American rapper Diverse. It was released on Chocolate Industries in 2003. The album features production by RJD2, Prefuse73, Madlib, and Jeff Parker. Guest appearances include Vast Aire, Lyrics Born, and Jean Grae. Reception Steve Huey of AllMusic gave the album 4 stars out of 5, calling it "[a] thoroughly excellent debut." He said, "Diverse's greatest strength as a rapper is his flow, as he spins a dense web of painstakingly constructed language over the beats as though he were spreading soft butter on toast."Gabe Gloden of Stylus Magazine gave the album a grade of Aâˆ’, saying: "There's not one dud to be found on One A.M., and at a lean 42 minutes, Diverse deserves at least that much of your time." Noel Dix of Exclaim! said: "Along with Vast Aire of Cannibal Ox and the mighty Jean Grae, there is simply far too much talent on this effort to go unnoticed."
