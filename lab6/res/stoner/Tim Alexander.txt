Tim Alexander
Timothy W. "Tim" Alexander (born April 10, 1965 in Cherry Point, North Carolina) is an American musician best known as the drummer for the rock band Primus. Alexander played on Primus recordings from Suck on This to Tales from the Punchbowl, before leaving the band in 1996, only to rejoin in 2003 for the EP Animals Should Not Try to Act Like People. Alexander left the band for a second time in 2010, only to rejoin again in 2013. Alexander is hailed frequently for his "polyrhythmic" playing. Biography Before Primus, Alexander played and recorded with Major Lingo, which at the time was a ska-based rhythm band that featured a lap steel guitar as the lead instrument, played by Tony Bruno. Alexander got the job with Primus replacing Jay Lane (along with Larry LaLonde who replaced Todd Huth) in 1988, and lasted until 1996. Alexander's second stint with Primus was from early 2003 until approximately 2009 when he was replaced by Jay Lane. Les Claypool spoke of Alexander's playing in an interview with Bass Player: "[He] is a very precise player. Even when we're really stretching on something, you can rarely tell that we're still a band that doesn't rehearse much.
