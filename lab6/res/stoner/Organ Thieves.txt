Organ Thieves
Organ Thieves is a southern and soul-influenced experimental hard rock side project by Brown Brigade guitarists Chuck Coles and Dave Baksh, formed by Coles in mid-2008. It has since become their main project. History Formation and God's Favorite Sons (2008â€“2009) According to Dave Baksh the band "started when guitarist Chuck Coles was getting kind of antsy in Brown Brigade in that he wanted to write- he's a natural songwriter. So one day we were set to play a benefit show in Kitchener/Waterloo but Chuck had already booked an Organ Thieves show, and this is at the time when he was using another drummer other than Johnny [Chuck's former Cauterize co-member Matt Worobec]. Basically I hadn't even seen the band and they asked me to play a Labour Day show with them. After about two weeks of practice me and the drummer at the time, Matt Worobec, had gotten together and played this show. The lineup would have been Ben Davies, Mikesmith, Matt Worobec, Chuck Coles and myself. We pretty much played naked to a bunch of people at a cottage; it was fun." Dave also stated that he joined the band due to the different members and their musical tastes
