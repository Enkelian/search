Northeast Los Angeles
Northeast Los Angeles is a 17.18-square-mile region of Los Angeles County, comprising seven neighborhoods within the City of Los Angeles. The area is home to Occidental College located in Eagle Rock. History The bulk of the area closer to Pueblo de Los Angeles-Downtown Los Angeles was part of the original Spanish and Mexican land grants of Rancho San Rafael and Rancho San Pascual when the city incorporated in 1850. One of the first annexations of the city was Highland Park in 1895. Other nearby communities attached to Los Angeles were Garvanza (1899), Arroyo Seco (1912) and Eagle Rock (1923). Development in the Northeast was fostered by service of the Los Angeles Railway "Yellow Cars."
