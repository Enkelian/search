Drop C tuning
Drop C tuning is an alternative guitar tuning where at least one string has been lowered to a C, but most commonly refers to CGCFAD, which can be described as D tuning with a 6th string dropped to C, or drop D tuning transposed down a whole step. Because of its heavier tone, it is most commonly used in rock and heavy metal music. Variations CGDGBE – Dropping the low E string to a C, and the A string to a G, to make a fifth chord. The rest of the strings remain the same. CADGBE – This is achieved by taking standard tuning (EADGBE), and dropping the low E to a C. All other strings remain in standard tuning.
