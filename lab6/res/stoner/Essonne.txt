Essonne
Essonne (pronounced [ɛsɔn]) is a French department in the region of Île-de-France. It is named after the Essonne River. It was formed on 1 January 1968 when Seine-et-Oise was split into smaller departments. History The Essonne department was created on 1 January 1968, from the southern portion of the former department of Seine-et-Oise. In June 1963 Carrefour S.A. opened the first hypermarket in the Paris region at Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois (although the word "hypermarché" was first used only in 1966). Based on the ideas put forward by the American logistics pioneer Bernardo Trujillo, the centre offered on a single 2,500 m2 (26,909.78 sq ft) site a hitherto unknown combination of wide choice and low prices, supported by 400 car parking spaces. In 1969, the communes of Châteaufort and Toussus-le-Noble were separated from Essonne and added to the department of Yvelines. Geography Essonne belongs to the region of Île-de-France.
