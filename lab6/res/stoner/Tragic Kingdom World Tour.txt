Tragic Kingdom World Tour
The Tragic Kingdom World Tour was the first concert tour by American alternative band No Doubt. It started in Nashville, Tennessee on September 6, 1995, and later concluded on November 8, 1997, in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The show in Anaheim, California on June 1, 1997, was recorded and later released as the DVD Live in the Tragic Kingdom. The band expected to tour for two months, but the tour ended up lasting two and a half years. Production Luc Lafortune and Michael Keeling of Project X were behind the tour's stage design. The band suggested decorating the stage as a clearing in a forest. Project X created three anthropomorphic trees with glowing oranges. The show included clear and mylar confetti designed to look like rain. Lighting design was difficult because there were only four rehearsals, so the show was arranged to be flexible to allow for what Lafortune referred to as "a very kinetic performance."
