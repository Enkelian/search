The idea was to slow down and channel tanks into killing zones where they could easily be disposed of by anti-tank weapons. They were employed extensively, particularly on the Siegfried Line.

Typically, each "tooth" was 90 to 120 cm (3 to 4 ft) tall, depending on the precise model. Land mines were often laid between the individual "teeth", and further obstacles were constructed along the lines of "teeth", such as barbed wire to impede infantry or diagonally-placed steel beams to further hinder tanks.

They rested on a concrete mat between ten and thirty meters wide, sunk in a meter or two into the ground (to prevent any attempt to tunnel underneath them and place explosive
