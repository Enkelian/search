Time Is Money (Bastard)
"Time Is Money (Bastard)" is a song by American experimental rock band Swans. It was released as a 12-inch single in 1986, through record label K.422. Background Notable for the first official appearance of Jarboe, this single also marks a turning point in the band's sound, moving away from the slow, churning noise rock of their early work to a more minimal, industrial sound. Both mixes of the title song utilise sampled beats (in this case a nail gun) in addition to live drums. The down-tempo B-side "Sealed in Skin", however, pushes the band's sound even further as the first in their catalogue to use piano. Critical reception Trouser Press described "Time Is Money (Bastard)" as a "great single", and Ned Raggett of AllMusic called the song "an underground industrial/dance hit" and noted its aggressively explicit lyrics.
