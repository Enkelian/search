Founded in 1995 by John Hughes III, the label releases records in a range of genres that include post-rock, IDM, down-tempo, nu jazz, experimental music, and hip-hop. History Hefty Records was formed by John Hughes with Dan Snazelle as a way of releasing Hughes' own music. Hughes, the son of filmmaker John Hughes, had been interested in music since his youth, but had initially been more interested in record production than in creating music of his own.

Hughes chose the label name because, as he put it, "I liked it because it sounded optimistic. And it had a conquering tone to it."The first label's releases were of Hughes's own work as Slicker just after the breakup of his previous band Bill Ding. Hefty began the Immediate Action series in 2000, a collection intended to consist of six vinyl records. The sleeves were created by the Brooklyn graphics company Graphic Havoc. In 2005, the label hosted a live concert in Chicago and released two volumes of compilation
