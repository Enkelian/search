Vanadium(V) chloride
Vanadium(V) chloride is the inorganic compound with the formula VCl5. It is a black diamagnetic solid. The molecules adopt a bioctahedral structure similar to that of niobium(V) chloride. Preparation and reactions Vanadium(V) chloride is prepared from the vanadium pentafluoride with excess boron trichloride: 2 VF5 + 10 BCl3 → [VCl5]2 + 10 BF2ClIt is unstable at room temperature with respect to vanadium(IV) chloride: [VCl5]2 → 2 VCl4 + Cl2 == References ==
