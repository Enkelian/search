BBC Audio Drama Awards
The BBC Audio Drama Awards is an awards ceremony created by BBC Radio to recognise excellence in the radio industry, in particular in audio dramas. The first awards were presented in 2012 and the ceremony has been located at BBC Radio's home Radio Theatre, Broadcasting House.The awards were announced in October 2011 and first opened to nominations. The first ceremony proved hugely successful. Prior to this, there was no official awards ceremony to recognise audio dramas; the Sony Radio Academy Awards mainly encompassed radio shows and presenters while the Richard Imison Award (best drama by a newcomer) and Tinniswood Award (for best original drama) were awarded separately. The Imison and Tinniswood Awards are now incorporated into the Audio Drama Awards. Nominations and Judges Although nominations are dominated by the BBC's in-house arts-oriented stations, namely Radio 3 and Radio 4, entries are open to other radio stations. The judges included personalities in the radio, acting and theatre industry and literary world such as British dramatist Nell Leyshon, American novelist Stephen Wright, performance historian Viv Gardner, English actor Robert Bathurst, long-time BBC producer and Director-General (since April 2013) Lord Hall, comedian Alexei Sayle, actress Imogen Stubbs and Royal Shakespeare Company associate director
