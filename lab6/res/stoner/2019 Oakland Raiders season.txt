2019 Oakland Raiders season
The 2019 season was the Oakland Raiders' 60th since they were founded, their 50th in the National Football League and their second under head coach Jon Gruden since his rehiring by the organization (sixth overall).The Raiders finished the season 7–9, improving on the prior season 4–12 record, but failing to make the playoffs for the third straight year and the 16th time in the last 17 years. The Raiders were not eliminated from playoff contention until the final week of the season after losing to the Denver Broncos.After initially stating they would not return to RingCentral Coliseum for 2019, the Raiders were effectively forced to return to the stadium after their regional rivals, the San Francisco 49ers, blocked an effort to play at Oracle Park while they awaited the completion of Allegiant Stadium in Paradise, Nevada. Assuming Allegiant Stadium is in a usable state by 2020, this will have been the 25th and final season in the team's second tenure in Oakland and mark the end of the team's longest continuous tenure in one city. It was announced on June 11, 2019 that the Raiders would be featured on HBO's Hard Knocks, premiering on August 6, 2019.Prior to the season,
