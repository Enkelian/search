Arab diaspora
Arab diaspora refers to descendants of the Arab immigrants who, voluntarily or as refugees, emigrated from their native lands to non-Arab countries, primarily in Central America, South America, Europe, North America, and parts of South Asia, Southeast Asia, the Caribbean, and West Africa.
