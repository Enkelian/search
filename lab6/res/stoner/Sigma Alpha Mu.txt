Sigma Alpha Mu
Sigma Alpha Mu (ΣΑΜ), commonly known as Sammy, is a college fraternity founded at the City College of New York in 1909. Though initially founded as a Jewish organization, the fraternity dropped its religious affiliation and became open to men of all faiths in 1953. The fraternity was originally headquartered in New York City, where it was founded. Today its headquarters are located in Indianapolis, Indiana, along with many other fraternities. Since its inception, Sigma Alpha Mu has initiated more than 67,000 members at 150 active and inactive chapters and colonies across the United States and Canada. It is one of three major national/international social fraternities to have been founded at the City College of New York, the others being Delta Sigma Phi and Zeta Beta Tau.
