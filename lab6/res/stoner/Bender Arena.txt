Bender Arena is a 4,500-seat multi-purpose arena in Washington, D.C.. The arena opened in 1988. It is home to the American University Eagles basketball, volleyball and wrestling teams. The arena, named for Washington, D.C. philanthropists, Howard and Sondra Bender, is also the primary campus venue for concerts, commencement and speakers, seating up to 6,000. The arena's main court is named for the late former American University athletic director and coach Stafford H. "Pop" Cassell, another AU alum. Bender Arena's current main scoreboard, installed prior to the 2001â€“02 season, includes a 7-by-9-foot (2.1 by 2.7 m) animation and video display and advertising signage for corporate sponsors.

Bender Arena is the flagship facility of the American University Sports Center, which also includes a fitness center, wrestling room, the Reeves Aquatic Center, a mini-mall, the campus store, and a 470-car, seven-level parking garage. The 300,000-square-foot (28,000 m2) building is adjacent to the Mary Graydon Center, a design intended to increase campus interaction.
