Star Park
Star Park is the name applied to several former sports stadiums in Syracuse, New York. The name referred to the Syracuse professional baseball teams, which were called the Stars beginning around 1870 and continuing in most seasons until the last Stars team was fielded in 1929. The first of these venues was an alternate name of Newell Park, at the southeast corner of South Salina Street and what is now East Raynor Avenue. It was the home field of Stars teams from 1878 through 1884, including the Syracuse Stars of the National League in 1879.The second, and longest-lived, Star Park opened in 1885, a couple of long blocks north of Newell Park. It was bounded by Salina, Taylor, Oneida and Temple Streets, with the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad tracks running through a corner of the block. In addition to various Syracuse Stars minor league clubs through its two decades of existence, the field was the home of the Syracuse Stars of the major league American Association during the 1890 season. After 20 years of use, the city decided not to renew the ball club's lease, and ran what is now South Clinton Street through the propertyThe next Star Park
