Tears (Rush song)
"Tears" is a song by the Canadian progressive rock band Rush. It appears on their 1976 album 2112. It is the first Rush song to feature the Mellotron, which Hugh Syme plays. Background Geddy Lee said in an interview about the song: "'Tears' is a romantic ballad to give the album even more variety and depth. Mellotrons are very unique-sounding; they sound sorta electric, but also kinda stringy, they have this real resin-y sound to them, which is very cool and unique to that period." Reception Music Emissions said that it was the most underrated song on the album and that it was a departure for the band as a very heart-felt song of loss and regret.Bill Banasiewicz said in the book Rush Visions that "It's better produced than 'Lessons', which immediately precedes it. It is very much in the mode of 'Rivendell' and marks one of the few times that Neil plays in a straight four-time signature."Robert Telleria, in the book Merely Players, said about the song "once again Geddy proves heâ€™s not just a screamer and his lyrics improved." Alice in Chains version American rock band Alice in Chains covered the song and released it as a single.
