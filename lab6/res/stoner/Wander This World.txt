Wander This World
Wander This World is the third studio album by American blues guitarist Jonny Lang, released in 1998, when he was 17. The album was recorded at Seedy Underbelly Studios and Oarfin Studios in Minneapolis and the Sound Kitchen in Nashville. This album produced Lang's first Grammy nomination. The album contains a mix of genres; some tracks are blues, while others are Southern-style soul, funk, or rock with blues feeling. "Angel of Mercy" and Luther Allison's "Cherry Red Wine" are twelve-bar blues, "Walking Away" and "Second Guessing" are similar to 1960s Memphis soul, and "The Levee" and "Still Rainin'" are more rock orientated.Reviewer Alex Henderson commented on how mature the 17-year-old Lang sounded, saying the album often sounded like it could be the work of a 30-year-old.
