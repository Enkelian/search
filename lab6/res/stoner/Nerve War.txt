Nerve War
Nerve War is the first release by the Canadian band Front Line Assembly (known as Frontline Assembly at the time). Having a limited cassette release (between 50 and 100) in 1986, it remains the most sought-after release from Bill Leeb and company. The songs on the tape sound more abrasive and industrial than Leeb's more-recent output which leans more toward an EBM style. It has never been officially released after Front Line Assembly became more popular (supposedly the master tapes were lost), however, MP3s of it have appeared on the Internet since about 2002. There are three different versions of Nerve War, with varying track listings, lengths, and titles. The original release included a song entitled "Thy Glory", which was removed from subsequent releases at the insistence of cEvin Key of Skinny Puppy, due to the usage of a bass line from his Tear Garden song. "The Steal" and "Cold As Ice" were also removed for reasons unknown, replaced with two untitled tracks. On a third version of Nerve War, "Thy Glory" reappears, along with new tracks "View To Kill", "To The World", "Holy War I" and "Holy War II".
