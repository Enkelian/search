Diana Ross (1970 album)
Diana Ross (later reissued rarely as Ain't No Mountain High Enough) is the debut solo studio album by American singer Diana Ross. It reached number 19 on the Billboard 200 and number one on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums. The album would later go onto sell 500,000 copies in America.The album was the ultimate test to see if the former Supremes frontwoman could make it as a solo act. Overseen by the songwriting-producing team of Nickolas Ashford & Valerie Simpson, the album includes several cover versions of songs the duo had recorded on other Motown acts. Johnny Bristol, producer of her final single with The Supremes, "Someday We'll Be Together" also contributed one track "These Things Will Keep Me Loving You" (which was a UK hit when originally recorded by The Velvelettes). Ross' first solo single, "Reach Out and Touch (Somebody's Hand)", sold over 500,000 copies in the USA, but was somewhat of a disappointment in terms of chart success, when it charted at number 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. Its follow-up, a cover of Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell's "Ain't No Mountain High Enough", peaked at number one on the Hot 100, selling approximately 1,245,000 copies in the USA,
