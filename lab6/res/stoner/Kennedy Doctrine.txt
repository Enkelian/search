Kennedy Doctrine
The Kennedy Doctrine refers to foreign policy initiatives of the 35th President of the United States, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, towards Latin America during his administration between 1961 and 1963. Kennedy voiced support for the containment of communism as well as the reversal of communist progress in the Western Hemisphere. Inaugural address: "Pay any price, bear any burden" In his Inaugural Address on January 20, 1961, President Kennedy presented the American public with a blueprint upon which the future foreign policy initiatives of his administration would later follow and come to represent. In this Address, Kennedy warned "Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty."1 He also called upon the public to assist in "a struggle against the common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself."1 It is in this address that one begins to see the Cold War, us-versus-them mentality that came to dominate the Kennedy administration. Cold War containment A dominant premise during the Kennedy years was the need to contain communism at any cost.
