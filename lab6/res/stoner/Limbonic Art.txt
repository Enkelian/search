Limbonic Art is a Norwegian symphonic black metal band from Sandefjord. History Limbonic Art was formed in 1993 by Daemon, and was originally a full band featuring 3 other members. Daemon got in touch with Morfeus after the demise of the first line-up. The first recording, a rehearsal demo, was released independently in 1995. The debut album Moon in the Scorpio was released in 1996. The follow-up, 1997's In Abhorrence Dementia, was supported by a tour opening for Emperor, and a year later Limbonic Art issued its third LP, Epitome of Illusions. In 2003, the band decided to split up with a statement from the official site saying "We feel that we have reached as far as we could in our collaboration ... the circle is complete, begin another". On June 6, 2006, Limbonic Art reunited and started to write new material. On February 21, 2007 it was announced that the band plans to release the new album entitled Legacy of Evil in the summer.A subsequent dispute between the band members resulted in Morfeus being ousted from the band, making Limbonic Art essentially Daemon's solo project. He has currently completed the new Limbonic Art release, named Phantasmagoria, out summer 2010.
