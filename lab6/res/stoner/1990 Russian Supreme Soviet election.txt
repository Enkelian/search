A total of 1,068 deputies were elected to the Congress of People's Deputies of the RSFSR for a term of five years, 86% of them from the Communist Party, the rest were non-partisan. Parties other than the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) were not formally allowed to participate in the election, however the elections were competitive and the Democratic Russia movement, an organization uniting many opposition political groups, won about 190 seats. The elected Congress began its first session on 16 May.

It was the first and only free election to the Congress of People's Deputies of the RSFSR. It became the Congress of People's Deputies of the Russian Federation after the dissolution
