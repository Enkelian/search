Mount Anville Secondary School
Mount Anville Secondary School is a Roman Catholic, voluntary all-girls post-primary school in Goatstown, a suburb of Dublin, in Ireland. It was originally an all-boarding school, but in recent years due to decreased demand for such schools it has become a day-school. It has approximately 659 students, and is attached to Mount Anville Montessori Junior School and Mount Anville Convent. It was established in 1853 by nuns of the Society of the Sacred Heart in the former home of William Dargan, an influential railway tycoon. Mount Anville was once situated in north Dublin.
