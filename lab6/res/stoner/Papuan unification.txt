Papuan unification
The unification (or re-unification) of Papua New Guinea (or East Papua), an independent state, and West Papua (or Western New Guinea), a territory of Indonesia, both parts of the New Guinea island, has been raised since the second half of the 20th century.Generally, proposals regarding federation with Papua New Guinea are a minority view in the Free Papua Movement. Arguments for federation generally focus around shared cultural identity between the two halves of the island. History The gradual unification of the two halves of the island was official Australian government policy for a short period of time in the 1960’s, before Indonesia’s annexation of West Papua.
