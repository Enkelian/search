Brexit Party
The Brexit Party is a Eurosceptic political party in the United Kingdom. It became an active party in January 2019, and is currently led by Nigel Farage. It has four Welsh Assembly Members. Prior to Brexit the party had 23 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs). Their largest electoral success was winning the largest share of the national vote in the 2019 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom (29 seats), four months after its foundation. The party's priority has been for Britain to withdraw from the European Union (EU) and to move to World Trade Organisation trading rules if a free trade agreement cannot be agreed, which it describes as "a clean-break Brexit", more commonly known as a "no-deal Brexit". Generally described as populist, it draws its support from those who are frustrated with the delayed implementation of the 2016 referendum decision and wish to leave the EU without remaining part of the EU's Single Market or Customs Union. Many of its supporters were formerly of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) – Farage having led UKIP from 2006 to 2009 and from 2010 to 2016 – as well as from the Conservative Party, including high-profile defectors such as Ann
