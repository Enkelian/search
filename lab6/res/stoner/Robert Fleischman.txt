He is known for working with the rock group Journey, briefly as their lead vocalist in 1977 and occasionally thereafter a songwriting collaborator. Biography Fleischman, originally the frontman of LA band Staggerwing is perhaps best known as the lead singer for the rock band Journey from June until November 1977, between the group's albums, Next and Infinity. He appeared in live concert performances with Journey and co-wrote and recorded numerous studio demo tracks during the band's early writing sessions for the upcoming album, Infinity. Three of those co-written tracks appear on the album: "Anytime", "Wheel in the Sky" (reaching #57 on the Billboard charts), and "Winds of March". The only officially released Journey song featuring Fleischman's vocals is "For You" which can be found on Journey's box-set release, Time3, as well as on Fleischman's 1979 solo album entitled Perfect Stranger. He may have also contributed to the track "Velvet Curtain" (also found on Time3) which was later re-written as "Feeling That Way" and credited to Aynsley Dunbar, Steve Perry, and Gregg Rolie.
