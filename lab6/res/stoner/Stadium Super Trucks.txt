Stadium Super Trucks
The Stadium Super Trucks (SST), officially the Speed Energy Stadium Super Trucks and formerly known as Speed Energy Formula Off-Road, is an American and Australian off-road racing series created by off-road racer and former IndyCar and NASCAR driver Robby Gordon in 2013. Sanctioned by the United States Auto Club (USAC) in America with title sponsorship from Gordon's Speed Energy brand, the series utilizes identical off-road trucks that originally competed primarily in American football stadiums, but in 2014 began racing mostly on street circuits and road courses, often in conjunction with the IndyCar Series race schedules. In Australia, SST operates the Boost Mobile Super Trucks championship. Sanctioned by Motorsport Australia and promoted by Boost Mobile, the series was founded in 2020 and supports the Supercars Championship. Matthew Brabham is the current series champion after winning the title in 2019. Two-time champion Sheldon Creed has the most wins in series history with 36. History By 2011, there was speculation that after his NASCAR career was over, Robby Gordon would bring back the concept of stadium off-road racing that Mickey Thompson had invented. Gordon announced the formation of the Stadium Super Trucks (SST) in 2012, modeling the series after Thompson's MTEG stadium series;
