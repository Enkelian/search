The Rise of Brutality
The Rise of Brutality is the third studio album by American metalcore band Hatebreed. It was released on October 28, 2003 by Universal Records. Background "This is Now" proved to be the album's first single, frequently being played on MTV2's Headbangers Ball, a program which vocalist Jamey Jasta often hosted. The song was also included on the first MTV2 Headbangers Ball compilation album that same year. A second single would be found in "Live for This," with its music video dedicated to a deceased friend of the band. The song "Another Day, Another Vendetta," greatly samples the song "Just Look Around," by Sick of it All, borrowing the first verse. The first song, "Tear It Down" is an extended version of the song "Outro" from the previous album Perseverance. Their song "Live for This" was nominated for a Grammy award in 2005. The bonus track "Bound to Violence" appeared on The Punisher (2004 film) soundtrack. Track listing All tracks are written by Hatebreed.
