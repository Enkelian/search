Stamping Ground (album)
Stamping Ground is a live album by Bill Bruford's Earthworks, released on EG Records in 1994. Reception The Allmusic review by Bill Meredith awards this album with 4.5 stars and states: "Bruford's chordal patterns sound practically symphonic amid his epic starts and stops — further proof of the originality of one of the most musical drummers of all-time. Like all great live releases, Stamping Ground makes you wish you had been there."
