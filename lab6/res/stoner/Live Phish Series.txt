Live Phish Series
LivePhish (also Live Phish) is an ongoing series of complete Phish concert recordings. The original twenty-volume series was released by Elektra Records and launched while Phish was on hiatus from recording and touring (October 2000 to December 2002). Numbered 01 through 20, each multi-disc set was made available individually and featured innovative packaging: a cardboard slipcase containing the compact discs housed in a foldable plastic page that could be stored in a ShowCase binder that was sold separately or with select copies of Volume 06. The first six volumes were simultaneously released on September 18, 2001. The rest of the series was then released in sporadic batches throughout May 2003. Among the initial twenty volumes, there are four two-disc sets, twelve three-disc sets and four quadruple-disc sets totaling over forty-seven and a half hours of live recordings ranging from 1989 to 2000. The original plastic fold-out CD pages eventually began leaking a strange chemically reactive liquid goo that often ruined the CDs within the original foil CD covers. Elektra Records thus began re-issuing several LIVE PHISH Volumes 1 through 20 in clamshell CD cases in the mid-2000s. In late 2002, to coincide with Phish's return to the stage, "LivePhish Downloads"
