Adkins, Texas
Adkins is an Unincorporated community in eastern Bexar County, Texas, United States. It lies on FM 1518, about one mile north of the Texas Pride Restaurant. History The town of Adkins was named for William Adkins Jones who donated land for a flag station on the Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railway in the late 1800s. He owned a general store and was the first Adkins postmaster when a post office was established there in 1896. In the early 1900s the town had a population of about a hundred, two churches, and a school. After the rail line was abandoned and the major highways by-passed the town, the population steadily declined. In 1915 the post office was moved to nearby Sayers, however the post office and postal area are still called Adkins, even though almost nothing of the original town now remains. The town is still recognized today as an actual city, as is located in part of Bexar County, TX and in Wilson County, TX. Adkins is home to Texas Pride BBQ, which was featured on the Food Network show Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. Adkins is also home to Cactus Land Brewing Company, which is a small artisan craft
