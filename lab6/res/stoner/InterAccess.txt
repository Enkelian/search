InterAccess
InterAccess is a Canadian artist-run centre and electronic media production facility in Toronto. Founded in 1982 as Toronto Community Videotex, InterAccess is Ontario's only exhibition space devoted exclusively to technological media arts. The Centre for Contemporary Canadian Art places the founding of InterAccess as a key moment in both the history of Canadian electronic art but also within a timeline of developments in international art, science, technology and culture. History In 1983, InterAccess was incorporated as a not-for-profit, artist-run access centre, under the name Toronto Community Videotex (TCV). It provided artists access to the Telidon system, a precursor of the World Wide Web. The early conception of electronic art placed the organization within the production cooperative system in Canada. TCV's members created artworks which fell within the more systems-based notions of art production, rather than the beaux-arts aesthetic of the museum. The name change to InterAccess in 1987 reflected a new focus on Macintosh graphics, multimedia production and a dial-up artistsâ€™ network (much like a Bulletin Board System, or BBS) known as Matrix.InterAccess moved to a larger facility in 1995 allowing InterAccess to offer a gallery and production space that expanded its activities beyond simply access to multimedia production.
