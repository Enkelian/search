Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) is a rapid transit public transportation system serving the San Francisco Bay Area in California. The heavy rail elevated and subway system connects San Francisco and Oakland with urban and suburban areas in Alameda, Contra Costa, and San Mateo counties. BART serves 48 stations along six routes on 112 miles (180 km) of rapid transit lines, including a 10-mile (16 km) spur line in eastern Contra Costa County which utilizes diesel multiple-unit trains and a 3.2-mile (5.1 km) automated guideway transit line to the Oakland International Airport. With an average of 411,000 weekday passengers and 118 million annual passengers in fiscal year 2019, BART is the fifth-busiest heavy rail rapid transit system in the United States. BART is operated by the Bay Area Rapid Transit District, formed in 1957. The initial system opened in stages from 1972 to 1974. The Silicon Valley BART Extension is scheduled to open in Milpitas and Berryessa (San Jose) in 2020, in partnership with the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA).
