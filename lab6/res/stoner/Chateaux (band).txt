Chateaux (band)
Chateaux were a new wave of British heavy metal band formed in 1981 in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, United Kingdom. They released three albums during the 1980s through Ebony Records, then home to the likes of Grim Reaper and Savage. The band is notable for launching the career of Steve Grimmett, later of Grim Reaper and Onslaught. Biography The band were originally formed under the name of Stealer circa 1981 by guitarist Tim Broughton, bassist Alex Houston and drummer Andre Baylis. They were selected by the newly started Ebony Records for inclusion on their 1982 Metal Maniaxe compilation, changing their name to Chateaux and contributing the track "Young Blood"; at the time, bassist Alex Houston was providing vocals, and the song was later released as a single by Ebony, backed with "Fight to the Last". 1983 saw the release of the band's debut album, Chained and Desperate, again on Ebony Records, produced by Daryl Johnson, and featuring vocals by ex-Medusa and then-Grim Reaper man Steve Grimmett. For reasons unknown, the band insisted that Grimmett's appearance was simply that of a guest, allowing him to remain focussed on Grim Reaper.
