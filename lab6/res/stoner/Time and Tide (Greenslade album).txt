Time and Tide (Greenslade album)
Time and Tide is the fourth studio album of the British progressive rock band Greenslade, released in 1975 on Warner Bros. Records. The artwork for the album cover is by Patrick Woodroffe. The album was released in the US on the Mercury Records label. An edited version of "Catalan" was released as a single, with "Animal Farm" as the B-side, but both it and the album itself failed to chart. The track "Gangsters" was used as the theme music for the BBC TV series of the same name. Having written the theme in 1974 for a one-off programme “Gangsters”, in 1976 Dave Greenslade wrote lyrics for the tune. This version was recorded by Chris Farlowe and was used for the last series in 1978. The track was included, as a bonus track, on the CD re-issue of Dave Greenslade's solo Cactus Choir album. Cover art Andrew McCulloch, who was at the time reading a science fiction novel with cover art by Patrick Woodroffe, suggested that he be brought on to do the art for Time and Tide. Background and recording Time and Tide saw the revival of the Dave Greenslade-Dave Lawson songwriting partnership which had been dormant during Spyglass Guest.
