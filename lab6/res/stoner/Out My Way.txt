Out My Way
Out My Way is a mini-album released by the alternative rock band the Meat Puppets in 1986. It features a more hard rock oriented sound than the band usually has, leading some critics to say that the sound is similar to southern/hard rock stylings of ZZ Top. The EP was reissued in 1999 by Rykodisc with additional bonus tracks. The cover art is by Curt Kirkwood. Track listing All songs written by Curt Kirkwood, unless otherwise noted.
