High on the Hog (Black Oak Arkansas album)
High on the Hog is the most commercially successful album by the southern rock band Black Oak Arkansas. It is mainly known for its cover of the LaVern Baker song "Jim Dandy", which reached number 25 on the Billboard Hot 100. The album prominently featured southern electric guitar licks and James Mangrum's scratchy, hillbilly vocals. Critical reception On AllMusic, Donald A. Guarisco wrote "["Jim Dandy"] is definitely High on the Hog's undisputed highlight, but the other tracks surrounding it also have plenty to offer. Although they were too eccentric a band to fit a strict "Southern rock" label Ã  la Lynyrd Skynyrd, Black Oak Arkansas did have an ability to dish up both country and rock sounds with style.... [T]he group also shows a surprising ability to mix elements of pure funk into their country-rock stew..."
