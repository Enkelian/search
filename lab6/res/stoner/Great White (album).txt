Great White (album)
Great White is the first full-length album by the American rock band Great White. Three tracks are taken from the band's previous EP, albeit in re-recorded versions. The musical style of this album is very different from the following highly successful releases of Great White, as they display here a more hard-driving metal sound as opposed to their later, blues-infused rock sound. EMI America judged the album a disaster and Great White were dropped. This led to a rethink by the band, and they became less heavy, introducing a tame hard rock sound for later albums.The CD reissue of 1999, done under the name Stick It by the French label Axe Killer, features five bonus tracks.
