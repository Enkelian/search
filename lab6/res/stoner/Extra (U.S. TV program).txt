Extra (U.S. TV program)
Extra (originally titled Extra: The Entertainment Magazine from 1994 to 1996) is an American syndicated television newsmagazine that is distributed by Warner Bros. Television Distribution and premiered on September 5, 1994. The program serves as a straight rundown of news headlines and gossip throughout the entertainment industry, providing coverage of events and celebrities; however, since 2013, it has also placed an even greater emphasis on interviews and insider previews of upcoming film and television projects. As of 2019, the program's weekday broadcasts are anchored by Billy Bush, with the weekend editions anchored by Renee Bargh and Jennifer Lahmers. History The series was developed in the fall of 1993, for a planned launch during the 1994â€“95 television season. The program was developed under the working title Entertainment News Television; however due to claims that it too closely mirrored its own name, cable channel E!: Entertainment Television filed a lawsuit against Warner Bros. Television and Telepictures Productions to bar them from using the title; although E! lost the lawsuit in a summary judgment hearing allowing Warner Bros. to continue to use the ENT title for the series, Warner Bros. decided to change the name of the program to Extra: The Entertainment Magazine
