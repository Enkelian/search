Hatefiles
Hatefiles is a Fear Factory compilation album of rare, unreleased and remixed tracks released by Roadrunner Records on April 8, 2003. The album is notable as it contains "Terminate" the last song to be recorded with original guitarist Dino Cazares until his return to the band in 2009. Graphic designer Dave McKean's artwork is also used. Tracks 2, 3, 4, 5 and 13 all appeared on the Australian-only release of the Linchpin E.P. Track 5 also appeared on the soundtrack for the film Resident Evil, whilst track 13 also appeared on Ozzfest: Second Stage Live. 14, 15 and 16 appeared on the Burn single from Remanufacture. Track 17 was available on the 7" vinyl-only The Gabber Mixes EP. Tracks 9 and 10 are early versions of the tracks which would later appear on Demanufacture as mixed by Colin Richardson, the album's producer. The final album mix is credited to Greg Reely. Track 11 is the same as the version that appeared on the limited edition of Obsolete, but mostly features only Gary Numan on vocals. Tracks 7 and 8 appeared on the Cars single. Track 12 is an early demo of the song (Invisible Wounds) Dark Bodies from Digimortal. Tracks
