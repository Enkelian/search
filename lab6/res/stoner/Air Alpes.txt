Air Alpes
Société Air Alpes was a French airline company headquartered in Chambéry Airport and in Viviers-du-Lac, Savoie, near Chambéry. Established in 1961 by Michel Ziegler, the airline's history began in the French Alps. History Air Alpes was founded in 1961 by Michel Ziegler, with its registered office at Chambéry Airport. He received backing from Henri Ziegler and Sylvain Floirat, who became the two first shareholders; followed later on by Joseph Szydlowski, the founder of aircraft engine manufacturer Turbomeca. Due to the construction of new facilities at Chambéry Airport, the registered office was transferred to Courchevel Airport. Operations were initially with a Piper PA-18 Super Cub, mainly offering flying lessons and carrying supplies into the mountains. A PC-6/340 Porter was leased, but on September 2, 1961, it was destroyed during a training flight at the "Col du Dome" in the Mont Blanc mountains. In 1962, a replacement turboprop Pilatus PC-6/A-H2 Porter was acquired. Glacier skiing drop-offs were very important during the first years of Air Alpes' operation. The company built its own airstrips, called altiports at various high-altitude locations. Landings could only be achieved with guidance from the ground. A very close cooperation was established between the company and ski-instructors and guides
