Circle C Ranch
Circle C Ranch (also known as Circle C) is a large master-planned community in southwest Austin, Texas, USA. Development of Circle C Ranch began in 1982, with the first homes in the community in built in 1986. During development, the subdivision was featured prominently in a long and contentious environmental legal battle regarding urban development in the vicinity of Barton Springs and over Edwards Aquifer. The controversy surrounding its development and later annexation by the city of Austin was a landmark in municipal annexation rights in Texas. Today, Circle C Ranch includes more than 6,400 homes. Amenities include an 18-hole golf course called the Grey Rock Golf Club, tennis club, four swim centers, a fire station, and more than 500 acres (2.0 km2) of dedicated parkland. The Circle C Swim Center has a year-round, outdoor, Olympic-size heated pool. A second, family oriented swimming pool complex, with office space and meeting rooms, was finished at the end of January 2012. The third pool in the Avana section of Circle C was built in 2014 and opened in 2015. The fourth pool located in the GreyRock section of Circle C opened in 2017.
