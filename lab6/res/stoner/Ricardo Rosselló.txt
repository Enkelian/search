Ricardo Rosselló
Ricardo "Ricky" Antonio Rosselló Nevares (American Spanish: [roˈseʝo]; born March 7, 1979) is a Puerto Rican politician, scientist, and businessman. From 2017 to 2019, Rosselló served as governor of Puerto Rico. He resigned on August 2, 2019 after protests related to the Telegramgate scandal. He is the son of former governor of Puerto Rico and pediatric surgeon Pedro Rosselló. In 2010, Rosselló founded the political advocacy group Boricua ¡Ahora Es! to advocate for changing the current political status of Puerto Rico. Rosselló supports Puerto Rican statehood. Following several years of political advocacy, Rosselló announced that he would seek the nomination of the New Progressive Party (PNP in Spanish) for Governor of Puerto Rico in 2016. After winning the New Progressive Party primary, Rosselló was elected Governor in the 2016 general election, defeating five other candidates. In July 2019, Rosselló faced widespread controversy after a group chat on the Telegram app between Rosselló and his staff was made public. The chat included vulgar misogynistic and homophobic language, a discussion of the operation of Internet troll networks on social media, jokes about people who had died during hurricane Maria, and an apparent death threat made by Rosselló against Mayor of San Juan
