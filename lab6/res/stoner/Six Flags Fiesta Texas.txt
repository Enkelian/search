Six Flags Fiesta Texas
Six Flags Fiesta Texas, formerly Fiesta Texas, is a theme park located in La Cantera, San Antonio, Texas. It is owned and operated by Six Flags. The park was built by Gaylord Entertainment Company and opened on March 14, 1992 as the first business in the district of San Antonio. The park was later purchased by Time Warner in 1996, who turned it into a Six Flags park. Spanning 200 acres (81 ha), the park was originally built to become a destination performance arts park with its focus on the musical culture of the state of Texas.The park's current icon is Scream which can be seen from all around the park as well as outside the property. The vibrant colors of Scream can also be seen from the intersection of Loop 1604 and Interstate 10, as well as miles away from Six Flags Fiesta Texas. Most of the other attractions at the park are hidden due to the park being surrounded by a rock quarry wall, but some key visible rides include the SkyScreamer, the Crow's Nest Ferris wheel in Fiesta Bay Boardwalk, the lift hill of Superman: Krypton Coaster and the lift hill of Iron Rattler.
