Sulfur tetrachloride
Sulfur tetrachloride is an inorganic compound with chemical formula SCl4. It has only been obtained as an unstable pale yellow solid. The corresponding SF4 is a stable, useful reagent. Preparation and structure It is obtained by treating sulfur dichloride with chlorine at 193 K: It melts with simultaneous decomposition above −20 °C.Its solid structure is uncertain. It is probably the salt SCl3+Cl−, since related salts are known with noncoordinating anions. In contrast to this tetrachloride, SF4 is a neutral molecule. Reactions It decomposes above −30 °C (242 K) to sulfur dichloride and chlorine. It hydrolyzes readily: Sulfur tetrachloride reacts with water, producing hydrogen chloride and sulfur dioxide through the hydrolysis process. Thionyl chloride is an implied intermediate.
