The Peter and Clotilde Shipe Mansbendel House is an historic home in the Hyde Park Historic District in Austin, Texas, United States.

The house was built in 1925 by Peter Mansbendel, a master carpenter who personally added carved-wood decorations to the home. Mansbendel also carved wooden doors for the mid-century restoration of the Governor's Palace in San Antonio, and provided work for Austin's first permanent public library in 1933. The house is located at 3824 Avenue F. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. == References ==
