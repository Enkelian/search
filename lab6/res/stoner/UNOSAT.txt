UNOSAT
UNOSAT was established in 2001 as an operational, technology-intensive programme of the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR). UNOSAT provides satellite imagery analysis and capacity development to the UN system, UN member states, and its partners. The programme's work supports evidence-based decision making for peace, security and resilience. UNOSAT products are used in response to humanitarian crises and for implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The UNOSAT team is mainly composed of GIS and imagery analysts, remote sensing experts, geologists, hydrogeologists and hydrologists, supported by IT engineers, programmers, and management experts. UNOSAT is headquartered at The European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland with regional presence in Bangkok, Nairobi and Nâ€™Djamena.
