It's Your Love
"It's Your Love" is a song written by Stephony Smith, and performed by American country music artist Tim McGraw. It was released in May 1997 as the first single from his album Everywhere. The song, featuring wife Faith Hill, reached number one on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart in its fifth week on the chart. The song stayed there for six weeks (the first time a song spent that many weeks there since "Luckenbach, Texas (Back to the Basics of Love)" in 1977), and became McGraw's and Hill's first top-ten hit on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number seven. The accompanying music video, directed and produced by Sherman Halsey is notable in that it showcases Hill, who was very noticeably pregnant with the couple's first daughter, Gracie. The music video won Video of the Year at the 1997 Academy of Country Music Awards. The song was later recorded by pop trio She Moves, whose version peaked at number 67 on the Hot 100. The song appears on the game Karaoke Revolution Country. Track listing Promo CD It's Your Love (Hot A/C Mix)Single It's Your Love 3:40 She Never Lets It Go To Her Heart 3:02 Awards Academy of Country
