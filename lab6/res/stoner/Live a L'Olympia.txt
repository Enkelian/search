Live a L'Olympia
Live Ã€ L'Olympia is a live album by Jeff Buckley, released in 2001 (see 2001 in music). It is the second posthumous live album released since his death in 1997. The CD consists of performances taken from two separate concerts Buckley and his band played on July 6/7 1995 at Paris Olympia. The French crowd were very receptive as he was well regarded there, as shown when he was awarded France's prestigious "Grand Prix International Du Disque" earlier that year. Buckley paused midway in some of the songs to address the crowd and "Hallelujah" features ad-libbed lyrics in response to their enthusiasm. The album also features a version of a song from Nina Simone's repertoire, "That's All I Ask". It is one of two versions of the song officially released, the other appearing on a three-track bonus disc issued with Australian copies of Buckley's Mystery White Boy live album. Buckley played the song at various concerts on his 1995 European tour. In addition to the Olympia concert material, the CD features a unique recorded version of "What Will You Say", performed as a duet with Azerbaijani Mugham singer Alim Qasimov. This recording is from the 1995 "Festival of Sacred Music"
