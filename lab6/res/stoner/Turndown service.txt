Turndown service
In the hospitality industry, turndown service refers to the practice of staff entering a guest's room and "turning down" the bed linen of the bed in the room, preparing the bed for use. In multiple countries, an item of confectionery such as a chocolate or a mint is sometimes left on top of a pillow on the bed that has been turned down. Some hotels have more elaborate turndown services, such as bed-time stories for children and cocktails served to couples. == References ==
