After more than 100,000 votes, Slipknot’s Joey Jordison was crowned as the winner, having taken more than 38,000 of the votes. In response to the award, Jordison told Rhythm: “This is bigger than a Grammy to me! You people keep me alive, I can't thank all of you enough. To all the Rhythm staff, thank you, you are amazing! Thank you to my family, friends, all the amazing drummers I was in company with, without them I wouldn't be here either
