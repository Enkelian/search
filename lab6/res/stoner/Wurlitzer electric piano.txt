Wurlitzer electric piano
The Wurlitzer electronic piano, commonly called the Wurli, is an electric piano manufactured and marketed by Wurlitzer from the mid-1950s to the early 1980s. The sound is generated by striking a metal reed with a hammer, which induces an electric current in a pickup; although conceptually similar to the Rhodes piano, the sound is different. Wurlitzer manufactured several different models of electric pianos, including console models with built-in frames, and standalone stage models with chrome legs. The latter became popular with several R&B and rock musicians in the 1960s and 70s, particularly Supertramp. Sound The official name of the instrument is the Wurlitzer Electronic Piano. However, the sound is generated electromechanically by striking a metal reed with a felt hammer, using conventional piano action. This induces an electrical current in an electrostatic pickup system using a DC voltage of 170v.Most Wurlitzer pianos are a 64-note instruments whose keyboard range is from A an octave above the lowest note of a standard 88-note piano to the C an octave below its top note. The sound is produced and the instrument is fitted with a mechanical sustain pedal.Compared with the equally-popular (Fender) Rhodes electric piano, the sound from a Wurlitzer is sharper
