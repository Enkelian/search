River Cherwell
The River Cherwell is a major tributary of the River Thames in central England. It rises near Hellidon in Northamptonshire and flows south through Oxfordshire for 40 miles (64 km) to meet the Thames at Oxford. It adds a significant discharge to the Thamesâ€”when entering Oxford, the Thames's discharge is 17.6 m3/s (620 cu ft/s), but after leaving and consuming the Cherwell it has increased to 24.8 m3/s (880 cu ft/s). The river gives its name to the Cherwell local government district and Cherwell, an Oxford student newspaper. Pronunciation Cherwell is pronounced (listen), particularly near Oxford, and in north Oxfordshire. The village of Charwelton takes its name from the river, but lies on the river's upper course in Northamptonshire, suggesting that the pronunciation was historically used more widely. Watershed and upper course The Cherwell is the northernmost tributary of the Thames. It rises in the ironstone hills at Hellidon, 2 miles (3.2 km) west of Charwelton near Daventry. Helidon Hill immediately north of the source forms a watershed: on the south side, the Cherwell feeds the River Thames and thence the North Sea at the Thames Estuary; on the north side, the River Leam feeds the Warwickshire River Avon and
