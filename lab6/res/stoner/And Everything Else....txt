Adam Park of Stylus Magazine gave the album a grade of B+, saying: "With each track an alluring fusion of styles and influences that never somehow puts a foot wrong, Nobody has taken the concept of faceless producer to its appellation rendered conclusion and in doing so produced a record that positively teems with gleeful personality." Max Herman of XLR8R described it as "an electronic-induced trip, driven by an abnormal palette of sampled sounds and hip-hop-ready drum patterns."
