The Barry Gibb Talk Show
The Barry Gibb Talk Show is a recurring sketch on Saturday Night Live about a talk show starring Bee Gees lead singer Barry Gibb (played by Jimmy Fallon) and his brother, Robin Gibb (Justin Timberlake). The sketch was created by writers Ken Scarborough and Steve Higgins based on an idea from Fallon.The sketch is characterized by Barry Gibb's accent as well as his falsetto voice, which he breaks into randomly while speaking, and his extremely short temper with his guests, usually political figures. Meanwhile, Robin provides lackluster answers to Barry's questions (usually "No. No, I don't.") as well as humorous backup for their call and response falsetto singing, particularly in the opening and closing credits. The sketch uses the music of the Bee Gees' 1975 hit "Nights on Broadway" (with parody lyrics) as its theme. The real Barry and Robin Gibb joined Fallon and Timberlake to perform on the March 16, 2010, episode of Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. Robin died in 2012. On December 21, 2013, Barry Gibb and Madonna appeared in the sixth, and as of 2020, final episode of the sketch. Episodes October 11, 2003 Justin Timberlake hosted and performed as the musical guest on the premiere
