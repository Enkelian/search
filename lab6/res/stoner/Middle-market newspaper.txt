Middle-market newspaper
A middle-market newspaper is a newspaper that attempts to cater to readers who like entertainment as well as the coverage of important news events. Middle-market status is the halfway point of a three-level continuum of journalistic seriousness; upper-market or "quality" newspapers generally cover hard news and down-market newspapers favour sensationalist stories. In the United Kingdom, since the demise of Today (1986â€“1995), the only national middle-market papers are the Daily Mail and the Daily Express, distinguishable by their black-top masthead (both use the easy-to-carry tabloid paper size), as opposed to the red-top mastheads of down-market tabloids. == References ==
