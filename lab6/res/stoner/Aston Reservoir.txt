Aston Reservoir
Aston Reservoir, sometimes known as Salford Lake, Salford Park Pool or Salford Bridge Reservoir, is a 19th-century reservoir, formerly used for drinking water extracted from the River Tame, in Birmingham, England. It was built by the Birmingham Waterworks Company and was at that time situated in the parish of Aston. On 1 January 1876 the company was purchased by Birmingham Corporation Water Department. More recently, it has been a boating lake, although this is no longer the case. In the 1950s it was used for speedboat racing. The area around the reservoir is used as a park, Salford Park. It sits immediately adjacent to Gravelly Hill Interchange, and in a bend of the river. References External links Midland Hydroplane Meeting, 1952 (Path√© newsreel)
