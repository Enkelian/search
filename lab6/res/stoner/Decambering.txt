Decambering
Decambering is the metalworking process of removing camber, or horizontal bend, from strip shaped materials. The material may be finite length sections or continuous coils. Decambering resembles flattening or levelling processes, but deforms the material edge (left or right) instead of the face (up or down) of the strip. Processes Decambering may be accomplished by a choice of several processes: The material may be "stretchformed" or stretched typically 1-2% elongation past its elastic limit, such that the camber is strained out, and the strip relaxes straight. Typically this is accomplished by routing the strip through two sets of 180 degree or more wrap driven "bridle rolls" with the second rolls rotating faster than the first. Cut strip can be gripped each end then stretched on a static rig with one end being mechanically pulled. The "stretchforming" process is most suited to thin strip. Wider material can be flat rolled with the rolls tilting such that the "short" edge is lengthened, with thickness slightly reduced, to equal the "long" edge. The material is then straight if properly processed. Several different types of these machines are available, ranging from position controlled to pressure controlled machines. Also, machines are available with automatic self
