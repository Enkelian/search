The Prairie Wife
The Prairie Wife is a 1925 American Western film directed by Hugo Ballin and featuring Boris Karloff, and based on a story by Arthur Stringer. The film is considered to be lost. It received a lukewarm review in Film Daily, as having some "humorous touches scattered through" but overlong. Variety wrote that "for a cheap picture, it should more than get the production cost back and show a corking profit."
