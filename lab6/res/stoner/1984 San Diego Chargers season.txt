1984 San Diego Chargers season
The 1984 San Diego Chargers season was the franchise's 15th season in the National Football League (NFL), its 25th overall. The Team improved on their 6â€“10 record in 1983 to 7-9. Despite winning seven games, the Chargers failed to win a single game within their division. Before the second game of the season against the Seattle Seahawks, running back Chuck Muncie missed the team's charter flight from San Diego. He told Chargers coach Don Coryell that he was late because vandals slashed the four tires on his car, but Coryell did not believe him. Muncie arrived in Seattle, but he was sent back to San Diego and did not play. Two days later, he was traded to the Miami Dolphins for a second-round draft pick; however, a urinalysis given by Miami detected cocaine, and the trade was voided. Afterwards, Muncie entered an Arizona drug rehabilitation center for a month. On November 15, he was suspended indefinitely by the NFL; he never played another NFL game.
