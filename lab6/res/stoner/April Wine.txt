April Wine
April Wine is a Canadian rock band formed in 1969 and based in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The band enjoyed international success in the 1970s and 1980s, releasing more than 20 albums since 1971. History Early years Although April Wine officially began in late 1969 in Waverley, Nova Scotia, their roots can be traced back to St. John's Newfoundland in 1967/68. David and Ritchie Henman moved there when their father took a job at a local furrier company, Mitchell Furs. They would be heard jamming in a house on the corner of Bonaventure Avenue and Fleming Street in St. John's before relocating to Nova Scotia. The original members were brothers David Henman on guitar and Ritchie Henman on drums. Their cousin Jim Henman joined in on bass and Myles Goodwyn completed the sound on lead vocals and guitar. The band quickly realized that Halifax did not provide immediate opportunities to play and record, so the band sent a demo tape to Aquarius Records. Company managers Terry Flood and Donald K. Tarlton returned a rejection letter but the members mistook it for an invitation. On April 1, 1970, April Wine went to Montreal, bringing with them their instruments and $100 in cash.
