Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy
"Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy" is the eighth track from the British rock band Queen's 1976 album A Day at the Races, written by Freddie Mercury. It was also featured as a track on the 1977 release Queen's First EP. It was one of several British music hall-inspired songs composed by members of the band. Background and composition The song begins with a piano and vocal introduction by Mercury, then continues, with the bass and drums adding on, at the start of the chorus. The second verse is sung, followed by another chorus. At this point, the drums, bass and guitar drop out, which then leads into the bridge, sung by Mercury and Mike Stone ("Hey boy where'd you get it from, Hey boy where did you go?"). Following the Brian May guitar solo, another verse is sung, and then the chorus ends the track. The song describes how "a good old-fashioned lover boy" is looking forward to a night of revelry and romance. Live performances and other appearances It was partially mimed by the band for the BBC and aired on Top of the Pops. The Top of the Pops version also has drummer Roger Taylor singing Mike Stone's line.
