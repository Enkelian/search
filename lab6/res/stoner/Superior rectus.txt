Superior rectus
The superior rectus muscle is a muscle in the orbit. It is one of the extraocular muscles. It is innervated by the superior division of the oculomotor nerve (Cranial Nerve III). In the primary position (looking straight ahead), the superior rectus muscle's primary function is elevation, although it also contributes to intorsion and adduction. Structure Function It elevates, adducts, and helps intort (rotate medially) the eye. Clinical significance Testing The superior rectus muscle is the only muscle that is capable of elevating the eye when it is in a fully abducted position.
