TG4
TG4 (Irish: TG Ceathair; pronounced [tʲeː ɟeː ˈcahəɾʲ] or [tiː d͡ʒiː ˈcahəɾʲ]) is a public service television channel which broadcasts through Irish and is available free-to-air across Ireland. The channel launched on 31 October 1996 and is available online and through its on demand service TG4 Player. TG4 was formerly known as Teilifís na Gaeilge or TnaG, before a rebranding campaign in 1999. TG4 was the third national station to be launched in Ireland, after RTÉ One in 1961 (as Teilifís Éireann) and RTÉ Two in 1978. It was followed by a fourth channel, TV3, in 1998. The channel has 650,000 viewers who tune into the channel each day to view a broad programming policy. It has been reported to have a share of 2% of the national television market in the Republic of Ireland and 3% of the national television market in Northern Ireland. The daily Irish-language programme schedule is its core service: seven hours of programming in Irish supported by a wide range of material in other languages, mostly English. TG4 launched its high-definition channel (TG4 HD) in 2012 on Virgin Media Ireland. Channels TG4 (launched 31 October 1996) TG4 HD (launched 2 October 2012) TG4 HD TG4
