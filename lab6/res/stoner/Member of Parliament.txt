A member of parliament (MP) is the representative of the voters to a parliament. In many countries with bicameral parliaments, this category includes specifically members of the lower house, as upper houses often have a different title. Member of Congress is an equivalent term in other jurisdictions. Members of parliament tend to form parliamentary groups (also called parliamentary parties) with members of the same political party.
