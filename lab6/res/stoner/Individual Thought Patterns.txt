Individual Thought Patterns
Individual Thought Patterns is the fifth studio album by American death metal band Death, released on June 22, 1993, by Relativity Records. It is the only album by the band to feature guitarist Andy LaRocque, the first to feature drummer Gene Hoglan and the second and last to feature bassist Steve DiGiorgio. Schuldiner's lyrics explore human facets including critiques of social norms, constructs and perceptions. This album contains the track "The Philosopher", for which a music video was made that received airplay on MTV and was even featured on, and comically panned by Beavis & Butthead, where the duo mistake the boy in the video for "Jeremy" from the Pearl Jam video and mock Schuldiner's vocals. According to Metal-Rules.com, the album is the 100th greatest heavy metal album of all time, as well as the 11th greatest extreme metal album of all time. The album is included in Guitar Player Magazine's Metal Guitar albums Top 20. The album was reissued and remixed by Relapse Records in October 2011.
