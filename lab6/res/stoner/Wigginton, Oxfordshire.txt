Wigginton, Oxfordshire
Wigginton is a village and civil parish about 6 miles (10 km) southwest of Banbury in Oxfordshire. The village is beside the River Swere, which forms the southern boundary of the parish. A Channel Four documentary, Hitler's British Girl, investigated the possibility that Unity Mitford gave birth to the son of Adolf Hitler in Hill View Cottage, Wigginton. The suggestion was not proven. Archaeology About 300 metres (330 yd) northeast of the parish church is the site of an Iron Age enclosure, on which a large Roman villa was added in about the 2nd century AD. The occupied part of the villa seems to have been reduced in size in the 4th century AD. The site is a scheduled monument. Parish church The nave and north and south aisles of the Church of England parish church of Saint Giles were built late in the 13th century. The chancel is early Decorated Gothic, built in about 1300. Each aisle is linked with the nave by an arcade of three bays. The Perpendicular Gothic porch and west tower were added in the 15th or late 14th century. The nave clerestory is also a Perpendicular addition. The tower and the clerestory are crenellated.
