Heidenheim (district)
Heidenheim is a Landkreis (district) in the east of Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from north clockwise) Ostalbkreis, Dillingen, Günzburg, Alb-Donau and Göppingen. History The district dates back to the Oberamt Heidenheim, which was created at the beginning of the 19th century. In 1808 it was enlarged by merging with the Oberamt Giengen. It was converted into a district in 1934/38, and enlarged by municipalities from the Oberamt Neresheim and the Oberamt Ulm. The communal reform of 1973 left the district virtually unchanged. Geography The district is located in the high plains of the Swabian Alb (Schwäbische Alb) mountains.
