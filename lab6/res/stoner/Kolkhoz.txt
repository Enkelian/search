Kolkhoz
A kolkhoz (Russian: колхо́з, IPA: [kɐlˈxos] (listen), a contraction of коллективное хозяйство, collective ownership, kollektivnoye khozaystvo) was a form of collective farm in the Soviet Union. Kolkhozes existed along with state farms or sovkhoz. These were the two components of the socialized farm sector that began to emerge in Soviet agriculture after the October Revolution of 1917, as an antithesis both to the feudal structure of impoverished serfdom and aristocratic landlords and to individual or family farming. The 1920s were characterized by spontaneous emergence of collective farms, under influence of traveling propaganda workers. Initially a collective farm resembled an updated version of the traditional Russian "commune", the generic "farming association" (zemledel’cheskaya artel’), the association for joint cultivation of land (TOZ), and finally the kolkhoz. This gradual shift to collective farming in the first 15 years after the October Revolution was turned into a "violent stampede" during the forced collectivization campaign that began in 1928 as means to countering "counterrevolutionary elements". Name The Russian portmanteau was adopted in other languages as a Russian word, however some other languages it was adopted as part of own culture, i.e. Ukrainian: колгосп, romanized: kolhósp, Belarusian: калгас, romanized: kalhas, Lithuanian: kolūkis, Estonian: kolhoos, Latvian: kolhozs.
