Extreme Championship Wrestling
HHG Corporation, d/b/a Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), is a defunct professional wrestling promotion that was founded in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1992 by Tod Gordon. In 1993, Scarsdale, New York native and businessman Paul Heyman took over the creative end of the promotion from Eddie Gilbert and rechristened the promotion from Eastern Championship Wrestling to "Extreme" Championship Wrestling. The promotion showcased various international styles of professional wrestling, ranging from lucha libre to puroresu and hardcore wrestling. Heyman's creative direction created new stars, and established the "third" big brand in the United States, competing with the billionaire-backed World Wrestling Federation and World Championship Wrestling promotions. HHG closed ECW in 2001 when it was unable to secure a new national television contract, and World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. purchased the assets of the company from bankruptcy in January 2003. After purchasing the assets of ECW, WWE relaunched the Extreme Championship Wrestling franchise as a third brand with their existing Raw and SmackDown brands. It debuted on June 13, 2006 on Sci Fi in the United States and ran for close to four years until it aired its final episode on February 16, 2010 on the rebranded Syfy.
