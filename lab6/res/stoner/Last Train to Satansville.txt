Last Train to Satansville
Last Train to Satansville is the sixth EP release by English alternative rock band Swervedriver. Produced by Alan Moulder and Swervedriver, the EP was promotionally released in 1993 through A&M Records with a digipak packaging. The lead track "Last Train to Satansville", which was included in the band's second studio album Mezcal Head, was also released as a single in 1994. The band's cover of The Who song, "In the City", was included in the 1993 tribute album, Who Covers Who?. Critical reception Andy Kellman of Allmusic regarded the tracks "Cars Converge on Paris" as "laggard and mediocre, but benefiting from a Wobble-type bassline and some nifty drum effects," while describing another track "The Hitcher" as "just as ace as anything found on Mezcal Head, including some lovely background vocals." Kellman also wrote that "In the City", a The Who cover, "repletes with vintage Shel Talmy-style production", commenting that "the band turned it into a five-minute, raging charger."
