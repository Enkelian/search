Model Nonprofit Corporation Act
The Model Nonprofit Corporation Act (MNCA) is model legislation prepared by the Nonprofit Organizations Committee of the Business Law Section of the American Bar Association. The MNCA is a model set of statutes governing nonprofit corporations proposed for adoption by state legislatures. This act was approved by the Business Law Section of the American Bar Association in 1964 and revised in 1987. There is currently a Revised Model Nonprofit Corporation Act in 2008. Many of the default procedures of the MNCA are different from standard parliamentary procedure, though they may be superseded by a provision either in the articles of incorporation or in the bylaws of the corporation.37 out of the 50 states have adopted a version of the MNCA. Eight of these states have adopted the law entirely: Arkansas, Indiana, Mississippi, Montana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Washington. As far as the states that have not adopted the MNCA, they follow for-profit business law for the state.
