Broadsheet
A broadsheet is the largest newspaper format and is characterized by long vertical pages (typically 22.5 in (57 cm)). Other common newspaper formats include the smaller Berliner and tabloid/compact formats. Description Many broadsheets measure roughly 29 1⁄2 by 23 1⁄2 in (749 by 597 mm) per full broadsheet spread, twice the size of a standard tabloid. Australian and New Zealand broadsheets always have a paper size of A1 per spread (841 by 594 mm or 33.1 by 23.4 in). South African broadsheet newspapers have a double-page spread sheet size of 820 by 578 mm (32.3 by 22.8 in) (single-page live print area of 380 x 545 mm). Others measure 22 in (560 mm) vertically. In the United States, the traditional dimensions for the front page half of a broadsheet are 15 in (381 mm) wide by 22 3⁄4 in (578 mm) long. However, in efforts to save newsprint costs, many U.S. newspapers have downsized to 12 in (305 mm) wide by 22 3⁄4 in (578 mm) long for a folded page.Many rate cards and specification cards refer to the "broadsheet size" with dimensions representing the front page "half of a broadsheet" size, rather than the full, unfolded broadsheet spread.
