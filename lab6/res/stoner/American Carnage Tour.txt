American Carnage Tour
The American Carnage Tour was a North American concert tour headlined by American thrash metal bands Slayer and Megadeth. The first leg of the tour took place from July 23 to September 4, 2010, and was supported by Testament. The second leg of the tour ran from September 24 to October 21, 2010, and was supported by Anthrax.The American Carnage tour marked the first time since the Clash of the Titans tour in 1990–1991 that Slayer, Megadeth, Testament and Anthrax toured together; unlike Clash of the Titans, however, this tour did not feature Suicidal Tendencies or Alice in Chains. Megadeth, Slayer and Testament were still touring in support of their respective albums World Painted Blood, Endgame and The Formation of Damnation, while Anthrax (who had just reunited with Joey Belladonna as their singer) were working on their tenth studio album Worship Music, which was released in the following year.
