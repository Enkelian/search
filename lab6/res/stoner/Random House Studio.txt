Random House Studio
Random House Studio is a production company responsible for adapting books published by Penguin Random House to film and TV. The company, originally owned by Penguin Random House, was transferred to Bertelsmann sister company FremantleMedia North America in 2016. Background Random House became involved in the home video market in the mid-1980s. Random House Home Video's first project was the acquirement of rights to seventeen years' worth of Sesame Street shows. This branch of Random House lasted until the 2000s. History Random House established a book-to-film unit, Random House Films, in 2005. A Focus Features deal and a co-finance plan for reasonably budgeted, adult-oriented movies were under development at the same time.Random House Films soon acquired the book and film rights to One Day from writer David Nicholls, allowing for simplified parallel development with an editor/producer. The book debuted in 2009, at the same time the film had begun production, and the film reached the screens in 2011. The film had a budget of $15 million and grossed $13.8 million domestically and $56.7 million globally; the book sold 1.5 million copies (with an additional 750 thousand copies of the movie edition). One Day was the film unit's most successful production.
