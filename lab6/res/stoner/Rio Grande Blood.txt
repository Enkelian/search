Rio Grande Blood
Rio Grande Blood is the tenth studio album by American industrial metal band Ministry, released in 2006. It is their first release through 13th Planet and Megaforce Records. Overview The album is the 2nd part of the band's anti-George W. Bush trilogy, preceded by 2004's Houses of the Molé and followed by 2007's The Last Sucker. The title of the album is a parody of the 1972 ZZ Top album Rio Grande Mud.Just like Houses of the Molé, Rio Grande Blood contains very political lyrics, making frequent allusions to the George W. Bush administration. The second track makes an explicit reference to Bush as Señor Peligro, which translates to "Mr. Danger" in Spanish. Some of the issues raised include the then-current Iraq War, U.S. immigration policy and U.S. military policy (particularly the US Marine Corps in the song "Gangreen"). The Halliburton corporation is also quoted and linked to the Bush administration. The album also contains allegations of the Bush administration complicity in the 9/11 attacks in the track "Lieslieslies," which contains audio samples from the conspiracy documentary Loose Change. The song received a nomination for Best Metal Performance at the 49th Grammy Awards.A remix of the song "The Great Satan"
