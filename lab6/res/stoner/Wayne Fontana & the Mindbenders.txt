Wayne Fontana & the Mindbenders
Wayne Fontana (born Glyn Geoffrey Ellis, 28 October 1945) is an English rock and pop singer, best known for the 1965 hit "Game of Love" with the Mindbenders. Biography Early years Fontana was born in Levenshulme, Manchester, Lancashire, and took his stage name from Elvis Presley's drummer, D. J. Fontana. In June 1963 he formed his backing group, The Mindbenders, and secured a recording contract, coincidentally, with Fontana Records. With the band Wayne Fontana released his biggest single "The Game of Love" and after several less successful singles he left the band in October 1965.Fontana remained under contract to the label after parting with The Mindbenders and soldiered on alone, using musicians working under the name of the Opposition, notably Frank Renshaw (lead guitar) (born 22 June 1943, Wythenshawe, Manchester), Bernie Burns (drums), Stuart Sirret (bass), and Phil Keen (drums), among others. Sometimes the band was billed as The Mindbenders, sometimes just as the Wayne Fontana Band. Struggling to achieve chart success Fontana's recorded a number of songs by outside writers with b-sides being mostly his own compositions. Fontana's biggest solo single became "Pamela, Pamela" written by Graham Gouldman, it reached #5 in the Australia (Kent Music Report) and #11
