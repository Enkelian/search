NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps, known informally as the NOAA Corps, is one of eight federal uniformed services of the United States, and operates under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), a scientific agency overseen by the Department of Commerce. The NOAA Corps is made up of scientifically and technically trained officers and is the smallest of the U.S. uniformed services. It is one of only two – the other being the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps – that consists only of commissioned officers, with no enlisted or warrant officer ranks. The NOAA Corps primary mission is to monitor oceanic conditions, support major waterways, and monitor atmospheric conditions. The NOAA Corps traces its origins to the establishment of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps on May 22, 1917, which the service recognizes as its official birthday. The Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps became the Environmental Science Services Administration Corps (ESSA Corps) in 1965, which in turn became the NOAA Corps in 1970.
