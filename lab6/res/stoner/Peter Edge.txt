Peter Edge
Peter Edge is an English American record executive. He is the chairman and CEO of RCA Records. Early life and education Edge was born near Coventry, England. Fueled in part by his sister’s record collection – which included influential records by Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding, and Marvin Gaye—he developed an early passion for music. As a university student at Coventry Polytechnic, Edge dj’d at local radio stations, clubs and parties and formed a friendship with 2 Tone and The Special AKA founder, Jerry Dammers. He graduated with honors and earned a degree in Communication Studies, which required coursework in film, art, psychology and sociology. Career Following his graduation, Edge moved to London, where he was hired as a music researcher for Channel Four’s television series Switch. He booked up-and-coming artists such as Sade and Grace Jones for Switch, and was hired by Simon Fuller to work a side gig as an A&R representative for Chrysalis Music Publishing. As he gained recognition for his “ears,” he was invited to meet with Doug D’arcy, then the head of Chrysalis Records. Edge had planned to pitch D’Arcy on creating another music program for television, but was instead recruited to start a label. In
