Radio Bam
Radio Bam (or Bam Radio) was a Sirius Radio Station hosted by professional skateboarder and Jackass cast member Bam Margera that aired on Mondays at 7pm, straight after The Jason Ellis Show. The show's supporting cast was originally made up of Margera's fellow CKY crew members Brandon Dicamillo and Brandon Novak, who appeared on most episodes of the show's early years, with frequent guest appearances from Ryan Dunn, Rake Yohn and Chris Raab as well as Bam's parents April Margera and Phil Margera, uncle Don Vito and occasional appearances from the Jackass crew. A recurring feature on the show was DiCamillo's freestyle raps which often poked fun at Rake by insinuating he was gay and the show frequently came under fire for its use of sexist and homophobic language. DiCamillo would also spend entire shows impersonating Rake for episodes where he was not present and the crew would often infuriate Rake by giving out his phone number live on air leading to hundreds of messages being left on his voicemail. The show would often feature lengthy discussions about Novak's most recent sexual conquests and Bam would also take phonecalls from listeners calling up to insult the show or the crew
