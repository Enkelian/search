Upside Down (The Jesus and Mary Chain song)
"Upside Down" is the first single from the Scottish alternative rock band The Jesus and Mary Chain. The song was written by William Reid and Jim Reid, and was produced by The Jesus and Mary Chain. The b-side is a cover of a Syd Barrett song and was produced by Joe Foster. It is the band's only early period release for the Creation Records label. And with about 50,000 copies sold it was the first success for the label.The sleeves for the first 1.000 copies (in black with red words and an address to write to the band under the credits) were printed by Bobby Gillespie (the next drummer in the band) in Glasgow, and featured handwritten messages from the group. Subsequent copies (without the band address) were produced in several color variations including red, yellow, blue and pink. In 1985 the single was re-released with a totally different sleeve but same catalogue number.
