Haute-Corse
Haute-Corse (French pronunciation: ​[ot.kɔʁs]; Corsican: Corsica suprana, Cismonte or Alta Corsica; English: Upper Corsica) is an administrative department of France, consisting of the northern part of the island of Corsica. The corresponding departmental territorial collectivity merged with that of Corse-du-Sud on 1 January 2018, forming the single territorial collectivity of Corsica, with territorial elections coinciding with the dissolution of the separate councils. The people living in the former department are called "Northerners" (Supranacci). History The department was formed on 15 September 1975, when the department of Corsica was divided into Upper Corsica (Haute-Corse) and South Corsica (Corse-du-Sud). The department corresponds exactly to the former department of Golo, which existed between 1793 and 1811. On 6 July 2003, a referendum on increased autonomy was voted down by a very thin majority: 50.98 percent against to 49.02 percent for. This was a major setback for French Minister of the Interior Nicolas Sarkozy, who had hoped to use Corsica as the first step in his decentralization policies. Geography The former department is surrounded on three sides by the Mediterranean Sea and on the south by the department of Corse-du-Sud.
