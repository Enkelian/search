Nippon Budokan
Nippon Budokan (日本武道館, Nippon Budōkan), often shortened to simply Budokan, is an indoor arena located in Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan. Budokan was originally built for the judo competition in the 1964 Summer Olympics, hence its name, which translates in English as Martial Arts Hall. Its primary purpose is to host martial arts contests and for a time was a popular venue for Japanese professional wrestling. It has hosted numerous other sporting events such as the 1967 Women's Volleyball World Championship and other events such as musical concerts. A number of famous rock music acts have played at Budokan, such as Tina Turner in 1985. The Beatles were the first rock group to play there, in a series of concerts held between June 30 and July 2, 1966. Another big act to enter the stage at Budokan were ABBA. They ended their last tour there, ABBA: The Tour. Their final show, on March 27, 1980, also came to be the last live concert they did together. Several live albums were recorded at Budokan, including releases by Bryan Adams, Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, Cheap Trick, Dream Theater, John Hiatt, Kiss, Mr. Big, Ozzy Osbourne, Judas Priest, Journey and Deep Purple.
