Professional Performing Arts School
The Professional Performing Arts School, colloquially known as PPAS, is a public school in Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, New York City. History PPAS was created in 1990 to meet the needs of two groups of students: those who wanted to pursue professional work in the arts as they earned a junior/senior high school diploma and those who wanted to study the arts as an avocation.It is the special mission of this small, personalized school to develop, refine, and showcase students in dance, drama, and vocal music while also providing them with a rigorous, meaningful academic curriculum. Every student auditions for a performing arts major. Performing arts instruction is delivered by professional dancers, actors and musicians through professional studios. Academic staff gives students opportunities for daily study through a rigorous, comprehensive, sequential, fully integrated academic curriculum. The course of study, ending in a New York State Regents endorsed diploma, is centered on an interdisciplinary, multicultural, inquiry based approach to learning which prepares students for college and/or a professional career in the arts.
