National Geographic Society – Palomar Observatory Sky Survey
The National Geographic Society – Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (NGS-POSS) was a major astronomical survey, that took almost 2,000 photographic plates of the night sky. It was conducted at Palomar Observatory, California, United States, and completed by the end of 1958. Observations The photographs were taken with the 48-inch Samuel Oschin telescope at Palomar Observatory, and the astronomical survey was funded by a grant from the National Geographic Society to the California Institute of Technology. Among the primary minds behind the project were Edwin Hubble, Milton L. Humason, Walter Baade, Ira Sprague Bowen and Rudolph Minkowski. The first photographic plate was exposed on November 11, 1949. 99% of the plates were taken by June 20, 1956, but the final 1% was not completed until December 10, 1958.The survey utilized 14-inch square photographic plates, covering about 6° of sky per side (approximately 36 square degrees per plate). Each region of the sky was photographed twice, once using a red sensitive Kodak 103a-E plate, and once with a blue sensitive Kodak 103a-O plate. This allowed the color of celestial objects to be recorded. The survey was originally meant to cover the sky from the north celestial pole to -24° declination. This figure
