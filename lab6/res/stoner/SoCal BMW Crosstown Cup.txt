SoCal BMW Crosstown Cup
The SoCal BMW Crosstown Cup is a year-long all-sports college competition between the UCLA Bruins and the USC Trojans. While UCLA and USC have had a sports rivalry since the 1920s, the official yearly head-to-head all-sports competition began with the 2001–2002 season as the Lexus Gauntlet. After the 2008–2009 season, Lexus' sponsorship ended. For the next five seasons USC and UCLA continued to keep track of the scores and yearly winners. Without an official sponsor, the competition was referred to as the Crosstown Gauntlet from fall 2009 to spring 2014. Starting with the 2014–2015 season, the series was sponsored by The Southern California BMW Centers and renamed the SoCal BMW Crosstown Cup.During the original Lexus sponsorship, a Northern California version of the Gauntlet was held between Stanford University and University of California, Berkeley for three seasons. Scoring Structure Points are awarded for each NCAA-sanctioned sport that the two schools compete face each other in. Each of the 19 varsity sports that the two schools compete against each other in are worth 10 points in total. All regular season and postseason head-to-head competition in a single sport counts as a series, and all of the points for that sport are awarded
