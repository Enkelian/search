Asking for It (Hole song)
"Asking for It" is a song by the American alternative rock band Hole. It is the fourth track on the band's second studio album, Live Through This, released on April 12, 1994 on Geffen Records. The song was written by vocalist and rhythm guitarist Courtney Love and lead guitarist Eric Erlandson. Although not released as a single, "Asking for It" is one of the band's most notable songs as it charted a brief, four-week appearance on Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks in the United States in February 1995, peaking at number 36. It is also known as one of the three released Hole recordings to feature Love's husband Kurt Cobain. Origin and recording "Asking for It" was one of the many songs written by Love and Erlandson following the release of Hole's debut studio album, Pretty on the Inside, and the subsequent departures of drummer Caroline Rue and bassist Jill Emery. Although thought to be written in 1992, the term "asking for it" was coined by Love as early as 1990 and appears in the lyrics to the band's 1991 single "Dicknail". The opening lines of the song were used by Love in a 1991 interview with British journalist Everett True,
