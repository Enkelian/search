Ah! Leah!
"Ah! Leah!" is a song by Mark Avsec and American rock musician Donnie Iris from the latter's 1980 album Back on the Streets. It was released as a single in late 1980 and reached number 29 on the US Billboard Hot 100, 22 on the Cash Box Top 100 and 19 on the US Billboard Top Tracks chart. The song has been described as Iris's signature song and was most popular in Canada, where it became a Top 10 hit.Eight musicians appeared in early live performances of the song, including lead singer Iris, a drummer, three guitar players, a keyboard player and at least two backing vocalists, one female and one male. The title of the song has been referred to in the form of puns on a few of Iris's later albums â€” the 2009 live album Ah! Live! and the 2010 Christmas album Ah! Leluiah!. Electric Six covered the song on their cover-album Mimicry and Memories (2015). Chart performance Album appearances Back on the Streets, 1980 Out of the Blue, 1992 Live!
