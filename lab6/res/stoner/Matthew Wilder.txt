Matthew Wilder
Matthew Wilder (born Matthew Weiner; January 24, 1953) is an American musician, singer, and record producer. In early 1984, his single "Break My Stride" hit #2 on the Cash Box chart and #5 on the Billboard Hot 100. Career Born in New York City, Wilder was one-half of the Greenwich Village folk group Matthew & Peter in the 1970s. In 1978 he moved to Los Angeles, California, and sang for television commercials and as a backing vocalist for Rickie Lee Jones and Bette Midler. Wilder's debut album, I Don't Speak the Language (1983), reached #49 on the Billboard 200, fueled by "Break My Stride". Wilder had some continued success with the single "The Kid's American", which reached #33 in 1984, but the single failed to match the success of "Break My Stride". Wilder's second album, Bouncin' Off the Walls (1984), failed to gain much momentumâ€”even with an innovative music video for the single "Bouncin' Off the Walls", with only the title track making the charts (No. 52), and was subsequently deemed a commercial failure. Despite the downturn in his solo career, Wilder continued his career in the music industry as a songwriter and as a record producer for such acts
