John Joly
John Joly FRS (1 November 1857 – 8 December 1933) was an Irish physicist and professor of geology at the University of Dublin famous for his development of radiotherapy in the treatment of cancer. He is also known for developing techniques to estimate accurately the age of a geological period, based on radioactive elements present in minerals, the uranium–thorium dating. Career Joly was born in Holywood House (the Church of Ireland Rectory), Bracknagh, County Offaly, Ireland. He was a second cousin of Charles Jasper Joly, the astronomer. He entered Trinity College, Dublin in 1876, graduating in Engineering in 1882 in first place with various special certificates in branches of engineering, at the same time obtaining a First Class Honours in modern literature. He worked as a demonstrator in Trinity's Engineering and Physics departments before succeeding William Johnson Sollas in the Chair of Geology and Mineralogy in 1897, a position which he held until his death in 1933 in Dublin. Scientific work Joly joined the Royal Dublin Society in 1881 while still a student, and was a frequent contributor of papers.
