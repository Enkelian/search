Mushroom (song)
"Mushroom" is a song by the German krautrock band Can, from their 1971 album Tago Mago. It's the shortest song on the album, with a duration of 4 minutes and 8 seconds. A video was made for the track which has been shown on MTV. Content The song has a hypnotic and repetitive structure. Vocalist Damo Suzuki repeats the phrase "When I saw mushroom head / I was born, I was dead" and "When I saw skies are red / I was born, I was dead" during the verses. For the chorus, he yells "I'm gonna give my despair". It has been suggested that the song refers to an atomic bomb blast and the feeling of despair. This is reinforced by the sound of a bomb explosion that abruptly ends the song. It has also been suggested that the lyrics refer to psilocybin mushrooms, which can give users psychedelic visions of rebirth.
