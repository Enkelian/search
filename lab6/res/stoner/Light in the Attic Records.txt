History Already in highschool, Sullivan was interested in starting his own label. "I always wanted my own label," Sullivan told The Stranger in 2006, "but it was always the wrong time." After high school and college at the University of Arizona, Sullivan interned for Seattle, Washington-based record labels like Sub Pop and the now-defunct Loosegroove Records. Susie Tennant, Sub Pop’s then radio-promotions director, offered Sullivan a chance to intern with Madrid, Spain-based record label, Munster Records. Munster Records focused primarily on reissues of bands like The Stooges and Spacemen 3, inspiring Sullivan to begin rethinking his own concept behind the still active idea of starting a record label.Upon Sullivan’s return to the states he began producing live shows in the Seattle area
