Foreign, Comparative, and International Law Librarian
Foreign, comparative, and international law librarians, also known as FCIL librarians, are law librarian specialists who work specifically with three primary varieties of extra-jurisdictional law. FCIL librarians work with foreign law, comparative law, and international law. Foreign laws are the laws of any international jurisdiction. Comparative laws are “the scholarly study of the similarities and differences between the legal systems of different jurisdictions.” International law is the law of international organizations, such as the United Nations, and the laws between nations, such as those established by treaty. == References ==
