Kalimantan
Kalimantan is the Indonesian portion of the island of Borneo. It comprises 73% of the island's area. The non-Indonesian parts of Borneo are Brunei and East Malaysia. In Indonesia, "Kalimantan" refers to the whole island of Borneo. In 2019, the Indonesian President Joko Widodo proposed that Indonesia's capital be moved to Kalimantan. Etymology The name Kalimantan, which is often spelled Klemantan, was derived from the Sanskrit word Kalamanthana, which means "burning weather island", or island with a very hot temperature, to describe its hot and humid tropical climate. It consists of the two words kal[a] ("time, season, period") and manthan[a] ("boiling, churning, burning"). Its association with the island and its peoples has also been attributed to British scientist and colonial administrator Charles Hose from the early 20th century. However this term referring to a supposed Klemantan people has since been discontinued as it has been deemed to be an invented term of convenience that does not properly represent the people it claims to describe. Area The Indonesian territory makes up 73% of the island by area, and 69.5% (13,772,543 at the 2010 Census of Indonesia) by population. The non-Indonesian parts of Borneo are of Brunei (400,000) and East Malaysia (5,625,000),
