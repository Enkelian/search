1TYM
1TYM (Korean: 원타임, pronounced as "One Time") is a four-member South Korean hip hop group. They are Oh Jinhwan, Park Hong-jun (also known as Teddy Park), Song Baekyoung, and Im Taebin (also known as Danny). History Teddy and Danny grew up in Los Angeles and were discovered there when they were teenagers by a producer who worked with Yang Hyun-suk. After auditioning for Yang, the two were signed to his new label, YG Entertainment, and moved to South Korea. Teddy, Danny, and rappers Jinhwan and Baekyoung debuted as 1TYM in 1998 with the album, One Time for Your Mind. It was one of the best-selling albums of the year and won several major awards. Hiatus 1TYM went on hiatus in 2006 due to Oh's mandatory military service. Although they never officially disbanded they have not been active as a group since then. Their last performance was in 2008, when they were guests for BIGBANG's Japan Concert "Stand Up". Oh and Song both left the entertainment industry and have since married and started their own families. Song most recently made an appearance on Radio Star alongside fellow first-generation singers Joon Park and Kim Tae-woo of g.o.d and Jun Jin of Shinhwa.
