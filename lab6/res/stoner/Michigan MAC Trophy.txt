Michigan MAC Trophy
The Michigan MAC Trophy is given to the Mid-American Conference (MAC) university from Michigan – Central Michigan University (CMU), Eastern Michigan University (EMU) and Western Michigan University (WMU) – which has the best head-to-head record in each season of each sport. There are two separate trophies, one for football and the other for men's basketball. It is one of a handful of trophies in college sports contested between three teams; others are the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy and the irregularly awarded Florida Cup and Beehive Boot; the Sgt. York Trophy is contested between four teams. In the event of a tie the Michigan MAC Trophy remains with the previous holder until one of the other rivals claims the title. This happened with both trophies in 2008, when each team finished 2–2 in men's basketball and 1–1 in football; Western Michigan retained the men's basketball trophy and Eastern Michigan retained the football trophy. It also happened in 2012 with the football trophy, when EMU retained it. Western Michigan has won the most total trophies with 13, 7 in basketball and 6 in football. Western Michigan currently holds the football trophy and Eastern Michigan the men's basketball trophy. History The Michigan MAC Trophy was
