Eternity (Anathema album)
Eternity is the third album by the British rock band Anathema. It was released on 11 November 1996 through Peaceville Records. Background Eternity moves away from the death-doom style of Anathema's first two albums, featuring heavier use of keyboards and mostly clean vocals. It features a version of Roy Harper's track "Hope". It is the last album with drummer John Douglas before his return to the band in 1998. Track listing Personnel == References ==
