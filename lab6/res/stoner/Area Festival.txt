Area Festival
The Area Festival was a music festival founded by popular electronic musician Moby, who asserted that he was "in large part, inspired by the ethos of Lollapalooza", and wished to create a similarly "genuinely eclectic, interesting, alternative music festival". Moby organized the first such festival, called Area:One in 2001, and the sequel tour Area2, in 2002. The festival is currently on indefinite hiatus. The festival featured diverse genres of music. Besides headliner Moby, the main stage mostly featured rock and pop acts. The second stage was an air-conditioned tent where electronic, dance and smaller bands performed. Acts The 2001 Area:One acts included Moby, OutKast, New Order, Carl Cox, Nelly Furtado, Incubus, Paul Oakenfold, The Roots, The Orb and Rinôçérôse. The 2002 Area2 acts included Moby and David Bowie in alternating headlining slots: as well as Ash, Blue Man Group, and Busta Rhymes. The festival also featured a DJ tent with a rotating list of artists. The main sponsors for the tour were Intel, KMX, and Pepsi.
