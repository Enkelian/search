Jackson College
Jackson College is a public college in Jackson County, Michigan. Originally established as Jackson Junior College in 1928, Jackson County electors voted to reincorporate the institution as a Community College District under the "Public Act 188 of 1955" in 1962. In 1964 voters approved a charter millage that continues to indefinitely fund the college. In June 2013, the board of trustees approved an official name change from Jackson Community College to Jackson College. Jackson College has been accredited by the Higher Learning Commission since 1933 and offers 48 associate degrees, certificate programs, and transfer options to Jackson County and Michigan residents. Today, the College has a yearly enrollment of nearly 8,000 students between its several locations; Central Campus located in Summit Township, the Flight Center at the Jackson County Airport, the William Maher campus on the north side of town near Interstate 94 (I-94), JC @ LISD TECH (vocational-technical school) in Adrian, and the LeTarte Hillsdale Center in Hillsdale, as well as online programs. The college's Board of Trustees is composed of seven members elected at-large for six-year terms. The board uses a Policy Governance methodology popularized by John Carver. The board chairman is Samuel Barnes. Jackson College's Central Campus
