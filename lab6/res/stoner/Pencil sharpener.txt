Pencil sharpener
A pencil sharpener (also referred to as pencil pointer or in Ireland as a parer or topper) is a tool for sharpening a pencil's writing point by shaving away its worn surface. Pencil sharpeners may be operated manually or by an electric motor. It is common for many sharpeners to have a casing around them, which can be removed for emptying the pencil shavings debris into a trash bin. History Before the development of dedicated pencil sharpeners, a pencil was sharpened by whittling it with a knife. Pencil sharpener tools made this task much easier and gave a more uniform result. The development of pencil sharpeners began in France. In a French book from 1822 was reported in detail about an invention of Mr. C. A. Boucher (Paris) for construction of a pencil sharpener. He was working with pantographs and apparently needed a device to precisely sharpen the pencils. The device of Mr. Boucher was technically sensible and functional. His idea was also internationally known and recognized, as shown by corresponding reports in German literature at this time. But Mr. Boucher has not applied a patent for his pencil sharpener. A commercial use of his inventions is unlikely. French mathematician
