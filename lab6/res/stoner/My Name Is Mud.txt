My Name Is Mud
"My Name Is Mud" is a song by the American rock band Primus and is the first single from the 1993 album Pork Soda. The lyrics are written from the point of view of a blue-collar man, Aloysius Devandander "Mud" Abercrombie, who has killed his friend after an argument and is now trying to bury him. The song samples the line "Where are you goin' city boy?" from the film Deliverance. The track's title refers to a common derogatory phrase that implies its recipient is "a stupid, twaddling fellow".During the band's Woodstock '94 Music Festival performance Primus were pelted with mud while they performed the song. About a minute into "My Name Is Mud" the band stopped playing, and Primus frontman Les Claypool said, "Well I opened a big-ass can of worms with that one, didn't I? The song is called 'My Name Is Mud', but keep the mud to yourselves you son-of-a-bitch."In 2010, Primus released a new version of the track sung entirely in Spanish under the title "Me Llamo Mud".
