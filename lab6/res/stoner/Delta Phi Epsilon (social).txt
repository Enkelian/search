Delta Phi Epsilon (social)
Delta Phi Epsilon (ΔΦΕ or DPhiE) is an international sorority founded on March 17, 1917 at New York University Law School in Manhattan. It is one of 26 social sororities that form the National Panhellenic Conference. It has 109 active chapters, two of which are located in Canada, making the sorority an international organization. The current international executive director is Nicole DeFeo (Phi Tau- Rutgers University-Camden). History On March 17, 1917, at the New York University School of Law, Dorothy Cohen Schwartzman, Ida Bienstock Landau, Minna Goldsmith Mahler, Eve Effron Robin, and Sylvia Steierman Cohn made a pledge to each other to build a women's organization that would stand out from the rest. They could not find a membership accepting of all backgrounds so they formed Delta Phi Epsilon with the purpose of accepting all races and religions—one of the first non-sectarian, social sororities to do so. These five women founded the Alpha chapter of the Delta Phi Epsilon Sorority to "promote good fellowship among the women students among the various colleges in the country...to create a secret society composed of these women based upon their good moral character, regardless of nationality or creed...to have distinct chapters at various colleges".Five
