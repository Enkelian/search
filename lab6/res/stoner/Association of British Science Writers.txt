Association of British Science Writers
The Association of British Science Writers (ABSW) is the UK society for science writers, science journalists and science communicators. Founded in 1947, the ABSW exists to help those who write about science and technology, and to improve the standard of science journalism in the UK. Mission and vision Mission: ABSW champions independence and excellence in the reporting of science, medicine, engineering and technology. Vision: "For science and technology to truly benefit society they need to be clearly communicated but also held accountable. We need both explanatory and investigative journalists who are free to report clearly, accurately and to the highest professional standards: journalists who are independent, honest and unbiased, and who are not afraid to challenge the information they are given. The ABSW strives to help create a world where this is the norm, where media professionals are free to responsibly and critically report on any aspect of science, to do so openly and safely, and to be paid fairly for their work. We want to help build a society that encourages and values open, independent, objective and fair assessment of science and its role in society, and rewards diversity, originality and flair in reporting."
