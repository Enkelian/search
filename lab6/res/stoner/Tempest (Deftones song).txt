Tempest (Deftones song)
"Tempest" is the second single by Sacramento, California-based alternative metal band Deftones, from their seventh studio album, Koi No Yokan. The song debuted on PureVolume's official website on October 3, 2012 along with a video featuring band members Chino Moreno and Sergio Vega giving some insight regarding the track. The song's lyrical content is representative of the supposed end of the world that would have occurred on December 21, 2012, according to various myths related to the Mayan calendar. It was featured in the trailer for the film Jack the Giant Slayer and an episode of The Following and in the film Furious 7. Peaking at No. 3 on the US Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks, Tempest became Deftones' most successful single on that chart, surpassing "Change (In the House of Flies)", which peaked at No. 9 in 2001. The song has been described as post-metal.
