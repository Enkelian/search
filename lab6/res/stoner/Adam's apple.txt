Adam's apple
The Adam's apple, or laryngeal prominence, is a feature of the human neck, and is the lump or protrusion formed by the angle of the thyroid cartilage surrounding the larynx seen especially in males. Structure The structure of the Adam's apple forms a bump under the skin. It is typically larger in adult males, in whom it is usually clearly visible and palpable. In females, the bump is much less visible and is hardly perceived on the upper edge of the thyroid cartilage. Sex difference An Adam's apple is usually a feature of adult males, because its size in males tends to increase considerably during puberty.Its development is considered a secondary sexual characteristic of males that appears as a result of hormonal activity. Function The Adam's apple, in relation with the thyroid cartilage which forms it, helps protect the walls and the frontal part of the larynx, including the vocal cords (which are located directly behind it). Another function of the Adam's apple is related to the deepening of the voice. During adolescence, the thyroid cartilage grows together with the larynx. Consequently, the laryngeal prominence grows in size mainly in men. Together, a larger soundboard is made up in phonation
