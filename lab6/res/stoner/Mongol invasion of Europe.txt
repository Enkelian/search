Mongol invasion of Europe
The Mongol invasion of Europe in the 13th century was the conquest of much of Europe by the Mongol Empire. The first wave of invasions occurred from the 1220s into the 1240s. In Eastern Europe, the Mongols destroyed Volga Bulgaria, Cumania, and Russian principalities such as Kiev and Vladimir. In Central Europe, the Mongol armies launched a two-pronged invasion of fragmented Poland, culminating in the Battle of Legnica (9 April 1241), and the Kingdom of Hungary, culminating in the Battle of Mohi (11 April 1241). Invasions also were launched into the Caucasus against the Kingdom of Georgia and the Chechens and Ingush. The operations were planned by General Subutai (1175–1248) and commanded by Batu Khan (c. 1207–1255) and Kadan (d. c. 1261). Both men were grandsons of Genghis Khan. Their conquests integrated much European territory into the empire of the Golden Horde. Warring European princes realized they had to cooperate in the face of a Mongol invasion, so local wars and conflicts were suspended in parts of central Europe, only to be resumed after the Mongols had withdrawn. After the initial invasions, subsequent raids and punitive expeditions continued into the late 13th century. Invasions and conquest of Rus' lands Ögedei
