Fallout (Front Line Assembly album)
Fallout is a remix album by Vancouver industrial band Front Line Assembly, released in 2007. Initially announced as an EP, it is a collection of nine remixes by both the band themselves and other artists as well as three previously unreleased tracks. Background According to Jeremy Inkel, "Electric Dreams" and "Unconscious" are songs that were originally meant for the Artificial Soldier album, but left unfinished until after. Band leader Bill Leeb later expressed his dissatisfaction with the release, saying, "We weren't that happy with Fallout even though it was more of a friendship remix CD." Touring After having postponed the tour because of the later than planned release of the album the band toured North America and Europe in support of Fallout. The North American leg comprised dates in April and May 2007. The band were accompanied by American industrial rock band Acumen Nation as supporting act until May 8, American new wave band and Metropolis label mates TheStart joined on 2 May 2007 for the remainder of the tour. Front Line Assembly continued their tour in Europe in June and July 2007 where British industrial band Portion Control acted as support. Critical reception David Jeffries of Allmusic called Fallout
