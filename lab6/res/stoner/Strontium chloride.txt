Strontium chloride
Strontium chloride (SrCl2) is a salt of strontium and chloride. It is a typical salt, forming neutral aqueous solutions. Like all compounds of Sr, this salt emits a bright red colour in a flame; in fact it is used as a source of redness in fireworks. Its chemical properties are intermediate between those for barium chloride, which is more toxic, and calcium chloride. Preparation Strontium chloride can be prepared by treating strontium hydroxide or strontium carbonate with hydrochloric acid: Sr(OH)2 + 2 HCl → SrCl2 + 2 H2OCrystallization from cold aqueous solution gives the hexahydrate, SrCl2·6H2O. Dehydration of this salt occurs in stages, commencing above 61 °C (142 °F). Full dehydration occurs at 320 °C (608 °F). Structure The solid adopts a deformed rutile structure. In the vapour phase the SrCl2 molecule is non-linear with a Cl-Sr-Cl angle of approximately 130°. This is an exception to VSEPR theory which would predict a linear structure. Ab initio calculations have been cited to propose that contributions from d orbitals in the shell below the valence shell are responsible. Another proposal is that polarisation of the electron core of the strontium atom causes a distortion of the core electron density that interacts with
