14 Years
"14 Years" is the second track on the Guns N' Roses album Use Your Illusion II. Background The song is one of the few Guns N' Roses tunes sung almost entirely by Izzy Stradlin with Axl Rose singing the chorus."14 Years" was only performed live when Stradlin was still in the band. It has been speculated to be about Rose's and Stradlin's friendship, with people pointing out that they'd known each other for 14 years by the time the song was supposedly written. But this has never been confirmed by the band.An earlier demo had different lyrics with the first verse and the chorus slightly modified, while the second and third verses were given a complete makeover. Parts of the demo's second verse would be used in the third verse of the final version, while the third verse is a slightly modified version of the demo's first verse.The song was part of the set list at a few live concerts in 2012 featuring Izzy Stradlin.
