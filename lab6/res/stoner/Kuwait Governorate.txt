Kuwait Governorate
The Kuwait Governorate (Arabic: محافظة الكويت‎) was the 19th governorate of Iraq established in the aftermath of the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq in 1990. It was preceded by the brief puppet state of the Republic of Kuwait. The Kuwait Governorate consisted of most of the occupied Kuwaiti territory, with the exclusion of the northern areas which became the Saddamiyat al-Mitla' District. Saddam Hussein's relative, Ali Hassan Majid became the governor of this province. Iraq's refusal to withdraw from Kuwait led to the Gulf War and the eventual return of the pre-occupation Kuwaiti government on 28 February 1991. == References ==
