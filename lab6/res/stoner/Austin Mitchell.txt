Austin Vernon Mitchell (born 19 September 1934) is a British Labour Party politician who was the Member of Parliament for Great Grimsby from a 1977 by-election to 2015. He is the Chair of the Labour Euro-Safeguards Campaign. Early life, education and educating others Born in Bradford, Mitchell elder son of Richard Vernon Mitchell and Ethel Mary Butterworth was educated at Woodbottom Council School in Baildon, Bingley Grammar School, the University of Manchester where he read History, and Nuffield College, Oxford, doctoral thesis "The Whigs in opposition, 1815–1830" in 1963.From 1959–63, he lectured in history at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand. While lecturing in politics from 1963–67, at the University of Canterbury, Mitchell wrote a popular book about New Zealand, The Half Gallon Quarter Acre Pavlova Paradise (1972). The book title became a phrase in the New Zealand English lexicon. In the 1960s and 70s, New Zealand remained a milder version of the socialist laboratory it had been since 1935. In the 80s and 90s, the same socialist Labour party's government transformed it into an open market economy. These drastic changes provided ample subject matter for social analysis and, 30 years later, Mitchell wrote Pavlova Paradise Revisited (2002)
