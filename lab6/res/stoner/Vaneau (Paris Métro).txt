Vaneau (Paris Métro)
Vaneau ([vano]) is a station on Line 10 of the Paris Metro, located on the border of the 6th and 7th arrondissements. History The station was opened by the Compagnie du chemin de fer métropolitain de Paris on 30 December 1923 as part of the first section of the Ligne circulaire intérieure (inner circular line) from Invalides (now on Line 13) to Croix-Rouge (a station east of Sèvres – Babylone, which was closed during World War II) via Duroc. This project was eventually abandoned and on 27 July 1937, the section from Duroc to Invalides was transferred to become the first section of the old Line 14, which was connected under the Seine and incorporated into Line 13 on 9 November 1976. The station is a reference to Rue Vaneau, which is named after Louis Vaneau (1811–1830), a student killed during the July Revolution. Station layout References Roland, Gérard (2003).
