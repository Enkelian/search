Arnold Bakery
The Arnold Bakery Building is a historic commerce building in east-central Austin, Texas constructed around 1890. In addition to being a bakery, the building served many other purposes throughout the 20th century for the African-American community before falling into disrepair. In 2000, the building was bought and renovated for a design studio as part of a local urban renewal project. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.
