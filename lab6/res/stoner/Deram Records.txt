Deram Records
Deram Records was a subsidiary record label of Decca Records established in the United Kingdom in 1966. At the time, U.K. Decca was a different company from the Decca label in the United States, which was owned by MCA Inc. Deram recordings were distributed in the U.S. through UK Decca's American branch known as London Records. Deram was active until 1979, then continued as a reissue label. 1966â€“1968 In the 1960s Decca recording engineers experimented with ways of improving stereo recordings. They created a technique called "Decca Panoramic Sound." The term "Deramic" was created as abbreviation of this. The new concept allowed for more space between instruments, rendering these sounds softer to the ear. Early stereo recordings of popular music usually were mixed with sounds to the hard left, center, or hard right only. This was because of the technical limitations of the professional 4-track reel-to-reel recorders which were state of the art until about 1967. Decca initially conceived Deram Records as an outlet for Deramic Sound recordings of contemporary pop and rock music, but not all of the early recordings on Deram used this technique. 'Deramic Sound' was intended to create recordings that had a more natural stereo spread.
