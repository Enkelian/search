Diboron tetrachloride
Diboron tetrachloride is a chemical compound with the formula B2Cl4. It is a colorless liquid. The electrical discharge procedure of boron trichloride can be divided into three steps: Synthesis The modern synthesis involves dechlorination of boron trichloride using copper. It can also be formed by the electrical discharge procedure of boron trichloride at low temperatures. BCl3 → BCl2 + Cl Cl + Hg (electrode) → HgCl or HgCl2 2 BCl2 → B2Cl4 Reactions The compound is used as a reagent for the synthesis of organoboron compounds. For instance, diboron tetrachloride reacts with ethylene: CH2=CH2 + B2Cl4 → Cl2B–CH2–CH2–BCl2The compound absorbs hydrogen quickly at room temperature: 3 B2Cl4 + 3 H2 → B2H6 + 4 BCl3 == References ==
