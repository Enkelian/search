Monotrona
Monotrona was a one-woman musical/performance group active from 1996 to 2003 founded by Jodie Baltazar, also known as Jodie Mechanic. Monotrona performed in costume and in character as one of many self-styled Superbeings or Fourteen Impersonations of Man These Superbeings took the form of marginally or partially human figures such as apes, robots, ghosts, madmen, or giants with the additional perk that they possessed (or thought they possessed) superhuman powers. All told, Monotrona evoked eight of these impersonations: Gorditz from Gorditz, Ooka, Jing Pow Ki Poo, Joey the Mechanical Boy, Hawkeye & Firebird, The Might Mun, Burglemir Frost Giant of the Supersphere, and Nakadai the Samurai. Music and Performance Monotrona shows and music are notoriously difficult to categorize but have been described as “a perfect balance between silliness and creepiness, not to mention … the best thing to happen to the sputtering corpse of electro since asymmetrical haircuts.” In a 1996 interview with local Portland ‘zine Snipehunt, Monotrona mused: “When you do stuff like this where you’re being kind of goofy anyway--if you don’t spread that goofiness, then you’ve failed.” She was even voted “Scariest Musical Performer” in Portland in 1996. This combination of fright and fun was perfectly captured
