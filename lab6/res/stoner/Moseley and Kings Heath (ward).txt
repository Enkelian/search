Moseley and Kings Heath (ward)
Moseley and Kings Heath is a ward within the constituency of Hall Green, covering the greater part of the Moseley and Kings Heath areas of Birmingham, England. Politics The Moseley and Kings Heath Ward Committee is part of the official structure of Birmingham City Council and exists to discuss issues which affect life within the ward, mostly (although not exclusively) related to the activity of the council. The Committee comprises the two elected Ward Councillors for the area together with the Member of Parliament for the Hall Green, Moseley and King's Heath, Sparkbrook, and Springfield constituency, Roger Godsiff, of which the ward is part.
