Fallin' Off the Edge
Fallin' Off the Edge is a compilation album by the American garage rock band the Seeds, and was released on GNP Crescendo, in 1977. The first album of its kind to compile Seeds music, Fallin' Off the Edge includes rarities of the group's catalogue, alternate takes, and unreleased tracks. Among the songs available include the 1968 version of the hit "Pushin' Too Hard" without studio-created crowd noises, which was originally the closing track to the fake live album Raw & Alive: The Seeds in Concert at Merlin's Music Box. Although other Seeds compilations have been released over the years, Fallin' Off the Edge remains a collector's item and has been reissued. Among the non-album songs from singles, include the opening track, "The Wind Blows Your Hair", which was originally released in 1967. Others that make an appearance are the B-side to the first release of "Can't Seem to Make You Mine", "Daisy Mae", "The Other Place", and "Fallin' Off the Edge of My Mind", which was the Seeds' last single for GNP Crescendo. Oddly enough, however, the final single's B-side, "Wild Blood", is not featured on the compilation. Previously unreleased recordings include "She's Gone", "Chocolate River", and an alternate version
