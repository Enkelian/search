Gold (Cream album)
Gold is a two-disc compilation album by the British rock band Cream, released in 2005 to help celebrate the band's reunion at the Royal Albert Hall. It was a part of the larger Gold series. The first disc consists of twenty-one studio tracks, with the second featuring eight live tracks. The tracks come from the band's four studio albums: Fresh Cream, Disraeli Gears, Wheels of Fire, and Goodbye, as well as Live Cream and Live Cream Volume II (which were released after the band's break up). Gold was also released under the name I Feel Free – Ultimate Cream, reaching No. 6 on the UK Albums Chart in May 2005. This version was available both as a two-disc release identical to Gold, and as a "limited edition box set" with Cream's 2003 BBC Sessions album included as a third disc.
