My Girls (Animal Collective song)
"My Girls" is a song by Animal Collective, released as the first single from their critically acclaimed 2009 album Merriweather Post Pavilion. It was released on March 23, 2009 by Domino Records as a promo CD only. During the tours of 2007 and 2008, the song was known as "House". Panda Bear explained to Clash that lyrically the song is about his "desire on a basic level to own my own place and kind of provide a safe house for my family and the people I care about." The song resembles a seminal piece of early house music, "Your Love" (1984), by Frankie Knuckles and Jamie Principle. The song's intro contains an audio sample from the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft, which explored Saturn's atmosphere and rings and gathered information about its moons; as part of its mission, the probe was destroyed in September 2017. Video A promotional music video was created, showing the three members who worked on the album performing the song with samplers, synthesizers and percussion instruments. The video was animated by Jon Vermilyea, whose illustrations were used in the artwork for the band's live compilation Animal Crack Box.
