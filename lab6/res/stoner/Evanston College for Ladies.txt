Evanston College for Ladies
The Evanston College for Ladies was a women's college in Evanston, Illinois between 1871 and 1873. Female students attended classes at Northwestern University, resided at the college, and attended supplemental courses such as fine arts, foreign language, and housekeeping. The mission of the Evanston College for Ladies was to give women access to Northwestern University similar to that which was granted to men. The college was merged with Northwestern University on June 25, 1873. Founding The Evanston College for Ladies had its inaugural class in the Fall of 1871, with 236 women enrolled as students. The new school aimed to provide women with the same advantages neighboring Northwestern University did to its male students, while also providing a home where the women's health, morals, and behavior would be attended to by female staff. It replaced the Northwestern Female College as the primary institution for the education of women in Evanston. The transition between the two colleges was smooth, and the charter was transferred to the Evanston College for Ladies at the final commencement for the previous school. Alumnae were accepted by the new college, and plans were made for the building that housed the Northwestern Female College to be rented
