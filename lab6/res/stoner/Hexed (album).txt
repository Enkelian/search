Hexed (album)
Hexed is the tenth and final studio album by Finnish melodic death metal band Children of Bodom. It was released on March 8, 2019. It is the only album to feature guitarist Daniel Freyberg since he became a member of the band in 2016, and also the second album (after Relentless Reckless Forever) not to have a song with "Bodom" in the title. Most of the songs are tuned in Drop B tuning and D-flat tuning, while the songs "This Road" and "Glass Houses" are tuned to D tuning. This is the band's first album since Follow the Reaper to include neo-classical elements. It is also the last album to feature longtime members Jaska Raatikainen, Henkka Seppälä, and Janne Wirman, who all quit the band in November 2019. It could also be the last to use the Children of Bodom name, as the departing members filed for the rights to the name, making it so frontman Alexi Laiho must be granted permission from all three to continue using the name.
