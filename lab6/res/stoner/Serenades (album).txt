Serenades (album)
Serenades is the full-length debut album by British doom metal band Anathema. It was released on February 28, 1993 through Peaceville Records. It is their only album to feature Darren White on lead vocals. Rhythm guitarist, Vincent Cavanagh, sang lead on all subsequent albums. Background Serenades expands on material from The Crestfallen EP, but features more experimentation and variation throughout. It was recorded between June and September 1992 at Yorkshire-based Academy Studios, the same place where The Crestfallen had been recorded one year prior. Track listing All lyrics written by Darren J. White, all music written by Danny Cavanagh.

It omits "Dreaming: The Romance", and in its place, adds a studio version of the demo song "All Faith is Lost" as well as the entirety of The Crestfallen EP. It also has a red-orange front cover instead of the original's yellow-orange front cover. This version was released by the Futurist subsidiary of MCA Records.
