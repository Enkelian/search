80-f
80-f is the third album released by UK band After the Fire. After the departure of drummer Ivor Twidell in October 1979, ATF recruited Nick Brotherwood as a replacement and started work on 80f in early 1980 with Tony Mansfield as producer. However, the resulting album was refused by CBS. As a result, ATF cancelled their planned tour and replaced Brotherwood with ex-Flys drummer Pete King. The band started re-recording the album with Queen and ELO producer, Mack. This time, the album was accepted by CBS and released on October 24, 1980.
