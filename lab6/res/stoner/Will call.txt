Will call
Will call refers to a method of delivery for purchased goods where the customer picks up the goods at the seller's place of business, primarily in North American commerce. It may also refer to the department within a business where goods are staged for customer pick up. An equivalent service for goods which are paid for in installments then retrieved once fully paid, which was common before credit cards became available, is called layaway, and is still used among those without access to credit cards. The word "call" is a shortened form of "call for", which means "to come and get", so "will call" literally means "(the customer) will call (come and get) the goods." In a linguistic process similar to initial-stress derived nominalization, the first syllable of the noun phrase is usually stressed (WILL call) rather than the second syllable in the verb phrase (will CALL).
