Background On the recording of the song, Giorgia said: “I sent her the song, performed by me in Italian, even though I didn’t really think she would get back to me. She took some time to try it out and months went by. Then, when we were almost done recording the album, she called. She had it translated and adapted to her, but she also wanted to sing some parts in Italian, which is even more surprising”.
