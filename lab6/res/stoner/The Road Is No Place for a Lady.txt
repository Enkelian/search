The Road Is No Place for a Lady
The Road Is No Place for a Lady is the fifth and final album released by Cass Elliot. It was the second album she recorded after signing with RCA Records. The album was recorded over a period of two months during the summer of 1972 at London's Trident Studios, produced by Lewis Merenstein and arranged and conducted by Larry Fallon and Del Newman. The album was essentially pop music but with several different styles woven in. It contained touches of swing music and even gospel. Two singles were released; the first, "(If You're Gonna) Break Another Heart", was written by Albert Hammond and released in August 1972. The song had little impact on the charts along with the second single, "Does Anybody Love You", released in November. Conception As with her previous album, Elliot was keen on exploring different musical avenues than what she had in the past. She chose Trident Studios along with British session musicians and studio engineers to help her achieve a "new" sound. As with her previous album, RCA granted her complete control over the material and allowed her to show her vision. The album was also credited to Cass Elliot and not "Mama Cass". Cover
