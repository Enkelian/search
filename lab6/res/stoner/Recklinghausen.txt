Recklinghausen (German pronunciation: [ˌʁɛklɪŋˈhaʊzn̩] (listen)) is the northernmost city in the Ruhr-Area and the capital of the Recklinghausen district.

Recklinghausen is the 60th-largest city in Germany and the 22nd-largest city in North Rhine-Westphalia. History First mentioned in 1017 as Ricoldinchuson, in 1150 the city was the center of the surrounding Vest Recklinghausen. In 1236, the city of Recklinghausen received town privileges. There is record of Jews in the city as early as 1305. As part of the County of Vest, ownership of Recklinghausen changed several times in the 15th and 16th century, and in 1576, the entire county was pawned to the Elector of Cologne. In 1582–83, again in 1586, and again in 1587, the city was plundered by partisan armies during the Cologne War, a feud over religious parity in Electorate of Cologne and electoral influence in the Holy Roman Empire.
