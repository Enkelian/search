Smiler (album)
Smiler is a 1974 album by Rod Stewart, his fifth solo, thirteenth overall since Truth with the Jeff Beck Group in 1968, and final album for Mercury Records. It was the first album by Rod Stewart to be critically panned. It reached number 1 in the UK album chart, and number 13 in the US. The album was largely considered to be an unadventurous retread of what he had done before, including covers of Chuck Berry, Sam Cooke and Bob Dylan songs, as well as a duet with Elton John of John's song "Let Me Be Your Car". Stewart's one attempt at adventurousness was a cover of Carole King's "(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman" where 'Woman' is switched to 'Man'. This track was selected for special derision by critics. [1] The release of the album itself was held up for five months due to legal problems between Mercury Records and Warner Bros. Records.[2] Musicians appearing on the album included members of Stewart's band Faces, as well as frequent collaborators Martin Quittenton (guitars), Pete Sears (bass & keyboards), and Mickey Waller (drums).
