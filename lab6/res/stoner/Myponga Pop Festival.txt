Myponga Pop Festival
The Myponga Pop Festival was a music festival which took place on a farm near Myponga, South Australia from 30 January to 1 February 1971. The main figure in the festival organising company, Music Power, was Hamish Henry, a young Adelaide millionaire entrepreneur who had a continuing involvement with rock music in the early '70s. As well as organising the Myponga festival, Henry managed one of the headlining local bands, War Machine and two other Adelaide groups, Headband and Fraternity. Its promoters were Music Power's Trevor Brine and Alex Innocenti. The festival was headlined by heavy metal pioneers, Black Sabbath. Cat Stevens was advertised as co-headline artist at the festival but he cancelled to perform in Los Angeles. The compere was Adrian Rawlins, who wrote of his experiences at Myponga, and other festivals, in his book Festivals in Australia: an Intimate History (1982). Another international act was Syrius, (from Hungary, see Jackie Orszaczky).Alex Innocenti tells a tale that perfectly illustrates Hamish Henry's desire to fund the venture at any cost: "We went down to the farm at Myponga in Hamish's great American sports car with no roof, like movie stars," he recalls. "The farmer says, `What do you guys want?'
