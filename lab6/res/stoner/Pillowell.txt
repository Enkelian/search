Pillowell
Pillowell is a small English village in Gloucestershire, on the south-eastern edge of the Forest of Dean. Description Pillowell's coordinates are 51.75° N 02.55° W. It was established as a mining village, directly east of Whitecroft and directly the west of Yorkley. Its current population is about 250, with a housing stock of 101. There is a late 19th-century Methodist chapel. Much of the village lies within a conservation area.Pillowell Community Primary School, founded in the 19th century, briefly became nationally known in 1973, when the children, under their music teacher Mrs Davies, sang "I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles" as the signature tune for Winifred Foley's A Child of the Forest, when it was serialized on BBC Woman's Hour. The poet F. W. Harvey (1888–1957) spent the last part of his life in the village. History According to the conservation area documentation, the earliest inhabitants may have been squatters on the edge of the royal Forest of Dean. In 1787, when the area still belonged to Newland parish, there were ten dwellings on Crown land, near the well that gave the settlement its name. Stronger growth came in the mid-19th century, with the development of deep mining. A Primitive Methodist chapel
