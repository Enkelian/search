Kingdom of Sorrow
Kingdom of Sorrow, is an American heavy metal band which features Kirk Windstein of Crowbar and Down, along with Jamey Jasta of Hatebreed. History Kingdom of Sorrow was founded when the Hatebreed front man Jamey Jasta introduced himself to Down/Crowbar guitarist Kirk Windstein at a show at Pearl Street in Northampton, Massachusetts. A short time later Jasta, who actively booked shows throughout New England in the early nineties, put up the cash for a Napalm Death/Crowbar show in order that Hatebreed could play with one of his favorite bands. Ever since, the two have remained in close contact and became friends over the subsequent decade. Jasta and Hatebreed invited Crowbar out for a UK run of dates in March 2005. It was there that the two friends decided to create a band based on their mutual affinity for bands of the likes of Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, and Pantera. In May 2005, the duo recorded in Silver Bullet Studios in Connecticut, and Kirk relocated after hurricane Katrina to write and assemble what would become the first Kingdom of Sorrow album. The first taste of the untitled project surfaced in the form of the track "Buried in Black" on Roadrunner Records'
