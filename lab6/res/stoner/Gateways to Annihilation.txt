Gateways to Annihilation
Gateways to Annihilation is the sixth studio album by the death metal band Morbid Angel. This album saw a change in musical style as the speed-laden intensity of the previous album Formulas Fatal to the Flesh was abandoned for a slower, more droning style, reminiscent of Blessed Are the Sick. This is also the first album in which Steve Tucker contributed lyrics and music to the band. Dan Seagrave painted the album cover. This marks the first Morbid Angel album cover he had painted since Altars of Madness. The intro track name "Kawazu" is an archaic Japanese word meaning "frog", which explains the sounds of frogs croaking on the track. Track listing All lyrics are written by Steve Tucker, except "Secured Limitations" by Trey Azagthoth. Personnel Steve Tucker – bass, lead vocals Trey Azagthoth – guitars, backing vocals Erik Rutan – guitars, keyboards Pete Sandoval – drums == References ==
