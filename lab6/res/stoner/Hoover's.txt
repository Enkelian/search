Hoover's
D&B Hoovers was founded by Gary Hoover and Patrick Spain in 1990 as an American business research company that provides information on companies and industries through their primary product platform named "Hoover's". In 2003, it was acquired by Dun & Bradstreet and operated for a time as a wholly owned subsidiary. In 2017, the Hoover's product was re-branded D&B Hoovers. Origins and expansion Hoover's was started in 1990 by Gary Hoover, Patrick J. Spain, Alan Chai and Alta Campbell. Earlier, Hoover had founded the Bookstop book store chain and then sold it to Barnes & Noble. Hoover's initially was called The Reference Press and published reference books about companies. (Books for libraries and related markets are still published, but book publishing is a small part of Dun & Bradstreet's sales.)The company grew rapidly under a business team led by Spain that included Carl Shepherd, Lynn Atchison, Elisabeth DeMarse, Jani Spede, Kris Rao and Gordon Anderson, among others. Spain was CEO from 1993 to 2001 and chairman from 1994 to 2002. Hoover's made an initial public offering on the NASDAQ exchange in 1999. The company then became a subsidiary of Dun & Bradstreet, which bought Hoover's for $119 million in 2003.
