John Storyk (born May 10, 1946), a registered architect and acoustician, is a founding partner (with wife and business partner Beth Walters) of Walters-Storyk Design Group. Soon to celebrate his 50th anniversary as an innovative recording studio designer, he began his career in 1968 with Electric Lady Studios for Jimi Hendrix in New York City. That studio continues to serve as a prolific catalyst for Gold & Platinum hits for stars ranging from Adele to Daft Punk and Ed Sheeran. Storyk and his WSDG associates have provided design, system integration, and construction supervision services for almost 4000 professional audio recording and video production/post-production studios, performance venues, sports, houses of worship and educational facilities. WSDG is an eleven-time winner of the prestigious TEC Award for outstanding achievement in Acoustics/Facility Design. Including, most recently, three consecutive wins: the 30th Annual (2015) for the Berklee College of Music, 160 Massachusetts Avenue, Boston, MA.; The 31st Annual (2016) The Church Studios London for multi-Grammy & Academy Award-winning producer Paul Epworth; and the 32nd Annual (2017) Boston Symphony Orchestra Control Room. To date thirty WSDG studio design projects (including four multiple-entry nominations), have competed for TEC Awards since the event debuted in 1985. Beijingâ€™s 55TEC
