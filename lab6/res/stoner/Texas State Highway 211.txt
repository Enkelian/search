State Highway 211 or SH 211 (Hill Country Parkway) is a 11.184-mile (17.999 km) state highway west of the city of San Antonio in the U.S. state of Texas. This route was designated in 1986 as an access route to the Texas Research Park.

The completed sections of the route consist of a southern section from U.S. Highway 90 (US 90) north to Farm to Market Road 1957 (FM 1957) and a northern section from FM 471 north to SH 16. The Texas Transportation Commission has approved a pass-through toll agreement that Bexar County submitted in October 2008.

The completion of the section between FM 1957 (Potranco Road) to FM 471 (Culebra Road) will finally allow for seamless travel from Hwy 90 at the south end, north to SH 16 (Bandera Road). The improvements to FM 1957 (Potranco Road) will allow for the
