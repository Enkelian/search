Inter-Empire Championships
The Festival of Empire or Festival of the Empire was held at The Crystal Palace in London in 1911, to celebrate the coronation of King George V. It opened on 12 May. Exhibition Exhibitions of products from the countries of the Empire were displayed in three-quarter size models of their Parliamentary buildings erected in the grounds: Australia – based on Parliament House, Melbourne c. 1855 Canada – based on Centre Block with Victoria Tower, 1866 Newfoundland – based on Colonial Building, c. 1850 New Zealand – based on New Zealand Parliament Buildings, pre-1907 South Africa – based on Houses of Parliament, Cape Town c.1884The buildings were constructed of timber and plaster as they were meant to be temporary. They were linked by an electric tramway called the 'All-Red Route' on which open-sided cars took the visitor on a circular tour of the Dominions with typical scenery of each country around the buildings listed above. Bridges over small lakes represented sea voyages between the countries. The route is shown in red on the map and some of the cars may be seen in the picture above. There were also many other exhibits within the Palace itself. Pageant of London A pageant,
