Shot in the Dark (Great White album)
Shot in the Dark is the second studio album by the American hard rock band Great White, released in 1986. It was originally released by Telegraph Records and distributed by Greenworld Entertainment. Later that same year it was picked up and re-issued by Capitol Records. The original issue featured a different intro to "She Shakes Me" (which was titled "Shake Me"), a different recording entirely of the song "Run Away", and a different mix of the several tracks. Great White's music in this album shows the transition from the pure heavy metal of the first album to a more blues-influenced style of hard rock, paying homage to the great rock bands of the 1970s, like Led Zeppelin and AC/DC. The first album to feature drummer Audie Desbrow. The album features one of the band's first well-known hits, a cover of The Angels song "Face the Day." The re-mastered CD release was on the Razor & Tie label and was remastered by Steve Hoffman.
