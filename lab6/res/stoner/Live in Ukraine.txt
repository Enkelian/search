Live in Ukraine
Live in Ukraine is a double live album and video and also last release by British rock collaboration Queen + Paul Rodgers. It was recorded in September 2008 during the Rock the Cosmos Tour at Freedom Square in Kharkiv, Ukraine and was released on 15 June 2009. A companion DVD was also released. History Just weeks ahead of the start of the Rock the Cosmos Tour the band were approached to help Ukraine’s Olena Pinchuk AntiAids Foundation reach out to the youth of the country with this message: ‘Don’t Let AIDS Ruin Your Life”. The venue they played was Kharkiv’s historic Freedom Square, a place so big that during World War II it was used to land planes. For the band and crew it meant “Everyone had to run very fast, very suddenly, but then most of the great and worthwhile things in your life are a little dangerous.” Over 350,000 Ukrainians came to see them play and more than 10,000,000 (by conservative estimates) homes watched the show live on television. In all, more than 20,000,000 took part in what the band recall as “an unforgettable experience… one of those rare things in life you know you will never forget.
