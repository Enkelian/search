Public Ivy
"Public Ivy" is a term coined by Richard Moll in his 1985 book Public Ivies: A Guide to America's Best Public Undergraduate Colleges and Universities to refer to U.S. universities that are said to provide an Ivy League collegiate experience at a public university price. Public Ivies, according to The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education, are capable of "successfully competing with the Ivy League schools in academic rigor ... attracting superstar faculty and in competing for the best and brightest students of all races." Origins of the term Moll, who earned his Master of Divinity degree from Yale University in 1959, was an admissions officer at Yale and the director of admissions at Bowdoin College, University of California, Santa Cruz, and Vassar College. He traveled the nation examining higher education and identified eight public institutions (the same as the number of Ivy League members) that he thought had the look and feel of an Ivy League university. In addition to academic excellence, other factors considered by Moll include appearance, age, and school traditions.
