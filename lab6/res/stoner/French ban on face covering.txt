French ban on face covering
France became the first European country to impose a ban on full-face veils in public areas.Public debate exacerbated concerns over immigration, nationalism, secularism, security, and sexuality. Arguments supporting this proposal include that face-coverings prevent the clear identification of a person (which is both a security risk, and a social hindrance within a society which relies on facial recognition and expression in communication), that the alleged forcing of women to cover their faces is sexist, and that Muslims who continue this practice should be forced to assimilate into traditional French social norms. Argument against include that the ban encroaches on individual freedoms, and that it discriminates against interpretations of Islam that require or encourage women to wear face coverings, that it takes away the choice of women to decide whether to dress according to a particular standard of modesty, and prevents anonymity in situations where it might be socially or personally desirable. Opponents accused President Nicolas Sarkozy of fostering Islamophobia and using the law for political gain.As of 11 April 2011, it is illegal to wear a face-covering veil or other masks in public spaces. Veils, scarves and other headwear that do not cover the face are unaffected by this law.
