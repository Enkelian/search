Covered, A Revolution in Sound
Covered, A Revolution in Sound is a tribute album produced and released by Warner Bros. Records to commemorate its 50th anniversary as a record label. The album consists of some of the greatest hits from previous and current artists from the late 20th century, while the songs featured on the album themselves are performed by current artists that are signed to Warner Bros. Records. Warner's sister label Elektra Records had done something similar to this nearly 20 years before with an album titled Rubáiyát: Elektra's 40th Anniversary, which featured then-current Elektra artists covering other songs originally released on Elektra or sister label Asylum Records.
