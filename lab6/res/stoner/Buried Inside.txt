Buried Inside
Buried Inside was a Canadian band from Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. History Buried Inside was formed in 1997, influenced by early metalcore and hardcore punk bands Acme, One Eyed God Prophecy, Drift, and Union of Uranus. Their sound included distorted vocals, creatively timed drumming, heavy use of octave double stops (which created a melodic effect), and occasional sampling of gloomy film dialogue or instruments such as the cello. After releasing two independent albums, in 2005 they signed to Relapse Records and put out their "concept" album, Chronoclast. That year the band toured North America with Eye-HateGod and Byzantine.In 2009 they released their fourth album, Spoils of Failure. They played their final show on November 13, 2010.
