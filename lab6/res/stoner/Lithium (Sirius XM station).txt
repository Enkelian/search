Lithium (Sirius XM station)
Lithium is a 1990s grunge and alternative rock channel airing on Sirius XM Radio channel 34 and Dish Network channel 6034. It debuted on Sirius Satellite Radio on February 14, 2007, moving SIRIUS Disorder to channel 32 and later to channel 70. An update was sent to all Sirius radios which corrected the issue where Lithium was called "'90s Alternative" and the Stiletto radios displayed the Sirius logo. The Sirius radios and website displays the channel as "Lithium." It takes its name from the Nirvana song, "Lithium". Lithium was the first all-1990s channel since I-90 signed off on November 4, 2002. While the primary focus is grunge and alternative rock, the channel also played bands from the late 1990s wave of nu metal and alternative metal, such as Korn, Limp Bizkit, Orgy, Slipknot and Tool. Merger with Lucy On November 12, 2008, during the Sirius/XM channel merger, the XM channel Lucy was renamed as Lithium. Whereas the old Lithium didn't feature adult album alternative bands such as The Cranberries or Crash Test Dummies, Lucy featured those artists. The Lucy playlist dropped all the 2000s music already played on its sister Alt Nation channel, and Lucy took on the Lithium name.
