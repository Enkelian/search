Jason Thornberry
Writer and reporter, Jason Thornberry was once very actively involved in music, playing the drums in a number of punk alternative rock bands in Southern California. His tenure with the band Mulch saw them perform 200 times in two years, a feat for an unsigned band. Mulch performed with everyone from No Doubt to NOFX in the early 1990s. Thornberry founded [The Pressure]], who went from complete obscurity to the cover of The OC Weekly less than a year after their first concert. In 1999, The Pressure was readying the release of their debut album Things Move Fast, when Thornberry was discovered in a coma after being beaten nearly to death. Four months later Jason was released in a wheelchair. Within a year he was walking again, and he'd begun to document the experience. Jason would continue to see therapists for a long time, having also temporarily lost the ability to speak or to use the left side of his body after the assault.He returned to school and edited his college newspaper, The Coast Report, along with contributions to The OC Weekly, URB, Mean Street, and more than two dozen print and online music magazines around the world.Jason lives in
