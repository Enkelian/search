Bismuth chloride
Bismuth chloride (or butter of bismuth) is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula BiCl3. It is a covalent compound and is the common source of the Bi3+ ion. In the gas phase and in the crystal, the species adopts a pyramidal structure, in accord with VSEPR theory. Preparation Bismuth chloride can be synthesized directly by passing chlorine over bismuth. 2 Bi + 3 Cl2 → 2 BiCl3or by dissolving bismuth metal in aqua regia, evaporating the mixture to give BiCl3·2H2O, which can be distilled to form the anhydrous trichloride.Alternatively, it may be prepared by adding hydrochloric acid to bismuth oxide and evaporating the solution. Bi2O3 + 6 HCl → 2 BiCl3 + 3 H2OAlso, the compound can be prepared by dissolving bismuth in concentrated nitric acid and then adding solid sodium chloride into this solution. Bi + 6 HNO3 → Bi(NO3)3 + 3 H2O + 3 NO2 Bi(NO3)3 + 3 NaCl → BiCl3 + 3 NaNO3 Structure In the gas phase BiCl3 is pyramidal with a Cl-Bi-Cl angle of 97.5° and a bond length of 242 pm. In the solid state, each Bi atom has three near neighbors at 250 pm, two at 324 pm and three at a
