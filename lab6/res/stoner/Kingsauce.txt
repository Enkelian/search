Kingsauce
Kingsauce is a "novelty-pop" project headed by Richie Chodes. They are considered to be an extension of The Elephant 6 Recording Company. Combining elements of mid-1960s pop, 1970s AM radio, and a touch of vaudeville, Kingsauce creates tunes with silly, tongue-in-cheek lyrics. Their last full-length CD Cancelled was released in August 2007. Chodes was also a member of Vince Mole and his Calcium Orchestra, headed by former Apples in Stereo guitarist Chris Parfitt.
