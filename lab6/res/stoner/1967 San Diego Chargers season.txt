1967 San Diego Chargers season
The 1967 Season was the 8th season for the San Diego Chargers as a professional AFL franchise; the team improved on their 7–6–1 record in 1966 and fishing at 8–5–1. It was the team's first season at San Diego Stadium (now known as Qualcomm Stadium), and the Chargers finished in third place in the AFL West Division with a record of 8–5–1. In August 1967, the San Diego Chargers played their first game at the new football stadium. The city named it the San Diego Stadium. In 1980, the city officially changed it to Jack Murphy Stadium. The city revamped the stadium in 1984 and added 11,000 seats and fancy booths at a cost of 9.1 million dollars. But this was still not enough for the city and in 1997 another 11,500 seats were added along with more suites and a club level. This was the same year that the city sold the stadium's naming rights to a San Diego company for $18 million and the name officially changed to Qualcomm Stadium.
