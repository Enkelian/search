It is an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark.

The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors migrated from Alaska through Northern Canada, gradually settling across the island by the 13th century.Nowadays, the population is largely concentrated on the southwest coast, while the rest of the island is sparsely populated.

It has two unincorporated areas — the Northeast Greenland National Park and the Thule Air Base. The last one, even if under Danish control, is administered by the United States Air Force.
