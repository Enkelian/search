Jazz Tour
The Jazz Tour was a concert tour by the British rock band Queen, supporting the album Jazz. The tour was memorable for the spectacle created by the band. As James Henke of Rolling Stone said about the band's Halloween 1978 concert in New Orleans: "...when they were launching a U.S. tour in support of their Jazz, album, Queen threw a bash in New Orleans that featured snake charmers, strippers, crossdressers and a naked fat lady who smoked cigarettes in her crotch." Part of the European leg was recorded for the band's first live album, Live Killers. Due to the tour starting within the same month as the final recording sessions for Jazz, Freddie Mercury's voice is worn out from the start, and his performances are generally sub-par when compared to the previous tour. When "We Will Rock You" was performed, there would be a person dressed in a Superman costume holding up Freddie Mercury while he sings.
