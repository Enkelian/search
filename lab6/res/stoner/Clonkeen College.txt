Clonkeen College is a Christian Brothers secondary school for boys in south Dublin, which opened in 1970. Clonkeen College has approximately 550 students and 35 teaching staff. Edward Melly is the principal and Michael Brennan is the Deputy Principal. The school has strong links with charities and the developing world. Clonkeen underwent significant development between the years 2015 – 2018. History The Ordnance Survey Ireland map 1837–1842 shows Clonkeen School Ho[use], located in the present day Cornelscourt Village. Although the same building appears on the OSI 1888–1913 map, it is not named as a school any more. The original junior school was St. Joseph's Private Preparatory School, built in September 1965 close to where the present Clonkeen College stands. It was run by a staff of three Christian Brothers until the school was closed in 1975. The secondary school was also called St. Joseph's, until renamed Clonkeen College. The present school stands on the site of Charles Stewart Parnell’s second last public meeting. The first pupils to the current school were admitted in the autumn of 1970, there was one fifth year and two third year classes (there was no fourth year then). Thirteen students completed the first Leaving Certificate.
