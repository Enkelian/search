Single Top 100
The Dutch Single Top 100 is a Dutch chart, based on official physical single sales, legal downloads and since July 2013 streaming and composed by Dutch Charts. It is one of the three official charts, the other two being the Dutch Top 40 and the Mega Top 50. The difference is that these charts also include airplay data. The list is especially intended for the music industry and those who take an interest in charts. In Dutch TV programmes the Single Top 100 is often cited, although it has not been broadcast since December 2006. History The predecessor of the Single Top 100 started on 23 May 1969 as the Hilversum 3 Top 30. Originally it was broadcast by the VPRO and ever since December 1970 by the NOS. It was presented by Willem van Kooten. In 1971 Felix Meurders hosted the radio show. He renamed it the Daverende Dertig. In June 1974 the Nationale Hitparade became the official chart of Hilversum 3. It was a top 30 until the number of entries was extended to 50 in June 1978. The TROS took over the programme in 1985. AVRO's popular music chart television programme TopPop used the chart from 1974
