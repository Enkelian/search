Logos (Atlas Sound album)
Logos is the second studio album from ambient experimental project Atlas Sound. It was released on October 19, 2009, in Europe by 4AD, and on October 20 in the US by Kranky. The album features guest contributions from Noah Lennox (a.k.a. Panda Bear of Animal Collective) and Stereolab's LÃ¦titia Sadier. Units ordered directly from Rough Trade came packaged with a bonus six-song EP of leftover material. The album reached #7 on the Billboard Heatseekers album chart. The cover art is an image of Bradford Cox, who has Marfan syndrome, and is inspired by the artwork of his previous release. Background An unmastered and unfinished version of Logos was accidentally leaked in 2008 by frontman Bradford Cox via his own Mediafire account. The incident caused an outrage from Cox, who posted on his blog that he felt what was leaked was simply a "sketch" of what he intended to be the final product, and was not meant to be released publicly. He almost abandoned the project, but continued to work on the album shortly after the incident. A leak of the finalized version of the album surfaced on September 1, 2009. The album's first single "Walkabout" was made available for streaming
