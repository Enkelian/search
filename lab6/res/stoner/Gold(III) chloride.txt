Gold(III) chloride
Gold(III) chloride, traditionally called auric chloride, is a chemical compound of gold and chlorine. With the molecular formula Au2Cl6, the name gold trichloride is a simplification, referring to the empirical formula, AuCl3. The Roman numerals in the name indicate that the gold has an oxidation state of +3, which is common for gold compounds. There is also another related chloride of gold, gold(I) chloride (AuCl). Chloroauric acid, HAuCl4, the product formed when gold dissolves in aqua regia, is sometimes referred to as "gold chloride" or "acid gold trichloride". Gold(III) chloride is very hygroscopic and highly soluble in water as well as ethanol. It decomposes above 160 °C or in light. Structure AuCl3 exists as a chloride-bridged dimer both as a solid and as a vapour, at least at low temperatures. Gold(III) bromide behaves analogously. The structure is similar to that of iodine(III) chloride. In gold(III) chloride, each gold center is square planar, which is typical of a metal complex with a d8 electron count. The bonding in AuCl3 is considered somewhat covalent. Preparation Gold(III) chloride is most often prepared by passing chlorine gas over gold powder at 180 °C: 2 Au + 3 Cl2 → Au2Cl6Another method of preparation is
