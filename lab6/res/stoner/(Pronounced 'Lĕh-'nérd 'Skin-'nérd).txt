Several of the album's songs remain among the band's most well-known: "Gimme Three Steps", "Simple Man", "Tuesday's Gone" and "Free Bird", the last of which launched the band to national stardom. The album was certified gold on December 18, 1974, and double platinum on July 21, 1987, by the RIAA. The album also peaked at 27 in the Billboard 200 in 1975. Overview Most of the songs on the album had been in the band's live repertoire for some time. The band found a rural rehearsal space near Jacksonville which they nicknamed "Hell House" due to the long hours spent there jamming in the intense Florida heat, and it was there that they composed and ran through the songs endlessly until they were perfected. Producer Al Kooper marveled at how well prepared the band were once they entered the studio; every note was immutable and absolutely no improvisation was allowed.Bassist Leon Wilkeson left the band a few months before the album's recording sessions. Ex-Strawberry Alarm Clock guitarist Ed King had been extremely impressed with the band after an earlier incarnation of Skynyrd
