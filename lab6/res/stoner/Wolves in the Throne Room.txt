Wolves in the Throne Room
Wolves in the Throne Room is an American black metal band formed in 2003 in Olympia, Washington by brothers Aaron and Nathan Weaver. They have released six full-length albums, two live albums, and one EP to date. They have stated one of the founding concepts of the band to be channeling the "energies of the Pacific Northwest's landscape" into musical form. History Formation and Diadem of 12 Stars (2003â€“2006) Brothers Aaron and Nathan Weaver formed the band in 2003. Their first practice took place in a falling-down cabin located on the then-abandoned and overgrown Calliope Farm, which they had recently moved to. Nathan met Nick Paul at a local party and the three began to write material for their first demo. At the time, Nick was heavily influenced by Thrash, Speed, and Death Metal, citing bands like Death and Bolt Thrower, as well as Post-Punk and Gothic Rock influences such as Swans, Siouxsie and the Banshees, and Fields of the Nephilim. Aaron and Nathan's musical style was more informed by Crust, Doom, Norwegian Black Metal and American Black Metal. The band's first release was their 2004 demo, a black CD-R wrapped in fur with moss inside the lyric sheet. Nick
