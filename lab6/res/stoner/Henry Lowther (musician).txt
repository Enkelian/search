Thomas Henry Lowther (born 11 July 1941, Leicester, Leicestershire) is an English jazz trumpeter. Lowther's first experience was on cornet in a Salvation Army band.

Many of these associations continued into the 1970s. Lowther appeared for some time with the Keef Hartley Band during this period. In the 1970s he worked with Mike Gibbs (1970–76), Kenny Wheeler (from 1972), Alan Cohen (1972), Michael Garrick (1972–73), Kurt Edelhagen (1974), John Taylor (1974), Stan Tracey (1976 onwards), Tony Coe (1976), Graham Collier (1976–78), Jubiaba with Barbara Thompson (1978) and Gordon Beck (1978), in addition to his own ensemble, Quaternity. Lowther played the trumpet solo for Elton John on "Return to Paradise" for John's 1978 album A Single Man. He worked with Buzzcocks in 1980, Talk Talk from 1983 to 1991, with Peter King from 1983, and with Gil Evans in 1984.
