Trouble (Whitesnake album)
Trouble is the first studio album from British hard rock band Whitesnake, led by former Deep Purple vocalist David Coverdale. It reached No. 50 on the UK Albums Chart when it was released in October 1978. This followed the 4 track EP Snakebite, later available in the US as an import album from continental Europe. This is also the first Whitesnake album to feature Coverdale's former bandmate in Deep Purple, Jon Lord. Recording The album was recorded at Central Recorders Studio in London during the summer of 1978. Martin Birch produced the album, which was recorded and mixed in ten days. According to Coverdale, one of the reasons the album was called "Trouble", was that his first child was born during the album's recording.
