Centenary's main campus is located in Hackettstown. History Centenary was founded as the Centenary Collegiate Institute by the Newark Methodist Episcopal Church in 1867. It was built at a cost of $200,000. George H. Whitney, D.D., was president from 1869 to 1895. In 1886, a 19 year old kitchen worker named Tillie Smith was "outraged" and murdered in a field just off campus. A janitor named James Titus was convicted of the crime based on circumstantial evidence strongly influenced by yellow journalism. Authors and historians generally consider this to be a false conviction but debate over the facts continue perennially through dark tourism ghost tours, theatrical performances, books and Weird NJ
