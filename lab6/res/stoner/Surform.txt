Surform
A surform tool (also surface-forming tool) features perforated sheet metal and resembles a food grater. A surform tool consists of a steel strip with holes punched out and the rim of each hole sharpened to form a cutting edge. The strip is mounted in a carriage or handle. Surform tools were called "cheese graters" decades before they entered the market as kitchen utensils used to grate cheese. Surform planes have been described as a cross between a rasp and a plane.Although similar to many food graters made of perforated sheet metal, surforms differ in having sharpened rims. Also, a surform typically is used to shape material, rather than grate it. Etymology and history The word surform is an apparent portmanteau of "surface" and "form". It is unclear whether this is a genericized trademark or the opposite, a common name that was subsequently trademarked.

Surform was first registered as a trade mark in the United Kingdom on 25 September 1953The first Surform tools were the invention of a British company.
