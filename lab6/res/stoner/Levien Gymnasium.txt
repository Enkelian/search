Levien Gymnasium
Francis S. Levien Gymnasium is a 2,500-seat arena at Columbia University in New York City. Named for New York lawyer-industrialist Francis S. Levien (1905â€“95), it is home to the Columbia Men's and Women's Basketball teams and the Women's Volleyball team. It is also used for gym classes in between games. Part of the Marcellus Hartley Dodge Physical Fitness Center, Levien Gym opened in 1974 as a replacement for the old University Gym, which is still used for intramural sports.
