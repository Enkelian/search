Skeletal Lamping
Skeletal Lamping is the ninth studio album by Athens, Georgia-based band of Montreal. Kevin Barnes said about the title: "This record is my attempt to bring all of my puzzling, contradicting, disturbing, humorous... fantasies, ruminations and observations to the surface, so that I can better dissect and understand their reason for being in my head. Hence the title, Skeletal Lamping."Lamping is the name of a hunting technique of using a powerful beam to dazzle animals to the extent that they can be approached closely and collected, inspected or shot. Style As with most of Montreal albums, Kevin Barnes performed almost all the instrumental and vocal tracks himself.In an interview with Wireless Bollinger in 2007, Barnes described his concept for the follow-up to Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer? as an album composed of hundreds of consecutive short segments ranging from thirty to fifty seconds in length, with the intention that it "feel like one long piece with hundreds of movements." In an interview with Pitchfork Media, Barnes stated that of Montreal would continue to evolve with Skeletal Lamping: "Musically, it is sort of all over the place, too. There really isn't necessarily a sense of continuity there. It's definitely funkier.
