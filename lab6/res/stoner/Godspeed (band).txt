Godspeed (band)
Godspeed is an American metal band formed in 1992. Following the release of their debut album Ride on Atlantic Records, produced by Rachel Bolan of Skid Row, the band embarked on two high-profile tours as the opening act for Black Sabbath and Dio. Godspeed gained attention with an appearance on the 1994 Black Sabbath tribute album Nativity in Black, on which they teamed up with guest vocalist Bruce Dickinson of Iron Maiden to record a cover of the Black Sabbath song, "Sabbath Bloody Sabbath." After the band's late nineties breakup, bassist Chris Kosnik and guitarist Tommy Southard went on to heavily contribute to the stoner rock movement with their own bands The Atomic Bitchwax and Solace for nearly two decades. Godspeed's original line-up reunited in 2012 to record new material and a tour in mid-2013.
