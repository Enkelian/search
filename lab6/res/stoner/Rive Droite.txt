Rive Droite
La Rive Droite (French pronunciation: ​[la ʁiv dʁwat], The Right Bank) is most commonly associated with the river Seine in central Paris. Here the river flows roughly westwards, cutting the city into two: when facing downstream, the northern bank is to the right, and the southern bank (or Rive Gauche) is to the left.Owing to its association with places such as Place Vendôme, the Right Bank can now be used to refer to a level of elegance and sophistication not found in the more bohemian Left Bank. The Right Bank's most famous street is the Champs-Élysées, but there are others of prominence, such as Rue de la Paix, Rue de Rivoli and Avenue Montaigne.
