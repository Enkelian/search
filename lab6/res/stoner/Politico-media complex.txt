Politico-media complex
The politico-media complex (PMC, also referred to as the political-media complex) is a name that has been given to the close, systematized, symbiotic-like network of relationships between a state's political and ruling classes and its media industry. It may also encompass other interest groups, such as law (and its enforcement through the police), corporations and multinationals. The term PMC is used as a pejorative, to refer to the collusion between governments, individual politicians, and the media industry, in their attempt to manipulate rather than inform the general public.The idea that the media has profound impacts on the polity of the nation state, democratic or otherwise, is not a new one, and hardly controversial. Election campaigns spend significant sums in the media, and oppressive regimes nearly always seek to control the media. It is a very powerful means of persuasion. Prior to Chomsky's propaganda model, George Orwell noted: "All the papers that matter live off their advertisements and the advertisers exercise an indirect censorship over the news." This observation is at the heart of two of the filters that structure the propaganda model: advertising (of corporations) as the primary source of income for the mass media and the dependence upon information
