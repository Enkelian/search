Loreto College, Foxrock
Loreto College, Foxrock is a voluntary fee-paying Catholic secondary school under the direction of the Sisters of Loreto in Foxrock, a suburb of Dublin, Ireland. It is situated on the N11 in Dublin. History The school was opened in 1941. The Bishop asked Mother Pauline Dunne, Superior General of Loreto, to open a junior and secondary school in Foxrock. The Sisters arrived in the house on September 8, 1941. "School began two days later. The pupil numbers were in single digits for the first few weeks, but had grown to 28 by the following spring."Work on the construction of the chapel (now the staff room) began in January 1942. The early years were impacted by World War II, and conditions were difficult. When the architect for the chapel sought the iron girders needed for the construction, it was found that none could be sourced. He solved the problem by supporting the roof by two rows of pillars, which were considered to add to the dignity of the building.In September 1942, the school was officially recognised as a secondary school by the Department of Education. The kindergarten / junior school block was completed and occupied by Christmas 1942, and by May
