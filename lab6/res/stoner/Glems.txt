Glems
The river Glems is a right tributary of the river Enz in Baden-Württemberg, Germany and around 47 km (29 mi) long. The spring is located in the south-west of Stuttgart. On the way to the confluence into the Enz next to Unterriexingen (a quarter of Markgröningen) it passes the districts of Böblingen and Ludwigsburg. The river Glems gives its name to a wooded mountain range called Glemswald in the Böblingen district of Stuttgart Region. == References ==
