Guitar picking
Guitar picking is a group of hand and finger techniques a guitarist uses to set guitar strings in motion to produce audible notes. These techniques involve plucking, strumming, brushing, etc. Picking can be done with: A pick (plectrum) held in the hand Natural or artificial fingernails, fingertips or finger-mounted plectrums known as fingerpicks (for techniques collectively known as fingerstyle) A plectrum held between thumb and one finger, supplemented by the free fingers—called hybrid picking or sometimes "chicken pickin".Using a single thumb pick with the bare fingers is similar to hybrid picking. Another mixed technique is to play different passages with a plectrum or fingerstyle, "palming" the plectrum when not in use. This however requires the use of one or more picking hand fingers, and/or can reduce dexterity in the picking hand. Comparison of plectrum and finger picking techniques The pros of each guitar picking style are indirectly correlated to the cons of the other. Fingerpicking advantages A pick isn’t necessary. It is easier to play non-adjacent strings at the same time, or immediately consecutively. It is easier to play polyphonically, with separate musical lines, or separate melody, harmony and bass. It is sometimes easier to play arpeggios in certain styles
