Human chain (politics)
A human chain is a form of demonstration in which people link their arms as a show of political solidarity. The chains can involve thousands of people, with the world record being claimed in 2020 by Bihar, India, which was estimated to include 43 million people across 18,000 kilometres (11,000 mi)to support his government's efforts towards environment conservation and eradication of social evils.
