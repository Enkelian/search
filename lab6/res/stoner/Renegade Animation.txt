Renegade Animation
Renegade Animation is an American animation studio located in Glendale, California which currently specializes in Macromedia Flash/Toon Boom animation. It was founded by Disney and Warner Bros. animator and director Darrell Van Citters and his business partner Ashley Postelwaite in July 1992 in Burbank, California. Renegade previously produced Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi for Cartoon Network and The Mr. Men Show for Chorion, and is currently working on The Tom and Jerry Show and Unikitty! for Warner Bros. Animation. History Renegade Animation initially produced several commercials and animated short films, beginning with the second "Hare Jordan" spot for Nike, which featured Bugs Bunny as his own alter-ego and Michael Jordan as Air Jordan, as well as numerous spots for Cheetos and Kellogg's, among others. In the mid-'90s, they moved into internet cartoons, and produced Will Ryan's "Elmo Aardvark: Outer Space Detective". They have since branched out into television, and are perhaps most well known as the producers of cartoon series Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi, The Mr. Men Show and The Tom and Jerry Show, a series featuring Tom and Jerry. They also co-produced the live-action/Traditionally-animated telefilm Re-Animated with Appleday Pictures. Renegade also produced the 2007 direct-to-video Christmas film Christmas Is Here
