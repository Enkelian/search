Controller (computing)
In computing and especially in computer hardware, a controller is a chip (such as a microcontroller), an expansion card, or a stand-alone device that interfaces with a more peripheral device. This may be a link between two parts of a computer (for example a memory controller that manages access to memory for the computer) or a controller on an external device that manages the operation of (and connection with) that device. The term is sometimes used in the opposite sense to refer to a device by which the user controls the operation of the computer, as in game controller. In desktop computers the controller may be a plug-in board, a single integrated circuit on the motherboard, or an external device. In mainframes the controller is usually either a separate device attached to a channel or integrated into the peripheral. Host and peripheral controllers Controllers can be present on both sides of a computer bus. The controller on the host side (physically part of the host) is called a host controller or (in storage contexts) a host bus adapter. The controller on the peripheral side (physically part of the peripheral device) is called a peripheral controller; examples are disk controllers and
