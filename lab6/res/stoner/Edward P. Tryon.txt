Edward P. Tryon
Edward P. Tryon (born September 4, 1940) is an American scientist and a professor emeritus of physics at Hunter College of the City University of New York. He was the first physicist to propose that our universe originated as a quantum fluctuation of the vacuum. Early life Tryon was born and raised in Terre Haute, Indiana. He took his first physics course in his junior year at Wiley High School. Academia and intellectual influences Tryon entered Cornell University in 1958. He was influenced by Nobel Laureate Hans Bethe, who was one of his professors. He was especially affected by advice that Bethe gave him: "Our intuition is based on our experiences in the macroscopic world. There is no reason to expect our intuition to be valid for microscopic phenomena." He graduated from Cornell University in 1962, earning a bachelors in physics. He would then go on to do his graduate work at the University of California, Berkeley. There he was very much influenced by Steven Weinberg. He took courses taught by Weinberg, who would later become a mentor to him. His doctoral thesis focused on the relationship between general relativity and quantum field theory and was titled: "Classical and Quantum
