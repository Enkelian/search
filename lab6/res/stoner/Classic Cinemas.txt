Notable features Classic Cinemas is known for its extensive and historically sensitive renovations of historic theatres some of which includes painstaking recreations of plasterwork, glass, and marquees. Classic Cinemas owners Willis and Shirley Johnson are members of a number of preservation societies and were awarded the Landmarks Illinois Richard H.
