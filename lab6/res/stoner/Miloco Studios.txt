Miloco Studios
Miloco Studios are a group of recording studios based in London, England. History Miloco was formed out of the merging of three former London recording studios: Milo Music, The Garden and Orinoco Studios. Milo Music began in 1984 as a small studio in east London's Hoxton Square (the studio is commonly referred to as simply 'The Square'), which was used by the likes of Tricky, M People and The Brand New Heavies in the early years of its life. In the early nineties they took over another building nearby to The Square and used it to build seven programming suites for artists and producers to use for long-term periods. Today, Miloco still operate five of the seven rooms, and people filling them currently include pop producer Richard X and Swing Out Sister. The Garden studio, located in the Shoreditch area of East London, was built in 1981 by John Foxx and studio designer Andy Munro. It became a regular choice of studios for the likes of Siouxsie and the Banshees, The Cure and Depeche Mode, as well as Matt Johnson of The The who ended up buying the studio for himself. Milo Music became the studio's representative from the mid-1990s,
