Milwaukee Mile
The Milwaukee Mile is an approximately one mile-long (1.6 km) oval race track in the central United States, located on the grounds of the Wisconsin State Fair Park in West Allis, Wisconsin, a suburb west of Milwaukee. Its grandstand and bleachers seated approximately 37,000 spectators. Paved 66 years ago in 1954, it was originally a dirt track. In addition to the oval, there was a 1.8 mile (2.8 km) road circuit located on the infield.

The track has held events sanctioned by major bodies, such as the AAA, USAC, NASCAR, CART/Champ Car World Series, and the IndyCar Series. There have also been many races in regional series such as ARTGO. Famous racers who have competed at the track include: Barney Oldfield, Ralph DePalma, Walt Faulkner, Parnelli Jones, A. J.
