Muziekkrant OOR
OOR is the oldest currently published music magazine in the Netherlands. Oor is the Dutch word for ear. Until 1984 it was published as Muziekkrant OOR. History The magazine was first published on 1 April 1971, being founded by Barend Toet. Of the first issue 20,000 copies were printed and paid for by Berry Visser, one of the co-founders of Mojo Concerts. The magazine was sold to Levisson (Graficus) on 1 January 1972. In 1978 the magazine was bought by Elsevier. Halfway through the 1990s, OOR was sold to the Telegraaf Media Group. In 2002, OOR was bought by Erik de Vlieger's Imca Media Group. Since 2006, Argo Media is the owner. Originally, OOR was published as a newspaper, hence the word 'krant' in the name. From the 1980s onward, the word Muziekkrant was dropped from the title and OOR had become a magazine. Around 2005, also the frequency changed. Originally a bi-weekly publication, OOR is now a glossy monthly. Notable journalists Bert van de Kamp External links www.oor.nl
