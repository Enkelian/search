The Tennessee Fire
The Tennessee Fire is the debut album by the rock band My Morning Jacket. It introduced the reverb-heavy sound that is characteristic of the band's early material. This is most apparent in Jim James' vocals, many of which were recorded in an improvised studio above his cousin’s garage. Of the sixteen tracks on the album, only four were re-recorded in a professional studio prior to the album’s release: “Heartbreakin Man”, “The Bear”, “Evelyn Is Not Real”, and “I Think I’m Going to Hell”.
