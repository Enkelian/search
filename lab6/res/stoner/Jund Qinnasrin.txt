Jund Qinnasrin
Jund Qinnasrīn (Arabic: جُـنْـد قِـنَّـسْـرِيْـن‎, "military district of Qinnasrin") was one of five sub-provinces of Syria under the Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphate, organized soon after the Muslim conquest of Syria in the 7th century CE.

By 985, the district's principal towns were Manbij, Iskandarun, Hamah, Shaizar, Ma'arrat al-Numan, Sumaisat, Jusiya, Wadi-Butnam, Rafaniyya, Lajjun, Mar'ash, Qinnasrin, al-Tinah, Balis, and Suwadiyyah.

The newly established district was named after the ancient town of Qinnasrin which was located within its boundaries.
