Overkill (Motörhead song)
"Overkill" is a song by the British hard rock band Motörhead. It was released in 7" and 12" vinyl pressings in 1979. It is backed with B-side "Too Late Too Late" which appears on the CD re-issues of the Overkill album. Early copies came with a free "Overkill" badge. The single reached number 39 on the UK Singles Chart. On 9 March 1979, the band played this song on the BBC TV show Top of the Pops to support the release of the single. The song was a live favourite and was frequently featured at Motörhead concerts, often in an extended version. The artwork on the sleeve was created by Joe Petagno, based on his design for the album's cover. The song is featured as a track in the video game SSX on Tour, and was re-recorded by Motörhead to be a playable track in the rhythm game Guitar Hero World Tour. The track is notable for Phil "Philthy Animal" Taylor's use of two bass drums. "Overkill" was used as the closing song for Motörhead's final tour, making it the last song the band ever played live. On 13 April 2019, Motörhead re-released the original single edit of Overkill along
