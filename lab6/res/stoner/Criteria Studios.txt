Criteria Studios
Criteria Studios is a recording studio in Miami, Florida, founded in 1958 by musician Mack Emerman (1923â€“2013), and which went on to become the source of many hit records, especially in the 1970s. The studio was originally designed by Hollywood, Florida, architect Charles C. Reed, Jr. Subsequent additions, acoustic design and renovations completed by others. History Many top artists and producers have used Criteria. Hundreds of Gold, Platinum or Diamond singles and albums have been recorded, mixed or mastered at Criteria, including "Layla", "I Feel Good" and Eat a Peach, as well as parts of Hotel California and Rumours. Atlantic Records regularly used the studios to record their roster of artists in the 1970s, through a connection with Tom Dowd, a leading staff engineer-producer with the label. The Bee Gees worked in Criteria in the mid- to late 1970s and early 1980s, most notably during recording of Main Course (1975) and Spirits Having Flown (1979). In 1999, The Hit Factory purchased Criteria Studios, revamping and re-opening the studios under the new name The Hit Factory Criteria Miami. In 2017, the facility once again reverted to the original Criteria Studios name. Selected artists Artists who have recorded singles or albums at
