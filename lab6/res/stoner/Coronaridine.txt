Coronaridine
Coronaridine, also known as 18-carbomethoxyibogamine, is an alkaloid found in Tabernanthe iboga and related species, including Tabernaemontana divaricata for which (under the now obsolete synonym Ervatamia coronaria) it was named.Coronaridine persistently reduces the self-administration of cocaine and morphine in rats. Pharmacology Coronaridine has been reported to bind to an assortment of molecular sites, including: μ-opioid (Ki = 2.0 μM), δ-opioid (Ki = 8.1 μM), and κ-opioid receptors (Ki = 4.3 μM), NMDA receptor (Ki = 6.24 μM) (as an antagonist), and nAChRs (as an antagonist). It has also been found to inhibit the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, act as a voltage-gated sodium channel blocker, and displays estrogenic activity in rodents. In contrast to ibogaine and other iboga alkaloids, coronaridine does not bind to either the σ1 or σ2 receptor. Coronaridine also has estrogenic properties.
