Monterey Colonial architecture
Monterey Colonial is an architectural style developed in Alta California (today's state of California when under Mexican rule). The style is characterized by two stories, continuous surrounding porches on both levels, a hip roof, and adobe walls. The first known example of the style was the Alpheus Thompson house in Santa Barbara, California, built in 1834 and demolished in 1913. The second (and oldest surviving) example is the Larkin House in Monterey, California, built by Thomas O. Larkin in 1835. The largest example of the style is the Rancho Petaluma Adobe, begun by Mariano Vallejo in Petaluma, California in 1836. Revivals of the style have been popular in the 20th century, substituting wood framing or brick for adobe. Other common variations use gable-end roofs and second-story-only covered porches. Monterey Colonial is one of the "non-Hispanic" historical styles recognized (though not encouraged for new construction) by the architectural design guidelines of Santa Barbara, California.
