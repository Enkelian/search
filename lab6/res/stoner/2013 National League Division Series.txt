2013 National League Division Series
The 2013 National League Division Series were two best-of-five-game series to determine the baseball teams to participate in the 2013 National League Championship Series. The three divisional winners (seeded 1-3 based on record) and a fourth team — the winner of a one-game Wild Card playoff — played in two series. TBS carried most of the games, with some on MLB Network. These matchups were: (1) St. Louis Cardinals (Central Division champions, 97–65) vs. (4) Pittsburgh Pirates (Wild Card Game winner, 94–68) (2) Atlanta Braves (East Division champions, 96–66) vs. (3) Los Angeles Dodgers (West Division champions, 92–70)The restriction on teams from the same division meeting in the Division Series was removed prior to the 2012 season. Therefore, the Cardinals and Pirates, both from the Central Division, were able to meet in the Division Series. Under the format used from 1998-2011, (1) St. Louis would have faced (3) Los Angeles in one Division Series, and (2) Atlanta would have faced (4) Pittsburgh in the other. This was the first postseason meeting between the current National League Central division rivals St. Louis and Pittsburgh. The Pirates made their first postseason appearance since 1992, and their first appearance in the Division Series
