Public understanding of science
Public awareness of science (PAwS), public understanding of science (PUS), or more recently, public engagement with science and technology (PEST) are terms relating to the attitudes, behaviours, opinions, and activities that comprise the relations between the general public or lay society as a whole to scientific knowledge and organisation. It is a comparatively new approach to the task of exploring the multitude of relations and linkages science, technology, and innovation have among the general public. While earlier work in the discipline had focused on augmenting public knowledge of scientific topics, in line with the information deficit model of science communication, the discrediting of the model has led to an increased emphasis on how the public chooses to use scientific knowledge and on the development of interfaces to mediate between expert and lay understandings of an issue. Major themes The area integrates a series of fields and themes such as: Science communication in the mass media, Internet, radio, films and television programmes Science museums, aquaria, planetaria, zoological parks, botanical gardens, etc. Public controversies over science and technology Fixed and mobile science exhibits Science festivals Science fairs in schools and social groups Science education for adults Science and social movements Media and
