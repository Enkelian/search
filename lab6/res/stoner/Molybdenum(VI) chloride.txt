Molybdenum(VI) chloride
Molybdenum(VI) chloride is the inorganic compound with the formula MoCl6. It is a black diamagnetic solid. The molecules adopt an octahedral structure as seen in tungsten(VI) chloride. Preparation and reactions Molybdenum(VI) chloride is prepared from the molybdenum hexafluoride with excess boron trichloride: 2 MoF6 + 6 BCl3 → MoCl6 + 6 BF2ClIt is unstable at room temperature with respect to molybdenum(V) chloride and decomposition completes within several days: 2 MoCl6 → [MoCl5]2 + Cl2 == References ==
