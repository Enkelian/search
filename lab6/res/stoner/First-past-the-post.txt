First-past-the-post
In a first-past-the-post (FPTP or FPP; formally called single-member plurality voting or SMP) electoral system members of the electorate cast their vote for the candidate of their choice and the candidate who receives the most votes wins, even if they did not receive a majority of the votes. First-past-the-post voting is a plurality voting method. FPTP is a common electoral system, especially in systems that use single-member electoral divisions. While most countries use forms of proportional representation, FPTP is used in about a quarter of the world's countries, usually in the English-speaking world (the United States, the United Kingdom, India, Pakistan, Canada and other countries in the British Commonwealth).
