In Color (album)
In Color is the second studio album by Cheap Trick, released in 1977. It was produced by Tom Werman. This album is considered a classic of the power pop genre. The album was ranked No. 4 on Shake Some Action: The Ultimate Power Pop Guide. In 2003, the album was also ranked number 443 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Overview In Color, as opposed to the band's self-titled debut, features a more polished production in the hopes of making a commercial impact. While the bandleader Rick Nielsen felt the album may have lost some of its power due to Tom Werman's more layered production, In Color does show the band's more melodic side that was partially lost on the debut. The album made the band superstars in Japan, where "I Want You to Want Me" and "Clock Strikes Ten" were hit singles. Five of the ten tracks on In Color were later released in live form on Cheap Trick's classic live album Cheap Trick at Budokan ("Hello There", "Big Eyes", "I Want You to Want Me", "Clock Strikes Ten" and "Come On, Come On").
