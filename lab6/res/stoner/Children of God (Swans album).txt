Children of God (Swans album)
Children of God is the fifth studio album by American experimental rock band Swans. It was released on October 19, 1987, through record label Caroline. Release history Children of God was re-issued along with the World of Skin compilation (minus the covers) on CD in 1997 as Children of God/World of Skin. On this re-release, the original album version of "Our Love Lies" was replaced with the version included on the Love Will Tear Us Apart EP. Also, the re-release added "Damn You to Hell" and "I'll Swallow You" (under one title as "I'll Swallow You") from the New Mind single as a bonus. Also, "Sex, God, Sex", "Beautiful Child" and "Children of God" were shortened by several seconds with earlier fade-outs and "Trust Me" faded directly into the brief interlude at the end.
