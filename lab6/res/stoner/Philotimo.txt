Philotimo
Philotimo (also spelled filotimo; Greek: φιλότιμο) is a Greek noun translating to "love of honor". However, philotimo is almost impossible to translate sufficiently as it describes a complex array of virtues. Ancient uses The word is used in early writings, sometimes in a bad sense; Plato's Republic uses philotimon (φιλότιμον) ironically: "covetous of honor"; other writers use philotimeomai (φιλοτιμέομαι) in the sense of "lavish upon". However, later uses develop the word in its more noble senses. By the beginning of the Christian era, the word was firmly a positive and its use in the Bible probably cemented its use in modern Greek culture. The word philotimon is used extensively in Hellenistic period literature. Biblical uses The word appears three times in the text of letters written by the Apostle Paul. Paul was a fluent Greek speaker and, by his writing, shows he was well educated in Hellene literature. His letters were originally written in Greek and therefore the choice of the word was deliberate and the sophisticated choice of an educated man. It is a difficult word to translate into English and is rendered variously depending on the Bible translation. Valid alternatives include; ambition, endeavour earnestly, aspire, being zealous, strive
