Film Score Monthly
Film Score Monthly is an online magazine (and former print magazine) founded by editor-in-chief and executive producer Lukas Kendall in June 1990 as The Soundtrack Correspondence List. It is dedicated to the art of film and television scoring. Film Score Monthly released 250 film and television scores on CD between 1996 and 2013. The International Film Music Critics Association named it Soundtrack Label of the Year in 2004 and Film Music Record Label of the Year in 2005. History In September 1991, Film Score Monthly began as The Soundtrack Club, a pamphlet sized publication maintained by Lukas Kendall, who was attending Amherst College at the time. In June 1992, the publication was renamed Film Score Monthly and, upon Kendall's graduation in 1996, relocated its base of operations to Los Angeles. At the same time Film Score Monthly revamped its format, introduced full-color covers, increased its length and enjoyed the peak of its circulation. FSM existed in this guise for nearly a decade. In 2005, it was announced that the magazine would cease publication of the print edition and move online-only where it could include multi-media content and address the technological advances inherent to the Web in the 21st century.
