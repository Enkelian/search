28th Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union
The 28th Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was elected by the 28th Central Committee in the aftermath of the 28th Congress. The new politburo was expunged and weakened, and apart from Mikhail Gorbachev himself, no members also held positions in the state or government leadership of the Soviet Union. Included in the new politburo were all the republic party heads. The resulting geographical diversity made the past practice of weekly meetings impractical. In addition, the category of nonvoting candidate members was dropped. List of members == References ==
