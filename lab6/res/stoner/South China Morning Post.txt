South China Morning Post
The South China Morning Post (SCMP), with its Sunday edition, the Sunday Morning Post, is a Hong Kong English-language newspaper founded in 1903. It is Hong Kong's newspaper of record, owned by Alibaba Group. The journal was founded by Australian-born anti-Qing dynasty revolutionary Tse Tsan-tai and British journalist Alfred Cunningham (formerly with China Mail, Hong Kong Daily Press and New York Sun), with the first edition of the paper published on 6 November 1903. Editor-in-chief Tammy Tam succeeded Wang Xiangwei in 2016. SCMP prints paper editions in Hong Kong and operates an online news website. The journal's circulation has been relatively stable for yearsâ€”the average daily circulation stood at 100,000 in 2016. A 2019 survey from the Chinese University of Hong Kong sampling 1079 local households suggested that SCMP was seen as the most credible paid newspaper in Hong Kong.It was owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation until it was acquired by Malaysian real estate tycoon Robert Kuok in 1993. On 5 April 2016, Alibaba Group acquired the media properties of the SCMP Group, including the South China Morning Post. In January 2017, Gary Liu, a former web company executive from New York, joined SCMP as chief executive officer (CEO).
