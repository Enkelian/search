Grenoble Institute of Technology
The Grenoble Institute of Technology (Grenoble INP) (Institut polytechnique de Grenoble, Groupe Grenoble INP and before INPG) is a French technological university system consisting of six engineering schools. Grenoble INP also has a two-year preparatory class programme, an adult education department, as well as 21 laboratories and a graduate school in Engineering Sciences. More than 1,100 engineers graduate every year from Grenoble INP, making it France's biggest grande école. Most of Grenoble INP is located in Grenoble, except for the ESISAR which is located in Valence. History Grenoble INP was born in the Alpine environment. It was officially founded in 1900 with the creation of the Electrical Engineering Institute. Industrial pioneers of a century ago found that after mastering hydraulic power and creating the initial industrial applications, they had also created a need for well-trained engineers. The first of its type in France, Grenoble INP became polytechnical and grew continuously in scale, becoming the National Polytechnical Institute (INPG) in 1971 with Louis Néel, Nobel Laureate in Physics as its first President. Grenoble INP is currently contributing to the Minatec project, one of Europe's biggest nanosciences research center. Since December 2014, Grenoble Institute of Technology is member of the Community Grenoble
