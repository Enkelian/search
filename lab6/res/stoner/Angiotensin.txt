Angiotensin
Angiotensin is a peptide hormone that causes vasoconstriction and an increase in blood pressure. It is part of the renin–angiotensin system, which regulates blood pressure. Angiotensin also stimulates the release of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex to promote sodium retention by the kidneys. An oligopeptide, angiotensin is a hormone and a dipsogen. It is derived from the precursor molecule angiotensinogen, a serum globulin produced in the liver. Angiotensin was isolated in the late 1930s (first named 'angiotonin' or 'hypertensin') and subsequently characterized and synthesized by groups at the Cleveland Clinic and Ciba laboratories. Precursor and types Angiotensinogen Angiotensinogen is an α-2-globulin synthesized in the liver and is a precursor for angiotensin, but has also been indicated as having many other roles not related to angiotensin peptides. It is a member of the serin family of proteins, leading to another name: Serin A8, although it is not known to inhibit other enzymes like most serins. In addition, a generalized crystal structure can be estimated by examining other proteins of the serin family, but angiotensinogen has an elongated N-terminus compared to other serin family proteins.Angiotensinogen is also known as renin substrate. It is cleaved at the N-terminus by renin to result in
