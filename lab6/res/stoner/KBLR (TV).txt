KBLR, virtual channel 39 (UHF digital channel 20), is a Telemundo owned-and-operated television station serving Las Vegas, Nevada, United States that is licensed to the nearby unincorporated community of Paradise. The station is owned by the Telemundo Station Group subsidiary of NBCUniversal. KBLR's studios are located on Fremont Street in downtown Las Vegas, and its transmitter is located on Black Mountain near Henderson. History The station was founded in 1988 by Glenn Rose, an entrepreneur who found early success as a franchisee in Southern California of Nutrisystem and used the wealth from that effort to found KBLR, a station whose call letters were inspired by the initials of his wife. During its first two years of operation, it mainly carried ethnic programming for several underserved audiences in the area, including African-American and Asian-American audiences, though it found more strength programming for the area's surging Hispanic audience. The station also carried second-run programming such as G.I. Joe and public domain B movies. In 1993, Rose sold the station to a partnership known as Summit Media. Scott Gentry would build the station from its early roots into the first full-power Spanish-language television station in Las Vegas, eventually taking on a Telemundo affiliation
