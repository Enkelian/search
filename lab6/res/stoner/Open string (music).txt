While an instrument might be in tune relative to its own range of notes, it may not be considered 'in tune' if it does not match the chosen reference pitch. Some instruments become 'out of tune' with temperature, humidity, damage, or just time, and must be readjusted or repaired. Different methods of sound production require different methods of adjustment: Tuning to a pitch with one's voice is called matching pitch and is the most basic skill learned in ear training.
