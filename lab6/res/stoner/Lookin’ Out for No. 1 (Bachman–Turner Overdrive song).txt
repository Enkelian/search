Lookin’ Out for No. 1 (Bachman–Turner Overdrive song)
"Lookin’ Out for #1" is a 1975 song written by Randy Bachman and first recorded by Canadian rock group Bachman–Turner Overdrive (BTO) for their December, 1975 album Head On. The lead vocal is provided by Randy Bachman. Released in early 1976, it was the second of two singles from the LP to be issued in North America, following "Take It Like a Man". A departure from BTO’s earlier heavy rock releases, "Lookin’ Out for #1" was strongly influenced by Randy’s jazz upbringing and tutelage under Lenny Breau. In his book Randy Bachman’s Vinyl Tap Stories, Randy stated: "The chord progression on ‘Lookin’ Out for #1’ came from the Mickey Baker Guitar Book that Lenny Breau had told me about when I was a teenager. It was a chance for me to stretch out a bit on the guitar. It’s still among my most requested live songs, and made the transition to my jazz career.""Lookin’ Out for #1" did not perform particularly well on the U.S. Billboard pop charts, peaking at #65 on May 15, 1976 and spending just six weeks in the Hot 100. On the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart, however, it was a Top 20 hit, peaking at #15
