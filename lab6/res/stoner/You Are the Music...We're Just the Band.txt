You Are the Music...We're Just the Band
You Are the Music...We're Just the Band is the third studio album by English hard rock band Trapeze. Recorded with producer Neil Slaven, it was released in 1972 by Threshold Records. The album was preceded by the release of the single "Coast to Coast" in 1972. Background You Are the Music...We're Just the Band was the last Trapeze album recorded by the lineup of Glenn Hughes, Mel Galley and Dave Holland, as Hughes left the band in 1973 to join Deep Purple. The album was also the band's first not to be produced by John Lodge, and featured a wide range of guest performers, including guitarist B. J. Cole, pianist Rod Argent and saxophonist Jimmy Hastings. Five of the album's eight songs were written by Hughes, while the other three were written by Galley and his brother Tom. Reception Critical reception for You Are the Music...We're Just the Band was generally positive. A review published on AllMusic awarded the album four out of five stars, with writer Richard Foss praising Hughes's vocal performances and the "softer tunes" of the album. Foss named "Coast to Coast" and "What Is a Woman's Role" as particular highlights. Track listing Personnel == References ==
