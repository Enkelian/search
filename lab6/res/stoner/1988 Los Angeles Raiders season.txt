1988 Los Angeles Raiders season
The 1988 Los Angeles Raiders season was the franchise's 29th season overall, and the franchise's 19th season in the National Football League. Mike Shanahan was hired as head coach, and the club finished with a 7â€“9 record. The Raiders drafted Heisman Trophy winner Tim Brown, making Brown the third person on the Raiders roster to have won the Heisman Trophy, the others being Marcus Allen and Bo Jackson. Most of the team's success throughout the season came through their division, as the Raiders finished 6-2 against the weak AFC West division, with their only 2 losses against the champions of the division, the Seattle Seahawks. However, the Raiders were only 1-7 against the rest of the NFL, with their only other win coming against the eventual champions, the 49ers in San Francisco in a game in which only field goals were kicked.
