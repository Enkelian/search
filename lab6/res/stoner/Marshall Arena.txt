Marshall Arena
The Marshall Arena (formerly Arena MK, also Milton Keynes Arena) is a multi-purpose arena in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, England and is located beside Stadium MK. The 3,420 square metres (36,800 sq ft) multi-use event space is positioned over three floors and anticipates music and sporting events, conferences and exhibitions and parties. History Marshall Arena was to be the home of the Milton Keynes Lions professional basketball team. However, the retail developments that would have provided enabling funding were deferred due to lack of financing, leaving the Lions without a home. Following the conclusion of the 2011â€“12 season, the Lions could not secure a venue within Milton Keynes, resulting in a move south to the Copper Box.It officially opened on 8 February 2014 when it hosted the 2014 English National Badminton Championships. The Arena has hosted the Professional Darts Corporation's Masters tournament since 2015. In September 2018, Marshall Amplification announced an agreement with Arena MK to use the space for music events, rebranding it the Marshall Arena. References External links Official website
