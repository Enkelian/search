Buzzov•en
Buzzoven (typeset Buzzov•en) is an American heavy metal band from Salisbury, North Carolina, United States, formed in 1990. The band was known for being one of the founders of the sludge genre along with NOLA's Eyehategod and Acid Bath, and also for their out-of-control and violent live shows. The band in its early days toured heavily around the United States and built up a cult following leading up to the release of their debut album, To a Frown (1993), which caught the attention of Roadrunner Records, who released the band's second album Sore (1994). The band was dropped by Roadrunner, and from then on have gone through several periods of being split-up and reformed, with the only constant member having been Kirk Fisher. In 2018, the band toured the Southern US as one of the opening acts for Eyehategod.
