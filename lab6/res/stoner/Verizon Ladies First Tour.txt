Verizon Ladies First Tour
The Verizon Ladies First Tour was a co-headlining concert tour by American recording artists Beyoncé, Alicia Keys and Missy Elliott. Canadian artist Tamia was featured as a special guest. The tour, dubbed the "urban Lilith Fair" supported Elliott's fifth studio album, This Is Not a Test!; Keys' second studio album, The Diary of Alicia Keys and Beyoncé's first studio album, Dangerously in Love. The trek visited the United States performing in over twenty cities in March and April. The outing was the first three-act show to feature three female R&B artist in a headlining role. It became one of the biggest tours in 2004, placing 34th on Pollstar's "Top Tours of 2004"—earning over 22 million dollars. The success of the tour promoted a 2005 leg but the plans were scrapped and Verzion focused on creating the Verizon VIP Tour. Background The tour was originally supposed to feature Beyoncé with Ashanti, Monica, Mýa and Mary J. Blige but scheduling conflicts caused the other four ladies not to be up for the tour. When the tour was officially announced, it was Beyoncé, along with Keys, Elliott, and Tamia joining the bill. The tour was announced by various media outlets in January 2004.
