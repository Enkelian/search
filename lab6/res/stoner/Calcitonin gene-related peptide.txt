Calcitonin gene-related peptide
Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a member of the calcitonin family of peptides, which in humans exists in two forms: α-CGRP and β-CGRP, also known as CGRP I and CGRP II. α-CGRP is a 37-amino acid neuropeptide and is formed from the alternative splicing of the calcitonin/CGRP gene located on chromosome 11. β-CGRP is less studied. In humans, β-CGRP differs from the α-CGRP by three amino acids and is encoded in a separate gene within the same vicinity. The CGRP family includes calcitonin (CT), adrenomedullin (AM), and amylin (AMY). This article outlines the basic function of CGRP as well as sources of production and synthesis. It further introduces receptors and regulation of CGRP, with a focus on human and mammalian systems. Function CGRP is produced in both peripheral and central neurons. It is a potent peptide vasodilator and can function in the transmission of nociception. In the spinal cord, the function and expression of CGRP may differ depending on the location of synthesis. CGRP is derived mainly from the cell bodies of motor neurons when synthesized in the ventral horn of the spinal cord and may contribute to the regeneration of nervous tissue after injury. Conversely, CGRP is derived from
