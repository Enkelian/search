Telecommunications equipment
Telecommunications equipment (also telecoms equipment or communications equipment) is a hardware which is used for the purposes of telecommunications. Since the 1990s the boundary between telecoms equipment and IT hardware has become blurred as a result of the growth of the internet and its increasing role in the transfer of telecoms data. Types Telecommunications equipment can be broadly broken down into the following categories: Public switching equipment Analogue switches Digital switches Voice over IP switches Transmission equipment Transmission lines Optical fiber Local loops Base transceiver stations Free-space optical communication Laser communication in space Multiplexers Communications satellites Customer premises equipment (CPE) Customer office terminal Private switches Local area networks (LANs) Modems Mobile phones Landline telephones Answering machines Teleprinters Fax machines Pagers Routers Wireless devices Semiconductors Most of the essential elements of modern telecommunication are built from MOSFETs (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors), including mobile devices, transceivers, base station modules, routers, RF power amplifiers, microprocessors, memory chips, and telecommunication circuits. As of 2005, telecommunications equipment account for 16.5% of the annual microprocessor market.
