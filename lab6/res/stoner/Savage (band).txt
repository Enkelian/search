Savage (band)
Savage are a British heavy metal band from Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, England, which formed in 1978.The band is most remembered for the song titled "Let it Loose", a track which made significant impact on the early 1980s metal scene (indeed, it was later covered by Metallica on their Whiskey Audition Tape demo), and would later give rise to the name of their first album, Loose 'N Lethal, released in 1983. History The group was formed in 1976 by 16-year-old bass player Chris Bradley, vocalist Chris Gent, guitarist Lee Statham and drummer Mick Percival, but after only one official gig the band disbanded and was re-formed in 1978 by Bradley, joined by Andy Bradbury on guitar, Simon Dawson on drums and his 15-year-old brother Andy Dawson on guitar. Line-up issues continued as Andy Bradbury was replaced by Wayne Renshaw, and Simon Dawson left to be replaced after a long period of searching by Dave Lindley. This was the line up that appeared on the compilation albums Scene of the Crime (featuring "Let it Loose"), Metal Fatigue and the double A-side single "Ain't No Fit Place" / "The China Run". Lindley left shortly after this as was replaced by Mark Brown of Tyrant
