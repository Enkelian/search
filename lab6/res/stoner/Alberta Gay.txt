She was the only other person present at the murder of her son committed by his father. Biography Early life Alberta was born Alberta Williams Cooper on New Year's Day, 1913, in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. She had three sisters, Pearl, Tolie and Zeola, and a brother, Aster, but she would endure a troubled childhood while growing up in North Carolina: her father once shot at her mother during an argument. Although her mother survived, her father would later die in a psychiatric hospital. Alberta told David Ritz that she felt she really didn't have a father, and her family didn't put her in a school until she was eight years old.At 20 years of age, she had a child, a son named Michael, and as a result her mother sent her to live with a relative in Washington, D.C., where she met minister Reverend Marvin Gay in 1934
