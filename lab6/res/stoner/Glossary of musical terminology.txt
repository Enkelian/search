Glossary of musical terminology
This is a list of musical terms that are likely to be encountered in printed scores, music reviews, and program notes. Most of the terms are Italian (see also Italian musical terms used in English), in accordance with the Italian origins of many European musical conventions. Sometimes, the special musical meanings of these phrases differ from the original or current Italian meanings. Most of the other terms are taken from French and German, indicated by "Fr." and "Ger.", respectively. Unless specified, the terms are Italian or English. The list can never be complete: some terms are common, and others are used only occasionally, and new ones are coined from time to time. Some composers prefer terms from their own language rather than the standard terms listed here. 0–9 I in violin family instrument music, used to indicate that the player should play the passage on the highest-pitched, thinnest string 1′ "sifflet" or one foot organ stop ​1 3⁄5′ Tierce organ stop 2′ two feet – pipe organ indication; see Organ stop § Pitch and length II in violin family instrument music, used to indicate that the player should play the passage on the string adjacent to the highest-pitched, thinnest string
