Centre d'arts plastiques contemporains de Bordeaux
CAPC musée d'art contemporain de Bordeaux, formerly the Centre d'arts plastiques contemporains (CAPC), is a museum of modern art established in 1973 in Bordeaux, France. Building The museum is housed in the Entrepôt Lainé, a former warehouse for colonial goods (sugar, coffee, cocoa, cotton, spices and oils) which were then re-exported to northern Europe by Bordeaux merchants. The warehouse was built in 1824 by the architect Claude Deschamps, known for the construction of the Pont de pierre of Bordeaux. It is built of brick, stone and wood in a style inspired by italian architecture. There are two grand naves that are reminiscent of the roman basilicas and that are used to present temporary exhibitions. The building was restored by the architects Denis Valode and Jean Pistre in the 1980s, the second project that this architectural team had undertaken. Their treatment was unusual for the time, emphasizing shadows and depth.The designer Andrée Putman renovated the interior. The Café Putman, named after the decorator, has a minimalist decor of metal, concrete and natural materials such as teak and wicker. It has a terrace.Since 1981, the building also hosts Arc en rêve centre d'architecture, association that organises exhibitions and knowledge exchange about architecture,
