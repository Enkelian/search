Fulham Railway Bridge
Fulham Railway Bridge crosses the River Thames in London. It is very close to Putney Bridge, and carries the London Underground District line between Putney Bridge station on the North, and East Putney station on the South. Fulham Railway Bridge can also be crossed on foot, on the downstream (east) side. Originally referred to by its design engineers W.H. Thomas and William Jacomb as Putney Railway Bridge it has no official name, but for over a hundred years it has been known colloquially as "The Iron Bridge". History The bridge is of lattice girder construction and 418 metres long, with 5 spans totalling 301 metres actually across the river, two further spans on the southern shore, and one on the north. It was designed for the London and South Western Railway by Brunel's former assistant William Jacomb, built by Head Wrightson and opened in 1889.It was refurbished between 1995 and 1997 for The London Underground by Tilbury Douglas Construction Limited (now Interserve), and it was at that time that a plaque bearing the title Fulham Railway Bridge was attached to the pillar at the top of the pedestrian stairway on the Southern downstream side of the bridge.
