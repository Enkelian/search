Sam Edwards (physicist)
Sir Samuel Frederick Edwards FLSW FRS (1 February 1928 â€“ 7 May 2015), "universally known as 'Sam'," was a Welsh physicist. The Sam Edwards Medal and Prize is named in his honour. Early life and studies Sir Samuel was born on 1 February 1928 in Swansea, Wales, the son of Richard and Mary Jane Edwards. He was educated at the Bishop Gore School, Swansea, and Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, the University of Manchester, and at Harvard University, in the United States. He wrote his thesis under Julian Schwinger on the structure of the electron, and subsequently developed the functional integral form of field theory. Academic research Edwards' work in condensed matter physics started in 1958 with a paper which showed that statistical properties of disordered systems (glasses, gels etc.) could be described by the Feynman diagram and path integral methods invented in quantum field theory. During the following 35 years Edwards worked in the theoretical study of complex materials, such as polymers, gels, colloids and similar systems. His seminal paper came in 1965 which "in one stroke founded the modern quantitative understanding of polymer matter." Pierre-Gilles de Gennes notably extended Edwards' 1965 seminal work, ultimately leading to de Gennes'
