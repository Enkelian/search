Confessional poetry
Confessional poetry or "Confessionalism" is a style of poetry that emerged in the United States during the 1950s. It is sometimes also classified as a form of Postmodernism. It has been described as poetry of the personal or "I", focusing on extreme moments of individual experience, the psyche, and personal trauma, including previously and occasionally still taboo matters such as mental illness, sexuality, and suicide, often set in relation to broader social themes.This engagement with personal experience has been explained by literary critics as an effort by Confessional poets to distance themselves from horrifying social realities of the Twentieth century. Events like the Holocaust, the Cold War, and existential threat brought by the proliferation of nuclear weapons had made public matters daunting for both Confessional poets and their readers. The Confessional poets also worked in opposition to the idealization of domesticity in the 1950s, by revealing unhappiness in their own homes.The school of "Confessional poetry" was associated with several poets who redefined American poetry in the 1950s and 1960s, including Robert Lowell, Sylvia Plath, John Berryman, Anne Sexton, Allen Ginsberg, and W. D. Snodgrass. Life Studies and the emergence of Confessionalism In 1959 M. L. Rosenthal first used the term
