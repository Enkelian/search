Rice Radio
KTRU-LP (stylized as ktru) is the college radio station of Rice University, a private university in south-central Houston, Texas, United States. KTRU-LP broadcasts a freeform-eclectic music format on 96.1 FM; its programming includes modern classical, reggae, indie rock, screwed and chopped, spoken word and local experimental noise bands. During evening hours, the station broadcasts shows geared to particular musical genres and themes. The station is owned by the university, which maintains an FM transmitter atop Rice Stadium, and is managed by its students. The current KTRU-LP license dates to 2015, but Rice's first foray into FM radio began in 1971, and radio at the university has a history dating to 1967. History KTRU at 91.7 The roots of KTRU began in February 1967 in a residential college at Rice, Hanszen College, where several students broadcast music in the Old Section part of the dorm using an unlicensed 2-watt AM station, using the call sign KHCR (Hanszen College radio) and the wiring of a buzzer system. The next fall, the station transformed into an AM carrier current station with wires running through the steam tunnel system connecting the dormitories to a studio located in the basement of the Rice Memorial Center
