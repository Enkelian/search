Bowlie Weekender
The Bowlie Weekender was a music festival curated by Belle & Sebastian at the Pontin's Holiday camp in Camber Sands, Sussex between Friday 23 and Sunday 25 April 1999. The event was the inspiration for All Tomorrow's Parties, a music festival held at the same venue in Sussex every year from 2000 until it moved to Butlin's Minehead in 2006. As part of the festival's tenth year celebrations, Belle & Sebastian was invited to curate an ATP weekend in December 2010, dubbed "Bowlie 2".In August 2019, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the first festival, Belle & Sebastian held a third festival, dubbed the "Boaty Weekender". Unlike the previous two festivals, the Boaty Weekender was held on the Norwegian Pearl cruise ship in the Mediterranean Sea (sailing from Barcelona) instead of Camber Sands. 1999 Lineup The lineup included: AC Acoustics Amphetameanies Belle & Sebastian Broadcast Camera Obscura Cinema Cornelius Dean and Sean (Dean Wareham and Sean Eden of Luna) The Delgados The Divine Comedy The Flaming Lips Vic Godard Godspeed You!
