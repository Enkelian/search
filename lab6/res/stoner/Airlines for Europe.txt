Airlines for Europe
Airlines for Europe (A4E) is a trade association of European airlines created in January 2016. It handles political lobbying operations for the benefit of its 16 members. History Airlines for Europe was created in January 2016 by Europe's five largest carriers: IAG, Air France–KLM, EasyJet, Lufthansa and Ryanair. It was the first airlines trade association to have full-service and low-cost carriers as members. It was created in response to the perceived ineffectiveness of the previous major European airlines trade association, the now-defunct Association of European Airlines.Upon its creation, A4E declared war on supposedly subsidised airlines from the Gulf region that compete unfairly against other international airlines. According to Lobbyfacts.eu, A4E has six representatives actively lobbying at the European parliament.
