Boeing 707
The Boeing 707 is a narrow-body airliner produced by Boeing Commercial Airplanes, its first jetliner. Developed from the Boeing 367-80, a prototype first flown in 1954, the initial 707-120 first flew on December 20, 1957. Pan American World Airways began regular 707 service on October 26, 1958, and it was built until 1979. A quadjet, the 707 has a swept wing with podded engines. Derived from the 367-80 prototype, its larger fuselage cross-section allowed six-abreast economy seating, retained in the later 720, 727, 737, and 757. Although it was not the first commercial jetliner in service, the 707 was the first to be widespread and is often credited with initiating the Jet Age. It dominated passenger air transport in the 1960s and remained common through the 1970s, on domestic, transcontinental, and transatlantic flights, as well as cargo and military applications. It established Boeing as a dominating airliner manufacturer with its 7x7 series. The initial, 145-foot-long (44 m) 707-120 was powered by Pratt & Whitney JT3C turbojet engines. The shortened long-range 707-138 and the lighter 707-220 entered service in 1959. The longer range, heavier 707-300/400 series have a larger wing and are slightly stretched by 8 feet (2.4 m).
