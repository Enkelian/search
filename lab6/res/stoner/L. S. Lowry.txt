L. S. Lowry
Laurence Stephen Lowry ( LAO-ree; 1 November 1887 – 23 February 1976) was an English artist. Many of his drawings and paintings depict Pendlebury, Lancashire, where he lived and worked for more than 40 years, Salford and its vicinity. Lowry is famous for painting scenes of life in the industrial districts of North West England in the mid-20th century. He developed a distinctive style of painting and is best known for his urban landscapes peopled with human figures often referred to as "matchstick men". He painted mysterious unpopulated landscapes, brooding portraits and the unpublished "marionette" works, which were only found after his death. Use of stylized figures and lack of weather effects in many of his landscapes have led to a label of naïve "Sunday painter"A collection of Lowry's work is on display in The Lowry, a purpose-built art gallery on Salford Quays. Lowry rejected five honours during his life, including a knighthood (1968). He holds the record for the most rejected British honours. On 26 June 2013 a major retrospective opened at the Tate Britain in London, his first at the Tate and in 2014 his first solo exhibition outside the UK was held in Nanjing, China. Early life
