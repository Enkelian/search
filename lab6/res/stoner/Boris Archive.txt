Boris Archive
Boris Archive is a three disc collection of live material by Japanese band Boris. The first disc comprises various live renditions of older songs and material from Amplifier Worship and the Boris/Barebones split EP. The second disc is three drumless drone songs. The third disc is a live set consisting of the 65-minute Absolutego and the 70-minute Flood played back-to-back in 37 minutes. Altogether, 600 copies of each disc were pressed with the intention of being sold individually. However, due to strong demand for all three, a set consisting of an obi-style horizontal slipcase enclosing the three discs was created and limited to 320 copies.All 3 discs were re-released together in 2013 through Daymare Recordings with new artwork.
