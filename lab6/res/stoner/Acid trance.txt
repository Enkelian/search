Acid trance
Acid trance is a genre of trance music that emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s focusing on using the acid sound.

This real-time tone adjustment was not part of the instrument's original intended operation. Acid trance is the best known form of trance music in Belgium. The form was first showcased at the popular Antwerp Rave 24 in Belgium, and has created four national number one singles in the country since.Acid trance may be considered a descendant of acid house, since the genre of trance had not yet been invented during the advent of acid house (or acidhouse).The first volumes of Trancemaster compilations contains a few tracks in acid trance style, just as classic trance tracks.

The line between these two styles is quite blurred;
