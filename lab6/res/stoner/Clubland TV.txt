Clubland TV
Clubland TV is a British free-to-air Dance music channel. It is based from the Clubland compilation albums. Clubland TV airs various sub-genres of dance music, such as dance, EDM, electronic, techno, trance, eurodance, house, remixes, garage, K-pop & dance-pop History The channel launched on 28 January 2008. As of March 2008, the channel had five times the viewing ratings than its main competition MTV Dance. As of July 2019, the channel still dominates the ratings over its main rival MTV Dance (now Club MTV). The channel was initially run in partnership with Mushroom TV Ltd, former operator of Channel AKA and Starz TV, as this company had an established system for the operation of viewer-voted music channels. On 17 February 2010 Clubland's broadcasting was changed to a brand new, bespoke playout facility. The text number for song voting changed as did some song voting codes, and the channel is now broadcast in 16:9 widescreen format (having been in 4:3 fullscreen during the Mushroom era.) The channel is now solely controlled (including all playout and technical support services) by the team behind the highly successful Clubland compilation album series.From January 2014 the channel has been available to stream on mobile devices
