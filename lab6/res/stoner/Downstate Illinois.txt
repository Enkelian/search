Downstate Illinois
Downstate Illinois refers to the part of the U.S. state of Illinois south of ("down") the Chicago metropolitan area, which is in the northeast corner of the state and has been dominant in its history, politics, and culture. It has also by extension referred to the part of the state west of the Chicago area but at the same or greater latitude, including Rockford, which is north of Chicago. Prior to the issuance of 2000 Census results, when it became part of the Chicago metropolitan area, even DeKalb (located 65 miles west of Chicago) was often considered to be "downstate".The term has been part of the Illinois lingo for decades, and is commonly used by the media. The Illinois General Assembly regularly uses the term in the titles of bills it passes. Definition Downstate Illinois lacks a precise definition. Various boundaries that have been used are the Chicago city limits, Interstate 80, and Bloomington. Major cities Most of the state's largest cities (six of the top ten) are concentrated in and around the Chicago area, but several mid-sized cities exist in the downstate area as well.
