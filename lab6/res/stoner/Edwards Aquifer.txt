Edwards Aquifer
The Edwards Aquifer is one of the most prolific artesian aquifers in the world. Located on the eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau in the U.S. state of Texas, it is the source of drinking water for two million people, and is the primary water supply for agriculture and industry in the aquifer's region. In addition, the Edwards Aquifer feeds the Comal and San Marcos springs, provides springflow for recreational and downstream uses in the Nueces, San Antonio, Guadalupe, and San Marcos river basins, and is home to several unique and endangered species. Water balance Although between 25 and 55 million acre-feet of water may be present in the Edwards aquifer, only a small portion of this water is practically or legally available for use. Storage is the difference between recharge (inputs) and discharge (outputs) from the Edwards Aquifer. Annual storage can be negative during dry years with high water use and positive during wet years with relatively low water use. A long-term negative imbalance between recharge and discharge in an aquifer may lead to the depletion of the available water in the aquifer. Annual storage between 1955 and 2012 estimated from data provided by a continuing program between the
