1990 Soviet Union presidential election
Presidential elections were held in the Soviet Union on 14 March 1990 to elect a president for a five-year term. This was the only presidential election in the Soviet Union, as the post of president was introduced in 1990, and the Soviet Union disintegrated in the following year. The elections were uncontested, with Mikhail Gorbachev as the only candidate.Although the constitution required the president to be directly-elected, it was decided that the first elections should be held on an indirect basis as it was necessary for a president to be elected immediately and processes taking place in the country did not leave time for elections to be held. Background On February 7, 1990, about a month prior to the election, Communist Party leaders voted on establishing a presidency. The third (extraordinary) Congress of People's Deputies of the USSR began on 12 March 1990. The congress decided to create the post of President of the USSR. The president would be elected to five-year terms. The CPD would elect the president for this election cycle, then turn over future elections to the public starting in 1995â€”which never happened due to the USSR's collapse in 1991.
