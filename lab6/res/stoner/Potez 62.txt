Potez 62
Potez 62 was a French twin-engine civil airliner, designed by Henry Potez in 1934. History The prototype of the Potez 62 made its maiden flight on January 28 1935. The aircraft had been developed from the Potez 54 bomber and was constructed as a high-wing monoplane. The wooden fuselage had a composite coating, whereas the wings were covered with fabric and the leading edge was made out of metal. The aircraft was propelled by two Gnôme & Rhône radial engines whose 14 cylinders produced some 870 hp. The engines were mounted in two side cradles, fixed to the fuselage and to the wings. The cabin was divided into two compartments and could accommodate 14 to 16 people. A version equipped with Hispano-Suiza V-engines was ordered by Air France in 1936. These were used on routes inside South America. By late 1936, many Potez 62s were employed on routes to Europe and the Far East, as the aircraft was robust and reliable, albeit slow. It remained in service until the Second World War, and one was used by the Free French Air Force.
