You (Marvin Gaye song)
"You" is a 1967 single released by American singer Marvin Gaye on the Tamla label. Released as the first single from Gaye's In the Groove album, it was written by Ivy Jo Hunter, Jack Goga and Jeffrey Bowen and produced by Hunter. The song talked of a man wanting to keep a rendezvous secret with one woman due to their differing social statuses, Marvin's narrator being working class, while the woman is upper class. Recorded after Gaye recorded his "I Heard It Through the Grapevine" single, it showcased a new rougher Gaye vocal than usual signaling a change in the singer's direction as he stepped away from the sophisticated-styled soul that dominated his mid-sixties releases. A modest hit on the pop charts peaking at number thirty-four, it was a top ten single on the R&B charts where it peaked at number seven.
