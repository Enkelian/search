Stylus Magazine
Stylus Magazine was an online music and film magazine launched in 2002. It featured long-form music journalism, four daily music reviews, movie reviews, podcasts, an MP3 blog, and a text blog. Additionally, Stylus had daily features like "The Singles Jukebox", which looked at pop singles from around the globe, and "Soulseeking", a column focused on personal responses in listening. In 2006, the site was chosen by the Observer Music Monthly as one of the Internet's 25 most essential music websites.Stylus closed as a business on 31 October 2007. The site remained online for several years, but did not publish any new content. On 4 January 2010, with the blessing of former editor Todd Burns, Stylus senior writer Nick Southall launched The Stylus Decade, a website with a new series of lists and essays reviewing music from the previous ten years: it is now also defunct. The Singles Jukebox relaunched with many of the same writers as a stand-alone website in March 2009. References External links The Singles Jukebox â€“ official site
