Guilty of Everything (Nothing album)
Guilty of Everything is the debut studio album by the American shoegaze band Nothing. It was released on March 4, 2014, by Relapse Records. Musical style The band's musical style has been described as a mixture of 1990s shoegaze, noise rock and slowcore, and also as "heavy dream pop" and "billowy alt-rock." Nevertheless, the band's sound differs from other shoegaze acts' in its loudness and heaviness, leading to comparisons to My Bloody Valentine's Loveless (1991), Smashing Pumpkins and Dinosaur Jr. Nothing has also been said to stay "current by also giving nods to the post-Brand New indie rock sound." According to Stephen Carlick of Exclaim!, Nothing's use of "towering distorted guitars, soaring falsettos and slamming, snare-heavy percussion" evoke "Slowdive's biggest moments, albeit with a little more passion." The vocals of lead singer Domenic Palermo, which are "hushed and buried in the mix," have been compared to Chapterhouse in terms of harmony.
