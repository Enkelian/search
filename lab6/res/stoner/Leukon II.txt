Leukon II
Leukon II of Bosporus (Greek: Λέυκων Β'; c. 240 – 220 BC), also known as Leuco, seems to have been the second son of Paerisades II and a Spartocid ruler of the Bosporan Kingdom in 240 BC due to his surviving coinage. Reign He killed his brother, Spartokos IV, after discovering his adulterous affair with Leukon's wife Alkathoe, and assumed the throne. Alkathoe later supposedly killed Leukon in an act of revenge.Leukon also supposedly endured an economic crisis in the 3rd century BC, where he minted new coins with his own name, in order to maintain his kingdom. He was the first Bosporan king to issue coins with his own name. Succession He was succeeded by Hygiainon after his death. Hygiainon, however, was not a member of the Spartocid dynasty and may have been a supporter of Kamasarye, the daughter and heiress of Spartokos V, who was, at the time, too young to rule.
