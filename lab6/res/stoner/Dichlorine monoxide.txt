Dichlorine monoxide
Dichlorine monoxide, is an inorganic compound with the molecular formula Cl2O. It was first synthesised in 1834 by Antoine Jérôme Balard, who along with Gay-Lussac also determined its composition. In older literature it is often referred to as chlorine monoxide, which can be a source of confusion as that name now refers to the neutral species ClO. At room temperature it exists as a brownish-yellow gas which is soluble in both water and organic solvents. Chemically, it is a member of the chlorine oxide family of compounds, as well as being the anhydride of hypochlorous acid. It is a strong oxidiser and chlorinating agent. Preparation The earliest method of synthesis was to treat mercury(II) oxide with chlorine gas. However this method is expensive, as well as highly dangerous due to the risk of mercury poisoning. 2 Cl2 + HgO → HgCl2 + Cl2OA safer and more convenient method of production is the reaction of chlorine gas with hydrated sodium carbonate, at 20-30 °C. 2 Cl2 + 2 Na2CO3 + H2O → Cl2O + 2 NaHCO3 + 2 NaCl2 Cl2 + 2 NaHCO3 → Cl2O + 2 CO2 + 2 NaCl + H2OThis reaction can be performed in the absence of
