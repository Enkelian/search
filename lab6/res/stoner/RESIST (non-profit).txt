RESIST (non-profit)
RESIST is a philanthropic non-profit organization based out of Boston, Massachusetts. It has provided grants to grassroots activist organizations around the country since its inception in 1967 as a result of the anti-war proclamation "A Call to Resist Illegitimate Authority". History RESIST formed in 1967 as an intellectual collective in response to the growing unrest surrounding the Vietnam War. First taking shape in the period leading up to the March on the Pentagon, Robert Barsky describes the collective's formation in Noam Chomsky: A Life of Dissent: in recognition of his friend's long experience with activism, Paul Lauter asked Chomsky ... to team up with him and others to support draft resistance. It was 1966. This was one factor leading to the formation of Resist, which, Chomsky remembers, "'very quickly became involved in other forms of resistance to illegitimate authority" (31 Mar. 1995). One of the activities in which Resist became involved was the March on the Pentagon. In addition to Chomsky and Lauter, others involved in the organization's early stages included novelist Mitchell Goodman, novelist Hans Koning, poet Robert Lowell, writer Dwight Macdonald, leading lawyer for the Mobilization's Legal Defense Committee Ed de Grazia, poet Denise Levertov, and The Armies
