MTV Video Music Award for Best R&B Video
The MTV Video Music Award for Best R&B Video was first awarded in 1993, and was given every year until 2006, as the following year MTV revamped the VMAs and eliminated all of the genre categories. The following year, though, when MTV returned the Video Music Awards to their previous format, Best R&B Video did not return despite four other genre awards doing so. It was only in 2019 that the R&B award returned to the VMAs, now under the shorter name of Best R&B. En Vogue, Destiny's Child, Beyoncé, and Alicia Keys are tied as this award's biggest winners, each having won it twice. Keys is also the category's biggest nominee, receiving her fifth nomination in 2019.
