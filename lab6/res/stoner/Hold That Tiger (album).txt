Hold That Tiger (album)
Hold That Tiger is a live album by American alternative rock band Sonic Youth, recorded at the Cabaret Metro in Chicago on October 14, 1987. It featured songs from the album Sister. It was released on vinyl in 1991, with a CD release in 1998. Apparently, the actual tape of the live recording was sped up to fit vinyl, but was not slowed down again for the CD release. Reception Writing for AllMusic, Brian Flota said, "Sonic Youth is on safe ground here, not indulging themselves in the guitar freakouts that they frequently showcase during their live sets".
