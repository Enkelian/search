History In February 12, 1900, Lincoln's first municipal auditorium, though owned by Lancaster County and operated by the local chapter of the American Legion, opened. The building was burnt to the ground in an accident on April 15, 1928.By 1931, the city of Lincoln was planning to build a new auditorium and name it after General John J. Pershing, based on votes from students that would ultimately form and attend Lincoln Northeast High School. In 1939, city of Lincoln voters approved a $750,000 bond to build a new auditorium. A second bond in 1950, at cost of $1.5 million, was approved, but an additional $75,000 bond was rejected in 1952. Plans for Pershing were approved in 1955 and the building opened two years later.
