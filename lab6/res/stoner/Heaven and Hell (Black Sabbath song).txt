Heaven and Hell (Black Sabbath song)
"Heaven and Hell" is the title track of Black Sabbath's ninth studio album. The music was written mainly by guitarist Tony Iommi, but – as with almost all Sabbath albums – credit is given to the entire band. The lyrics were written entirely by then newcomer Ronnie James Dio.The song has been performed by several bands of which Iommi and Dio were members including Black Sabbath, Dio, and Heaven & Hell. Details Keyboardist Geoff Nicholls, who was a session keyboard player during the recording of the album, is said to have been responsible for this song's bassline. The bassline closely resembles that of "Mainline Riders" by Quartz, of which Nicholls was a former member. Geezer Butler was not available during initial recording of the song in late 1979.Performed live by Black Sabbath, Dio and Heaven & Hell, the song was often stretched out with an extended guitar solo, audience participation, ad-libbed lyrics, or additional lyrics regarding angelic and demonic apparitions and personal judgment. Many later Sabbath lineups included this song in live sets, during which it was variously sung by Ian Gillan, Glenn Hughes, Ray Gillen, and Tony Martin.
