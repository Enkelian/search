It serves as the home stadium and administrative offices for both the New England Patriots of the National Football League (NFL) and the New England Revolution of Major League Soccer (MLS). It was also the home stadium for University of Massachusetts (UMass) Minutemen football in 2012, while on-campus Warren McGuirk Alumni Stadium underwent renovations. It continued to serve as a part-time home venue for higher attendance UMass games through 2018. The stadium was originally known as CMGI Field before the naming rights were bought by Gillette after the "dot-com" bust.
