Forget Her
"Forget Her" is a song by Jeff Buckley. The song was recorded during sessions for Buckley's only completed studio album Grace, but remained officially unreleased until it was featured as the opening track on the bonus disc of Grace: Legacy Edition, a 2004 remastered reissue of the album. The song was subsequently included as a bonus track on several European editions of the standard album. "Forget Her" was subject to much controversy because Buckley specifically chose not to use it for the final release of his debut Grace, opting instead for "So Real". A music video was created for the song, compiled from previously unreleased footage, and was included on the bonus DVD with Grace: Legacy Edition. In Australia, the song was ranked #36 on Triple J's Hottest 100 songs of 2004.
