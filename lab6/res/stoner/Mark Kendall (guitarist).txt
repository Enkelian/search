Mark Kendall (guitarist)
Mark Kendall (born April 29, 1957) is a lead guitarist born in Loma Linda, California. He is best known for being the founding member and lead guitar player of the band Dante Fox, which later became Great White. Early life Mark Kendall grew up in Huntington Beach, California. He came from a musically talented family, with his mother belting out smoky tunes as a jazz singer, his father playing jazz trumpet, and his grandfather, a classically trained pianist from the age of thirteen. As such, Mark developed a good ear for melody early on, and has never lost sight of where his ability came from and the musical gifts he netted through his DNA. He received his first guitar at the age of nine after watching a local band rehearse in a neighbor's garage. His father gave him a Kay acoustic for his birthday and he began to develop a talent to learn songs by ear. The following Christmas his father bought him an electric guitar and amplifier. In addition, his dad also bought him three albums: The Jimi Hendrix Experience's Are You Experienced, Cream's Disraeli Gears, and The Doorsâ€™ Strange Days. These records would prove to be highly influential
