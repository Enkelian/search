Zirconium(IV) chloride
Zirconium(IV) chloride, also known as zirconium tetrachloride, (ZrCl4) is an inorganic compound frequently used as a precursor to other compounds of zirconium. This white high-melting solid hydrolyzes rapidly in humid air. Structure Unlike molecular TiCl4, solid ZrCl4 adopts a polymeric structure wherein each Zr is octahedrally coordinated. This difference in structures is responsible for the disparity in their properties: TiCl4 is distillable, but ZrCl4 is a solid. In the solid state, ZrCl4 adopts a tape-like linear polymeric structure—the same structure adopted by HfCl4. This polymer degrades readily upon treatment with Lewis bases, which cleave the Zr-Cl-Zr linkages. Synthesis This conversion entails treatment of the oxide with carbon as the oxide "getter" and chlorine. ZrO2 + 2 C + 2 Cl2 → ZrCl4 + 2 COA laboratory scale process uses carbon tetrachloride in place of carbon and chlorine: ZrO2 + 2 CCl4 → ZrCl4 + 2 COCl2 Applications Precursor to Zr metal ZrCl4 is an intermediate in the conversion of zirconium minerals to metallic zirconium by the Kroll process. In nature, zirconium minerals invariably exist as oxides (reflected also by the tendency of all zirconium chlorides to hydrolyze). For their conversion to bulk metal, these refractory oxides are first converted to
