Vietnamese nationalism
Vietnamese nationalism (Vietnamese: Chủ nghĩa dân tộc Việt Nam) is the nationalism that asserts that the Vietnamese are a nation and promotes the cultural unity of the Vietnamese. It encompasses a broad range of ideas and sentiments harbored by the Vietnamese people for many centuries in the history to preserve and defend the national identity of the Vietnamese nation. Unlike other South East Asian countries, Vietnam is the most concentrated ethnostate, with ethnic Kinh dominates 87% total population, and Vietnamese is recognized as the only language in the country. Most Vietnamese nationalism focuses on the military history of the country; however, there are also other aspects of the nationalism in Vietnam. However, most of Vietnamese modern nationalist concepts aim mainly on China, which has many times fueled the anti-Chinese sentiment in Vietnam, although there are other anti-Cambodian and anti-French as well, with nothing much significant. History of Vietnamese nationalism During the first states like Au Lac and Nanyue, nationalism among the population was weak. However, following with the later Chinese millennium in Vietnam, several attempts against Chinese occupation resulted with many wars that happened throughout thousand years of Chinese rule, after which Vietnam finally regained independence in the 10th century
