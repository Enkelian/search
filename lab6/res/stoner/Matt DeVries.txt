Matt DeVries
Matthew DeVries (born January 28, 1977) is the former rhythm guitarist in the heavy metal band Chimaira and the former bassist in the metal band Fear Factory. During his time with Chimaira, he, along with Rob Arnold (the lead guitarist) and Mark Hunter (the lead singer) wrote a large number of the band's songs. In 2005, DeVries appeared on the Roadrunner United: The All Star Sessions album, playing on two of the tracks written by Joey Jordison drummer of Slipknot, "Annihilation by the Hands of God" and "Constitution Down". In 2003, DeVries was beaten badly in Liverpool while on tour with Chimaira. The attack was unprovoked and had nothing to do with DeVries' membership of Chimaira or Chimaira's genre of music in general. The band's next two performances, in Dublin< Ireland and Belfast, Northern Ireland were scheduled as normal and the band performed both concerts as a four-piece, while DeVries recovered in hospital. He was then able to join them after that for the rest of the UK/European Tour. It was announced in March 2011 that DeVries would be the touring bassist for Six Feet Under along with fellow Chimaira guitarist Rob Arnold and former Chimaira drummer Kevin Talley. Matt
