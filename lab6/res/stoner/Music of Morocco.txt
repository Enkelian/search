Music of Morocco
Moroccan music is characterized by its great diversity from one region to another, as well as according to different social groups. It includes Arabic music as the chaâbi and the aita of the Atlantic plains (Doukkala-Abda, Chaouia-Ouardigha, Rehamna ...), the melhoune of the Andalusian cities (Meknes, Fes, Salé, Tetouan, Oujda...) as well as the Hassani in the Moroccan Sahara. There is also Amazigh music such as the Rif reggada, the ahidus of the Middle Atlas and the Souss ahwash. Southern Morocco, with its strong Berber population, is the home of the deqqa Marrakshia and of gnawa music. Since the 20th century, musicians have synthesized the Moroccan musical traditions with influences from around the world (blues, rock, metal, reggae, Moroccan rap, etc.). Each genre and musical style is made up of regional subgroups, and is further divided between 'modern' and 'traditional' music.
