The Attic numerals are a symbolic number notation used by the ancient Greeks. They were also known as Herodianic numerals because they were first described in a 2nd-century manuscript by Herodian; or as acrophonic numerals (from acrophony) because the basic symbols derive from the first letters of the (ancient) Greek words that the symbols represented.

Then these parts were written down in sequence, in order of decreasing value.

They are believed to have served as model for the Etruscan number system, although the two were nearly contemporary and the symbols are not obviously related.
