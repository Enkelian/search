Operation Chettyford
During World War II, Operation Chettyford was a tactical deception in support of the 1944 Allied invasion at Anzio. George Patton made a well-publicized visit to units based around Cairo. A number of double agents were used to misinform the Germans that a major invasion of the Balkans was planned.
