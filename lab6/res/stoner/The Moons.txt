The Moons have released three studio albums; "Mindwaves" (2014) and "Fables of History" (2012) on Schnitzel Records Ltd, and the debut Life On Earth on Acid Jazz Records in 2010. History Early days (2006-2007) At the end of 2006, Croft's former band The On Offs broke up. Shortly after this Crofts and Ben Gordelier worked together for the first time, recording bass and drums for former On Offs frontman and friend Danny Connors on one of his projects. As a solo artist, Crofts had built up a collection of demos during The On Offs period, and in 2007 he made a Myspace page (under band name 'The Moons') and uploaded a few songs to gain feedback. Within days Lois Wilson of Mojo magazine had praised Croft's song "Intermission Rag" a (Joe Meek esq instrumental) in Mojo magazine. Crofts decided to form The Moons soon after inviting various musicians such as The On Offs drummer Luke Goddard and friends to play when needed. The Lunar Sessions (2008 - 2009) The first recorded demo was The Lunar Sessions, on which Crofts played all instruments except drums,
