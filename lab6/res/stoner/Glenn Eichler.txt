Glenn Eichler
Glenn Eichler (born c. 1956) is an American comedy writer who started out as an editor for National Lampoon magazine. From there, he moved over to work as story editor for the MTV television shows Beavis and Butt-head and The Maxx. He was later responsible for co-creating and producing the television show Daria, a spinoff from Beavis and Butt-Head, for MTV as well as Hey Joel for VH1. He has also written for such shows as Rugrats, Married... with Children, and The Wrong Coast, a stop-action animation mini-series for the American Movie Classics cable channel. He currently writes for The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on CBS after also writing for Stephen Colbert in Comedy Central's The Colbert Report. Eichler is the author of the humor books Mush!: Sled Dogs with Issues, Stuffed!, Bill and Hillary's Twelve-Step Guide to Recovery (a political satire), and Dr. Katz's Me At a Glance. Because he was executive producer of Daria, he is sometimes claimed to be the creator of the character Daria Morgendorffer; this was actually the work of Beavis and Butt-head writer David Felton, with some input from Mike Judge.
