Kappa Alpha Theta
Kappa Alpha Theta (ΚΑΘ), also known simply as Theta, is an international Greek-letter fraternity for women founded on January 27, 1870, at DePauw University, formerly Indiana Asbury. Kappa Alpha Theta was the first Greek-letter fraternity for women and was founded by four female students (Bettie Locke Hamilton, Alice Allen Brant, Bettie Tipton Lindsey, and Hannah Fitch Shaw). The first women admitted to Phi Beta Kappa were Thetas. The organization currently has 147 chapters at colleges and universities in the United States and Canada. In fact, the organization was the first women's fraternity to establish a chapter in Canada. Theta's total living initiated membership, as of January 23, 2017, was more than 270,000. There are more than 200 alumnae chapters and circles worldwide. Theta's colors are black and gold and the symbol is the kite. The official flower is the gold and black pansy. Across all college campuses, Theta's are known for being leaders in all fields of endeavors, this includes academics, athletics and within the greater community. Kappa Alpha Theta is a member of the National Panhellenic Conference (NPC), an umbrella organization that encompasses 26 social sororities found throughout North America. The organization's own headquarters are located in Indianapolis, Indiana.
