Valencia, Santa Clarita, California
Valencia is a neighborhood in Santa Clarita located within Los Angeles County, California. It is the most populous of the four unincorporated communities (along with Saugus, Newhall, and Canyon Country) that merged to create the city of Santa Clarita in 1987. It is situated centrally in the now-City of Santa Clarita, running from Newhall to the south (below Lyons Avenue) to north of Copper Hill Drive. Valencia was founded as a master-planned community with the first development, Old Orchard I, built on Lyons Avenue behind the Old Orchard Elementary. History In 1769, the Spanish Portola expedition, first Europeans to see inland areas of California, came up and over the pass from the San Fernando Valley and camped near the river on August 8–9. They found a large native village there and witnessed a wedding celebration. Fray Juan Crespi, a Franciscan missionary travelling with the expedition, named the river Santa Clara and noted in his diary that the place would be a good location for a mission. On the return trip, however, the party found a less strenuous trail through Conejo Valley. Later travelers also preferred that route, and Mission San Fernando Rey de España was established down in the valley.The
