Classic Puppets
Classic Puppets is a 2004 compilation CD by American rock band the Meat Puppets. It is composed of material from 1981 to 1989 (as well as a previously unreleased track from the Golden Lies period). Reception In a three out-of five star review, Sean Westergaard of AllMusic remarked that Classic Puppets "does a decent job" anthologizing the band's output with SST Records, but that the compilation "seems almost like an afterthought" and "comes off as a bit lackluster."
