Edwards Stadium
Edwards Stadium (also referred to as Edwards Field) is the track and field and soccer venue for the California Golden Bears, the athletic teams of the University of California, Berkeley. This Art Deco-styled stadium was designed by architects Warren C. Perry and George W. Kelham, and named after Col. George C. Edwards, opening in 1932. It was the oldest track-only stadium in the United States until 1999, when it was reconfigured to accommodate the Cal soccer teams. It is located at 2223 Fulton Street on the southwest corner of the Berkeley campus, at the corner of Bancroft Way, and has a seating capacity of 22,000. From the stadium there are panoramic views of the Berkeley Hills and Strawberry Canyon to the east, and the San Francisco Bay, Golden Gate Bridge, and the San Francisco skyline to the west. Edwards Stadium has hosted eight NCAA championship meets, a National AAU championship, and the 1971 and '78 USA vs. USSR dual meets, among others. There have been 12 world records (including records by Dutch Warmerdam, Jim Ryun, Pat Matzdorf, and Henry Rono), 26 American records and 24 collegiate records set at Edwards. The stadium came under scrutiny for damaged concrete in June
