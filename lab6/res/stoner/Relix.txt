Relix
Relix is a magazine that focuses on live and improvisational music. The magazine was launched in 1974 as a handmade newsletter devoted to connecting people who recorded Grateful Dead concerts. It rapidly expanded into a music magazine covering a wide number of artists. It is the second-longest continuously published music magazine in the United States after Rolling Stone. The magazine is published eight times a year. The magazine has a circulation of 102,000.

He started a newsletter to help his fellow tape-traders connect rather than all of them having to go through him. He and friend Jim McGurn came up with the name Dead Relix because each Dead tape, for them, was a relic. Jerry Moore became the editor-in-chief of Dead Relix, a relatively small magazine dedicated to taping and tape collecting the Grateful and bands
