It's Electric
Diamond Head are an English heavy metal band formed in 1976 in Stourbridge, England. The band is recognised as one of the leading members of the new wave of British heavy metal movement and is acknowledged by thrash metal bands such as Metallica and Megadeth as an important early influence. History Early history Two working class teenagers from Stourbridge created the band in 1976. The band recorded self-financed demo tapes in 1979. Recorded within six hours on a four-track, their unique sound and quality of writing gained enough attention for the band to tour as support to AC/DC and Iron Maiden. Although several record companies expressed interests in signing the band, no contracts were forthcoming. The band was at the time managed by Reg Fellows and Sean Harris' mother (Linda Harris), who reportedly turned down an offer from the influential Leiber/Krebs Management. Thus while other new wave of British heavy metal bands were signed to major labels and headlining their own tours, Diamond Head remained independent. The management decided that they would release their material through a label owned by Muff Murfin called 'Happy Face Records'. Murfin also owned the studio where Diamond Head did many of their early recordings.
