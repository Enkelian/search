Horlick Field
Horlick Field, located on the north side of Racine, Wisconsin, in the United States, is a 5,000-seat football stadium and a baseball park enclosed within stone walls and chain fences. The land for the field was donated by William Horlick, the inventor of malted milk. It was designed in 1907 by Walter Dick, who also designed the North Beach Beach House. Football has been a part of Horlick Field's history since 1919. It was the home for the Horlick - Racine Legion, a member of the NFL from 1922 to 1924, and the Racine Tornadoes, an NFL team in 1926. Now the Racine Raiders, a minor league team in the Mid-States Football League, call Horlick Field their home. Teams from the high schools and local leagues play their regular season games in the baseball diamond, which is the site for local tournaments and championship games. The park has been the home of the Old Timer's Athletic Club Softball Tournament for over three decades. The Racine Belles, immortalized in the film A League of Their Own, called Horlick Field their home while the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League was in existence. Horlick Field has hosted 99 drum and bugle corps shows
