The Disregard of Timekeeping
The Disregard of Timekeeping is the debut album of British hard rock band Bonham, released in 1989. It was produced by Bob Ezrin, who had previously worked with Alice Cooper, Pink Floyd and Kiss; in addition to his usual production duties, he also co-wrote three of the tracks. The album features Trevor Rabin as a guest, who was the lead guitarist and songwriter with Yes from 1982 to 1994. William Ruhlmann of AllMusic stated the record was "palatable, but without the famous name it would be hard to distinguish from the army of other Zep imitators".
