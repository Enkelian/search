Anti-Slavery International is an international non-governmental organisation, registered charity and advocacy group, based in the United Kingdom. Founded in 1839, it is the world's oldest international human rights organisation. It works exclusively against slavery and related abuses.It owes its origins to the radical element of an older Anti-Slavery Society, known as the "Agency Committee of the Society for the Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slavery Throughout the British Dominions", which had substantially achieved abolition of slavery in the British Empire. A successor organisation, the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society, was then created to campaign against the practice of slavery in other countries. In 1990 it was relaunched as "Anti-Slavery International", which works to combat slavery and related abuse.
