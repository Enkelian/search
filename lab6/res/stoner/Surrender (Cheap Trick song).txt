Surrender (Cheap Trick song)
"Surrender" is a single by Cheap Trick released in June 1978 from the album Heaven Tonight. It was the first Cheap Trick single to enter the Billboard Hot 100 chart, peaking at number 62. Its success in Japan, as well as the success of its preceding singles "Clock Strikes Ten" and "I Want You to Want Me", paved the way for Cheap Trick's famous concerts at Nippon Budokan in Tokyo in April 1978 that were recorded for the group's most popular album Cheap Trick at Budokan. The song originates from 1976, as like many other Cheap Trick songs it was played in concert before its release.

In the 2003 film Daddy Day Care, Cheap Trick make an appearance performing the song. The song is part of the soundtrack to the PS2 and Xbox 360 game Guitar Hero 2.
