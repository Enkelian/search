United Baseball League (proposed)
The United Baseball League, also known simply as the United League (UL), was a planned third major league that was formed in 1994, but folded in 1996 without playing a game. Formation First announced on November 1, 1994, the UL founders were Bob Mrazek, a former five-term Congressman from Long Island; John Bryant, a Congressman from Dallas; Richard Moss, a player agent, and Andrew Zimbalist, an economist at Smith College. The UL originally planned to have ten teams, eight in the U.S. and one each in Canada and Mexico. By August 1995, the league introduced former Texas Rangers president Mike Stone as its CEO, and former star Curt Flood as its commissioner. "We need an alternative league," Flood said. "America deserves an alternative league. I wish there was one when I played. Baseball's owners have shut me out for 25 years." Eight franchises were announced, seven in the U.S. and one in Canada.

Co-founder Richard Moss said the plan was for the UL to expand to 16 teams, including Japan and Korea, within three years.Mike Casey,
