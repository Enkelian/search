DADGAD
DADGAD, or Celtic tuning is an alternative guitar tuning most associated with Celtic music, though it has also found use in rock, folk, metal and several other genres. Instead of the standard EADGBE tuning, the six guitar strings are tuned, from low to high, D2 A2 D3 G3 A3 D4. Tuning to DADGAD from standard is accomplished by tuning the first, second and sixth strings down a whole step (two frets). The result is an open D suspended fourth chord (see suspended chord). Being suspended, the open tuning is neither intrinsically major nor minor. History DADGAD was popularised by British folk guitarist Davey Graham. Inspired by hearing an oud player in Morocco, Graham experimented with detuning some of the guitar's strings from standard tuning (E2 A2 D3 G3 B3 E4), arriving at D2 A2 D3 G3 A3 D4 or "DADGAD". He employed the tuning to great effect in his treatments of Celtic music, but also the folk music of India and Morocco. The first guitarists in Irish traditional music to use the tuning were Mícheál Ó Domhnaill and Dáithí Sproule; today it is a very common tuning in the genre. Other proponents of the tuning include Roy Harper, Ben Howard,
