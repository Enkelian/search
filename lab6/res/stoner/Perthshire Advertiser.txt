Perthshire Advertiser
The Perthshire Advertiser is a tabloid newspaper published by Reach plc (formerly Trinity Mirror, also known as Scottish and Universal Newspapers, or Media Scotland, from December 2011) in Perth, Scotland. 'The PA', as it is commonly known has two editions, a Tuesday and Friday. Like all Scottish and Universal/Media Scotland newspapers, The PA used to be printed locally, but in the mid-1990s the printing of all of their Scottish titles was centralised at a new custom-built plant at Blantyre. Editions of its newspapers and guides were transferred to being printed in Merseyside in 2016.
