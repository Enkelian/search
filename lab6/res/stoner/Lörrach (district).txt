Lörrach (district)
Lörrach is a Landkreis (district) in the southwest of Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Neighboring districts are Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald and Waldshut. To the west it borders the French département Haut-Rhin; to the south the Swiss cantons Basel-Stadt, Basel-Landschaft and Aargau. History In 1973 part of the district Müllheim and small parts of the district Säckingen were added to the district, which enlarged the district by about 25% to the current size. Geography The north-east of the district is part of the Hochschwarzwald, the highest part of the Black Forest. In the west is the Markgräfler Hügelland, in the south the Dinkelberg, both lower hilly areas. The Rhine river, which forms most of the district's southern and western border, is in a narrow valley until it spreads north of Basel in the much wider Oberrheinebene. The district is included in the trinational Basel metropolitan area.
