Balboa Stadium
Balboa Stadium is a football and soccer stadium on the West Coast of the United States, located in San Diego, California. Just east of San Diego High School, the original stadium was built 106 years ago in 1914 as part of the 1915 Panama–California Exposition, also in Balboa Park, with a capacity of 15,000. A horseshoe design that opened to the south, it was designed by the Quayle Brothers architectural firm and originally called City Stadium. The capacity was raised to 34,000 in 1961 with an upper deck for the San Diego Chargers of the American Football League (AFL); it was their home field from 1961 through 1966.Due to seismic safety concerns, the stadium was demolished in the 1970s and a smaller venue with a 3,000-seat capacity was built, opening in 1978. Owned by the City of San Diego, it is leased to the San Diego Unified School District, which is responsible for its maintenance. It is currently used for professional soccer and high school events (football, soccer, track, graduation ceremonies, and special events). The stadium has an artificial turf field and lights.
