Learning Resource Centre
Learning Resource Centre (LRC) is a term which is used in the United Kingdom to describe a type of library that exists within an educational setting such as Secondary Schools, Further Education Colleges and Universities. LRC can also stand for Library Resource Centre and in some cases Learning Resource Centre has been shortened to Learning Centre. Learning Resource Centres are similar to a Hybrid library. Overview These centres contain traditional educational resources such as books, journals, software and audio/visual materials, but they also exist to promote electronic information resources. Examples of these are subscription electronic journals, databases, free websites and other web based resources. The traditional Librarian role has been replaced with the LRC Manager who is an Information Professional with qualifications recognised by CILIP. As well as managing the physical environment of the LRC the LRC Manager is usually involved in editing LRC web pages and making contributions to the Virtual Learning Environment, in order to provide access to quality and timely resources to colleagues and students. A key aspect of a Learning Resource centre is the application of self study in a variety of different ways. They usually include computers, places to study and often private rooms. LRCs
