E Line (Expo) (Los Angeles Metro)
The E Line (formerly the Expo Line) is a 15.2 mi (24.5 km) light rail line that runs between Downtown Los Angeles and Santa Monica. The line is named after Exposition Boulevard, which it runs alongside for most of its route. It is one of the six lines in the Metro Rail system, and is operated by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro). The E Line largely follows the right-of-way of the former Pacific Electric Santa Monica Air Line. Passenger service ended in 1953; freight-only service ended by March 1988. Several Expo Line stations are built in the same location as Air Line stations, although no original station structures have been reused.Metro renamed the current Expo Line as E Line (Expo) in late 2019, while retaining its aqua coloring. When the Regional Connector is complete in 2022, the current E Line will be joined with the Eastside portion of the Gold Line to create an extended E Line, which will be colored gold on maps.
