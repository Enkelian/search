Mu opioid receptor
The μ-opioid receptors (MOR) are a class of opioid receptors with a high affinity for enkephalins and beta-endorphin, but a low affinity for dynorphins. They are also referred to as μ(mu)-opioid peptide (MOP) receptors. The prototypical μ-opioid receptor agonist is morphine, the primary psychoactive alkaloid in opium. It is an inhibitory G-protein coupled receptor that activates the Gi alpha subunit, inhibiting adenylate cyclase activity, lowering cAMP levels. Structure A cryo-electron microscopy structure of the µ-opioid receptor–Gi protein complex was published in 2018. Splice variants Three variants of the μ-opioid receptor are well characterized, though RT-PCR has identified up to 10 total splice variants in humans. Location They can exist either presynaptically or postsynaptically depending upon cell types. The μ-opioid receptors exist mostly presynaptically in the periaqueductal gray region, and in the superficial dorsal horn of the spinal cord (specifically the substantia gelatinosa of Rolando). Other areas where they have been located include the external plexiform layer of the olfactory bulb, the nucleus accumbens, in several layers of the cerebral cortex, and in some of the nuclei of the amygdala, as well as the nucleus of the solitary tract. Some MORs are also found in the intestinal tract. Activation of these
