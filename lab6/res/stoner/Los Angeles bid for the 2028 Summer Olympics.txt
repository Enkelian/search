Los Angeles bid for the 2028 Summer Olympics
The Los Angeles bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics and Summer Paralympics was the attempt to bring the Summer Olympic Games to the city of Los Angeles, California in 2024; the games were ultimately awarded to the city for 2028. Following withdrawals by other bidding cities during the 2024 Summer Olympics bidding process that led to just two candidate cities (Los Angeles and Paris), the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced that the 2028 Summer Olympics would be awarded at the same time as 2024. After extended negotiations, Los Angeles agreed to bid for the 2028 Games if certain conditions were met. On July 31, 2017, the IOC announced Los Angeles as the sole candidate for the 2028 games, with $1.8 billion of additional funding to support local sports and the Games program.Los Angeles was chosen by the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) on August 28, 2015, after the Los Angeles City Council voted unanimously to back the bid. Los Angeles was the second city submitted by the USOC for the 2024 Summer Olympics. Boston was originally chosen to be the American bid, but withdrew on July 27, 2015. Los Angeles also originally bid for the USOC's nomination in late 2014,
