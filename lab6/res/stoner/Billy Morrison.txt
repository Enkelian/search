Morrison previously played with Camp Freddy and fronted the hard rock act Circus Diablo. He has also been a member of The Cult, Stimulator, Doheny and Into a Circle.

Early in his career, he was a member of the indie rock band Into a Circle. Consistent abuse of drugs led to a period of inactivity until he recovered and formed Stimulator in 1995. The band signed a recording contract with Geffen Records and recorded an album, but the company never released it. In 2008, Morrison released the album under his own name, stating "When I read about Tunecore, and when the business started to lend itself to home releases – the indie, DIY approach – I wanted to finally release it. All the hard copies sold out, and it still does good business on iTunes. I would call that a success." The Cult
