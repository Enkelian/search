Saturday Night Live (season 28)
The twenty-eighth season of Saturday Night Live, an American sketch comedy series, originally aired in the United States on NBC between October 5, 2002, and May 17, 2003. Cast Before the start of the season, Will Ferrell and Ana Gasteyer left the show. Gasteyer was on maternity leave, and decided not to return, while Ferrell left to star in feature films. Hired to fill their absences were comedian/punk musician Fred Armisen and TV writer Will Forte (of The Groundlings). Both joined the show as featured players. Armisen is the show's second Latino male cast member (Horatio Sanz being first), and also the second male cast member to have some Asian heritage (Rob Schneider being first). Armisen is so far the only cast member to have Korean heritage (though, at the time, Armisen mistakenly believed his heritage to have been Japanese). This would be the final season for Dean Edwards, Chris Kattan and Tracy Morgan. The latter two would make cameo appearances in many episodes of the following season.
