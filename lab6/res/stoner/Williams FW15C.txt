It was raced by Alain Prost and Damon Hill during the 1993 Formula One season. As the car that won both the drivers' and Constructors' Championships in the last season before the FIA banned electronic driver aids, the FW15C (along with its racing predecessor FW14B) is considered to be the most technologically sophisticated Formula One car of all time, incorporating anti-lock brakes, traction control and active suspension.

The original FW15 was an active car from the start which enabled a much tidier package closer to the minimum weight limit. The success of the FW14B meant that the FW15 was not needed in 1992.
