Place of Skulls (band)
Place of Skulls is a doom metal band from Knoxville, Tennessee. Biography Place of Skulls was formed in 2000 by ex-Pentagram guitarist Victor Griffin. Griffin left Pentagram in 1996 and during this time before starting the band, became a Christian. The name is a biblical reference to Golgotha. The band put out their debut album, Nailed, on Southern Lord Records in 2002. Many of these songs deal with Griffin's new found faith in Christianity. Four songs from the Nailed session were explicitly Christian and for this reason did not appear on the album. These were released as the Love Through Blood EP in 2005. Scott "Wino" Weinrich joined the band for their second album, With Vision. This album was released by Southern Lord Records in 2003. Shortly after, Wino left the band to concentrate on The Hidden Hand. In 2006 the band signed to Germany's Exile on Mainstream Records and released the album, The Black Is Never Far. In 2010, the band released their fourth album, As a Dog Returns. The band is currently working on a new album for 2016.
