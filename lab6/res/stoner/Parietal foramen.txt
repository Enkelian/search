Parietal foramen
The parietal foramen is an opening for the parietal emissary vein, which drains into the superior sagittal sinus. Occasionally, a small branch of the occipital artery can also pass through it. It is located at the back part of the parietal bone, close to the upper or sagittal border. It is not always present, and its size varies considerably.
