Carlton Publishing Group
Carlton Publishing Group is a London-based book publisher of illustrated reference, biography, leisure and entertainment books. It publishes books under the imprints of Carlton, Goodman, Goodman Fiell, Andr√© Deutsch, Prion and Carlton Kids. Originally known as Goodman Books after its creator and still-serving publisher and chairman Jonathan Goodman, the company quickly formed business partnerships with leading London media group Carlton Communications to act as the group's publishing arm, and took the name Carlton Books. After some years, Carlton Books closed its formal ties to Carlton Communication, but kept the name. The current name reflects the company's acquisition of several other London-based publishers. Carlton Books is the main imprint of Carlton Publishing Group, specialising in illustrated non-fiction books covering all areas of history, sport, humour & entertainment, puzzles & games, leisure reference and lifestyle.
