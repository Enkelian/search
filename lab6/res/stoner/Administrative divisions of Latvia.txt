Administrative divisions of Latvia
The current administrative division of Latvia is valid since 1 July 2009. According to the Administrative territorial reform of Latvia, Latvia changed its administrative divisions from two-level municipalities (the districts were the first-level municipalities, while towns (cities), town's countryside territories and parishes were the second-level municipalities) to one-level municipalities - districts were abolished, while towns/cities (Latvian: pilsētas, plural), town's countryside territories (Latvian: pilsētu lauku teritorijas, plural) and parishes (Latvian: pagasti, plural) were merged into 110 municipalities (Latvian: novadi, plural), while 9 larger cities got the status of republican cities (Latvian: republikas pilsētas, plural). with their own city council and administration.Municipalities are mainly subdivided into territorial units (novada teritoriālās vienības): municipality parishes (novada pagasti) and municipality towns (novada pilsētas), however, there are municipalities without any subdivision.
