A Retrospective (Lynyrd Skynyrd album)
A Retrospective is a compilation album by American rock group Lynyrd Skynyrd. Reception The Allmusic review by Thom Jurek awarded the album 3 stars stating "As single-disc budget compilations go, this is a solid one so far as it goes. It contains most of the band's biggest hits and only contains two notorious omissions, since "Tuesday's Gone," and "That Smell" aren't here. Other than that, it's got what most casual listeners need of their biggest songs: "Sweet Home Alabama," the nine-minute studio version of "Free Bird," "Saturday Night Special," "You've Got That Right," "Gimme Three Steps," and "What's Your Name?" Of course there have been better comps issued since 1999, but this is OK, and a cheap stopgap."
