Sprig Muslin
Sprig Muslin is a Regency romance novel by Georgette Heyer. The story is set in 1813. Plot summary Sir Gareth is a noted Corinthian and has been a confirmed bachelor ever since his betrothed died prematurely, seven years ago. He decides for practical reasons to marry an old friend, Hester, who is unfashionable and plain, not to mention "on the shelf" at the age of 29. However, he soon meets a young, runaway girl and determines to resolve her problems satisfactorily. Unfortunately, this particular runaway is possessed of an extremely lively imagination, and gets them both into a little more trouble than he had bargained for. The piece is reminiscent of Charity Girl, also about a wiser and more experienced man helping a young girl to find her feet while avoiding becoming romantically entangled with her.
