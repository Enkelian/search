Independent National Radio
Independent National Radio is the official term for the three national commercial radio stations broadcasting on analogue radio in the United Kingdom. The two stations broadcasting on AM were allocated frequencies previously used by BBC Radio 3 (to be used by INR2) and BBC Radio 1 (to be used by INR3). Background The stations came about following the Broadcasting Act 1990 which allowed for the launch of independent national radio (INR) stations in the United Kingdom. The Radio Authority was mandated to award three INR licences. The FM licence (INR1) had to be for a 'non-pop' station and one (INR3) had to be for a predominantly speech-based service. The remaining licence (INR2) was to be open to 'all-comers'. The licences were to be awarded to the highest cash bidder, providing that the applicant met criteria set down in the Broadcasting Act.
