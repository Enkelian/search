Trade (financial instrument)
In finance, a trade is an exchange of a security (stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, derivatives or any valuable financial instrument) for "cash", typically a short-dated promise to pay in the currency of the country where the 'exchange' is located. The price at which a financial instrument is traded, is determined by the supply and demand for that financial instrument. Securities trade life cycleOrder initiation and execution.
