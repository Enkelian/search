FC Rapid București
Fotbal Club Rapid 1923, commonly known as Rapid București (Romanian pronunciation: [raˈpid bukuˈreʃtʲ]) or simply as Rapid, is a Romanian professional football club based in Bucharest. It was founded in 1923 by a group of employees from the Grivița workshops under the name of Asociația Culturală și Sportivă CFR ("CFR Cultural and Sports Association"). Domestically, Rapid București is one of the most successful clubs in Romania, having won 3 Liga I titles, 13 Cupa României and 4 Supercupa României. Internationally, their most notable achievements are reaching the quarter-finals of the 1972–73 Cup Winners' Cup and of the 2005–06 UEFA Cup, and the final of the 1940 Mitropa Cup, which was not played because of the Second World War. In July 2016, the club was declared bankrupt and subsequently replaced in the first division by ACS Poli Timișoara. Several new entities claimed the legacy of Rapid, including ACS Rapid – Frumoșii Nebuni ai Giuleștiului, AFC Rapid and Academia Rapid. In June 2018, after 18 auctions along which the price of the Rapid brand had fallen with about €3 million, Academia officially became the successor of the original club.Since 1939, the club plays its home matches at the Giulești-Valentin Stănescu in burgundy
