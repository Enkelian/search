Canadair CL-415
The Canadair CL-415 (Superscooper, later Bombardier 415) is an amphibious aircraft based on the Canadair CL-215 and designed specifically for aerial firefighting, built by Canadair then Bombardier. Development Introduced in 1966, the 215 was the first aircraft specifically designed to be a water bomber, and 250 were built until 1990. In 1987, following market trends towards more efficient, powerful and reliable turboprop powerplants, Canadair undertook the task of retrofitting 17 CL-215 airframes with the Pratt & Whitney Canada PW123AF engines, providing a 15% power increase over the original piston engines, as well as enhanced reliability and safety. The retrofitted aircraft were designated CL-215T and also featured many aerodynamic and systems improvements including powered flight controls, cockpit air conditioning, as well as upgraded electrical and avionics systems. The most notable external features of the CL-215T retrofit were the aerodynamic additions to the wings and empennage. Based on the success of the CL-215, the company introduced the CL-415, a new-build production series beginning in 1993. The CL-415 first flew on December 6, 1993, with the first deliveries in November 1994. Orders from several countries soon followed. The CL-415 was assembled at the Bombardier Aerospace facility near North Bay/Jack Garland Airport in North
