Levator palpebrae superioris muscle
The levator palpebrae superioris (Latin: elevating muscle of upper eyelid) is the muscle in the orbit that elevates the upper eyelid. Structure The levator palpebrae superioris originates on the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone, just above the optic foramen. It broadens and decreases in thickness (becomes thinner) and becomes the levator aponeurosis. This portion inserts on the skin of the upper eyelid, as well as the superior tarsal plate. It is a skeletal muscle. The superior tarsal muscle, a smooth muscle, is attached to the levator palpebrae superioris, and inserts on the superior tarsal plate as well. The levator palebrae superioris receives its blood supply from the ophthalmic artery. Nerve supply The levator palebrae superioris receives motor supply from the superior division of the oculomotor nerve. Its smooth muscle component, the superior tarsal muscle, is supplied by sympathetic fibers that originate in the cervical spinal cord and travel along the carotid artery. As the carotid arteries pass through the carotid sinuses, the sympathetic fibres travel alongside the oculomotor nerve to supply the superior tarsal muscle. Function The levator palpebrae superioris muscle elevates and retracts the upper eyelid. Clinical significance Damage to this muscle or its innervation can cause ptosis,
