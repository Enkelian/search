Bebe le Strange
Bébé le Strange is the fifth studio album by the American rock band Heart. It was released on February 14, 1980 through Epic Records. It was the first album without founding member Roger Fisher on lead guitar, who had left the band months prior along with his brother Michael. The album was a commercial success, peaking at number five on the U.S. Billboard 200 and staying in the charts for 22 weeks. It also was certified Gold by the RIAA. However it did not sell as well as their previous albums (which had gone Platinum and Multi-Platinum). The record contained the singles "Even It Up" (backed by the Tower of Power horn section) and the title track. Some of the backing vocals were provided by Don Wilhelm, who had been in a group called The Army with Steve Fossen and Roger Fisher in the 1960s. The album was re-released in an expanded edition in 2004, containing two additional songs: a live version of "Break" and the studio outtake "Jackleg Man".
