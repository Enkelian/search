Ivor Novello Award
The Ivor Novello Awards, named after the entertainer Ivor Novello, are awards for songwriting and composing. They have been presented annually in London by the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors (BASCA) since 1956, and over 1,000 statuettes have been awarded. History Nicknamed The Ivors, the awards take place each May and are sponsored by PRS for Music. They are respected worldwide as the major platform for recognising and rewarding Britain and Ireland's songwriting and composing talents. The Ivors remain the only award ceremony in the musical calendar that is not influenced by publishers and record companies, but judged and presented by the writing community. The award itself is a solid bronze sculpture of Euterpe, the muse of lyric poetry.
