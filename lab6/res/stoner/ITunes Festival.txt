ITunes Festival
The Apple Music Festival (formerly known as the iTunes Festival) was a music concert series held by Apple, Inc. inaugurated in 2007. Free tickets were given to Apple Music, iTunes and DICE users who lived in the United Kingdom, through localized prize draws. Performances were streamed live and available to view afterwards, free of charge, for Apple Music members on their Apple TV, iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac, PC, and Android phones. In London, the Apple Music Festival had become an annual music festival which takes place in September at The Roundhouse art centre in Camden Town. The series made its United States debut with five days of free performances at the Moody Theater in March 2014, alongside the South by Southwest (SXSW) music showcase in Austin, Texas. In August 2015, the iTunes Festival was renamed as the Apple Music Festival. After a 10-year run, Apple confirmed to Music Business Worldwide that it will no longer host any music festivals. 2007 Held at the Institute of Contemporary Arts. 2008 Held at KOKO, Camden Town. 2009 Held at The Roundhouse, Camden Town. 2010 Held at The Roundhouse, Camden Town and live streamed on MySpace.com 2011 Held at The Roundhouse, Camden Town
