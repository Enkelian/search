Boris at Last -Feedbacker-
Boris at Last -Feedbacker- (or simply called Feedbacker) is the sixth album by the Japanese experimental music band Boris. The album, a single 43-minute track broken into 5 movements, incorporates many different rock elements. The band frequently revisits the song in concert. On 13 September 2009, as a special set for the Flaming Lips-curated All Tomorrow's Parties New York 2009 in Monticello, Boris performed the album in its entirety. They performed the album again at the Pavement-curated ATP at Minehead Butlin's on 15 May 2010. There is an official DVD released on 2005 and limited to 500 which was released by Diwphalanx Records. This DVD was originally an unofficial recording of the band performing the entirety of "Feedbacker" live in New York and entitled Bootleg -Feedbacker-. The official DVD release depicts a different member of the band lying in a pool of blood similar to Wata on the album cover.
