Five Star Final
Five Star Final is a 1931 American pre-Code drama film about the excesses of tabloid journalism whose premise is best summed up by the line: “I think you can always get people interested in the crucifixion of a woman” and the opening scene, in which thugs vandalize a newsstand whose owner refuses to give the paper preferential placement. The picture was written by Robert Lord and Byron Morgan based on the play of the same name by Louis Weitzenkorn, directed by Mervyn LeRoy, starring Edward G. Robinson, and featuring H. B. Warner, Marian Marsh, Oscar Apfel, Aline MacMahon in her screen debut, Frances Starr, Ona Munson, and Boris Karloff. The title refers to an era when competing newspapers published a series of editions during the day, in this case marking its final edition front page with five stars and the word "Final." "Five Star Final" is also a font similar to those often used in newspaper headlines. Warners remade the film in 1936 as Two Against the World, also known as One Fatal Hour, starring Humphrey Bogart in Robinson's part and set in a radio station instead of a newspaper.The film was nominated at the 5th Annual Academy Awards in
