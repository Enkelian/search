Init Records
Init Records (often stylized as INIT) is an American independent record label founded in January 2001 in Mankato, Minnesota by Steven Williams. In May 2003 the label relocated to Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Since its foundation the label has been solely owned and run by Williams, as a one-man operation, strongly influenced by DIY ethics of punk subculture and with an "emphasis to release aesthetically pleasing records from hardworking bands." An example of DIY ethics that the label applies in its releases is the use of recycled material, such as paper and plastic whenever and wherever possible.
