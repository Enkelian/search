Cobalt(III) chloride
Cobalt(III) chloride or cobaltic chloride is an unstable and elusive compound of cobalt and chlorine with formula CoCl3. In this compound, the cobalt atoms have a formal charge of +3.The compound has been reported to exist in the gas phase at high temperatures, in equilibrium with cobalt(II) chloride and chlorine gas. It has also been found to be stable at very low temperatures, dispersed in a frozen argon matrix.Some articles from the 1920s and 1930s claim the synthesis of bulk amounts of this compound in pure form; however, those results do not seem to have been reproduced, or have been attributed to other substances like the hexachlorocobaltate(III) anion CoCl3−6. Those earlier reports claim that it gives green solutions in anhydrous solvents such as ethanol and diethyl ether, and that it is stable only a very low temperatures (below −60 °C). Structure and properties The infrared spectrum of the compound in frozen argon indicates that the isolated CoCl3 molecule is planar with D3h symmetry.A theoretical study of the stability of this and other metal trihalides at 25 °C was published by Nelson and Sharpe in 1966.Thermodynamic properties for the gas phase have been determined by the Glushko Thermocenter of the Russian
