Hard Rock Hell
Hard Rock Hell is a three day music festival currently held at Vauxhall Holiday resort, Great Yarmouth. It was previously held at Hafan y MÃ´r Holiday Park, Pwllheli, Gwynedd, North Wales, and up until 2011 at Pontin's Holiday Village, Prestatyn, Wales. Holding the festival in a holiday camp gives the organisers pre-built venues and stages and because of the on-site accommodation allows them to hold a multi day festival over winter/spring months when outdoor camping is not desirable. The first edition of the festival was held at Butlins Holiday Camp, Minehead, England but the festival relocated to its current location in 2008. Hard Rock Hell I : The Winter Ball The first edition of the Hard Rock Hell festival was subtitled "The Winter Ball". Held at Butlins Holiday Camp, Minehead, England over Friday 9th and Saturday 10 November 2007. The headliners for the first edition of the festival were Cradle of Filth and Twisted Sister. Hard Rock Hell II : The Dragons Ball The second edition of the Hard Rock Hell festival was subtitled "The Dragons Ball". Held at Pontin's Holiday Village, Prestatyn, Wales over Friday 5th and Saturday 6 December 2008, the headliners for the festival were Thin Lizzy
