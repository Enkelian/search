Cayman Islands
The Cayman Islands ( or ) is an autonomous British Overseas Territory in the western Caribbean Sea. The 264-square-kilometre (102-square-mile) territory comprises the three islands of Grand Cayman, Cayman Brac and Little Cayman, which are located to the south of Cuba and northeast of Honduras, between Jamaica and Mexico's Yucat√°n Peninsula. The capital city is George Town, situated on Grand Cayman, the most populous of the three islands. The Cayman Islands is considered to be part of the geographic Western Caribbean Zone as well as the Greater Antilles. The territory is often considered a major world offshore financial haven for international businesses and many wealthy individuals, and has been placed on the EU's blacklist of foreign tax havens. History No archaeological evidence for an indigenous presence has been found on the Cayman Islands and it is therefore thought that they were discovered by Christopher Columbus on 10 May 1503 on his final voyage to the Americas. He named them 'Las Tortugas' due to the large number of turtles on the islands (which were soon hunted to near-extinction); however, in the succeeding decades the islands began to be referred to as the Caymans, after the caimans present there.
