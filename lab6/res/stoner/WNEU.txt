WNEU
WNEU, virtual channel 60 (UHF digital channel 29), is a Telemundo owned-and-operated television station serving Boston, Massachusetts and Manchester, New Hampshire, United States that is licensed to Merrimack, New Hampshire. Owned by the Telemundo Station Group subsidiary of NBCUniversal (itself a subsidiary of Comcast), it is sister to Nashua, New Hampshire-licensed Class A NBC owned-and-operated station WBTS-CD (channel 15, formerly WYCN-CD), which shares spectrum with Boston-based PBS member station WGBX-TV (channel 44) to provide full-market coverage. WNEU and WBTS-CD, along with co-owned regional cable news channel New England Cable News (NECN) and regional sports network NBC Sports Boston, share studios at the NBCU Boston Media Center on B Street in Needham, Massachusetts, with WNEU's transmitter in the same city, off Cedar Street. Additionally, WNEU maintains a secondary office on Sundial Avenue in Manchester for executive operations and inspection of Federal Communications Commission (FCC) public files. WNEU's Telemundo programming was formerly simulcast by the low-power WYCN-LD (as analog WTMU-LP) as a translator. On January 1, 2017, WYCN-LD (as WBTS-LD) became an owned-and-operated NBC station known as NBC Boston, replacing previous affiliate WHDH (channel 7). In October 2019, WYCN-LD moved its transmitter to Norton, Massachusetts and became the Telemundo station for Providence,
