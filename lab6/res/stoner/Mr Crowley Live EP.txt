Mr Crowley Live EP
Mr. Crowley Live EP is a live EP released by Ozzy Osbourne in 1980. The EP contains live versions of the songs "Mr. Crowley", "Suicide Solution" and "You Said It All", all performed at a 1980 Southampton performance. Overview After performing a show in Birmingham, the band hastily returned to Ridge Farm Studio to remix the song "Goodbye To Romance" for an anticipated single release. The next morning they were informed that Jet Records wanted a new song to release instead as a single. Rhoads, Daisley, and Kerslake quickly put together the song "You Said It All", with drummer Kerslake performing the guide vocal at soundcheck while a drunken Osbourne slept under the drum riser. The plans to release "You Said It All" as a single were later scrapped for unknown reasons; the track was never recorded and the live version featured on Mr. Crowley Live EP is the only known performance of the song.
