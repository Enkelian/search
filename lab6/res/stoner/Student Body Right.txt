Student Body Right
Student Body Right is a simple running play in American football known as a sweep right, in which the tailback runs toward the right end of his offensive line at the snap of the ball and receives a pitch from his quarterback before reaching the line of scrimmage, while his fullback, offensive tackle, and end move from the left side pull to the same side in order to serve as lead blockers for the ball carrier. The inverse play is known as Student Body Left. Origins The origins of the play date to the tenure of John McKay as head coach of the University of Southern California Trojans during the mid-1960s. The popular explanation for the nickname is that in quarters during which USC was headed toward the end zone which contained student seating, the tailback would appear to be running toward the student section at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, where USC played its home games, before cutting upfield.
