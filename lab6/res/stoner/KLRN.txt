KLRN
KLRN, virtual and VHF digital channel 9, is a Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) member television station licensed to San Antonio, Texas, United States. The station is owned by the Alamo Public Telecommunications Council (formerly the Southwest Texas Public Broadcasting Council). KLRN's studios are located on Broadway Street in downtown San Antonio, and its transmitter is located on Foster Road (near Calaveras Lake) in the southeastern part of the city. On cable, the station is available on Charter Spectrum and Grande Communications channel 10, and AT&T U-verse channel 9. KLRN also serves as the default PBS member station for the Laredo and Victoria markets, which do not have one of their own.

Television set manufacturers were not required to equip televisions with UHF
