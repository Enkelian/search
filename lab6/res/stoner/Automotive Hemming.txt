Automotive Hemming
Hemming is a technology used in the automotive industry to join inner and outer closure panels together (hoods, doors, tailgates, etc.). It is the process of bending/folding the flange of the outer panel over the inner one. The accuracy of the operation significantly affects the appearance of the car’s outer surfaces and is therefore a critical factor in the final quality of a finished vehicle. Hemming processes Press hemming Hemming presses are widely used in automotive manufacturing for hemming of sheet-metal body components. The process uses traditional hydraulically operated ‘stamping presses’ to hem closure parts and being the last forming process in stamping, it determines the external quality of automotive outer parts such as doors, hood and trunk-lid. Hemming press features and benefits Die storage systems Fully automatic die-changing systems with parameters that change with each die Pressing capacity typically 60 to 180 tons Large panel size capacity More than one part can be produced on same line Electric hemmers do not need hydraulic oil, are quiet and eco-friendly Hemming press limitations Restricted to flat un-complicated panel profiles High cost Table top hemming Tabletop hemming machines are utilised for the manufacture of medium to high production volumes, with the ability
