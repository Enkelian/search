The Miami Orange Bowl was an outdoor athletic stadium in Miami, Florida from 1937 until 2008. Located in the Little Havana neighborhood west of Downtown, it was considered a landmark, and was the home stadium for the Miami Hurricanes college football team, and the professional Miami Dolphins for their first 21 seasons, until the opening of Joe Robbie Stadium (now Hard Rock Stadium) in nearby Miami Gardens in 1987. The stadium was the temporary home of the FIU Golden Panthers while its FIU Stadium underwent expansion during the 2007 season. Originally known as Burdine Stadium when opened in 1937, it was renamed in 1959 for the Orange Bowl college football bowl game which was played at the venue following every season from 1938 to 1996. The event was moved to Pro Player Stadium (now Hard Rock Stadium) beginning on December 31, 1996. In January 1999, it returned to the Orange Bowl for one final time due to a scheduling conflict. The minor league Miami Marlins baseball team occasionally played games in the Orange Bowl from 1956 to 1960. The stadium was on a large block bounded by Northwest 3rd Street (south), Northwest 16th Avenue (west), Northwest 6th Street (north) and
