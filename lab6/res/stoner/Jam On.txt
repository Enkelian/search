Jam On
Jam On is a jam band radio station on Sirius XM Radio channel 29 and Dish Network channel 6081. It has featured basketball player Bill Walton hosting a Grateful Dead show, hippie icon Wavy Gravy, and pedal steel player Buddy Cage as a DJ. It was formed in 2003 by Sirius VP Joel Salkowitz and programmer Lenny Bloch. The original DJs were Jonathan Schwartz, Stef Scamardo, and Adam Foley. By fall 2010, Sirius XM moved Jam On to channel 81 on the Sirius side to make room for Pearl Jam Radio on channel 17. However, Sirius tuners still list channel 81 under the old Cinemagic name, although from 2009â€“2010, that was The Strobe on Sirius 81. The logo is designed to resemble that of jam band Phish. The internet version can be biased toward "traditional" songs similar to the roots rock style of the Grateful Dead, or to "modern" songs which are more electronically-based and experimental. In June 2019, SiriusXM announced it would be moving JamOn to streaming only to make way for Phish Radio and that listeners could continue to listen to their favorite jam bands for an addition charge for their streaming service online or in the app
