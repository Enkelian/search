Grammy Award for Best R&B Song
The Grammy Award for Best R&B Song (sometimes known as the R&B Songwriter's Award) has been awarded since 1969. From 1969 to 2000, it was known as the Grammy Award for Best Rhythm and Blues Song. The award is given to the songwriter(s) of the winning song, not to the performing artist(s) (except if the songwriter is also the performing artist). Beyonc√© has won it a record four times, while Babyface, Stevie Wonder, Bill Withers and Alicia Keys have three wins each.
