Wild Horses (British band)
Wild Horses were a British rock band, active during the late 1970s and early 1980s. History Wild Horses was formed in the summer of 1978 by ex-Thin Lizzy guitarist Brian Robertson and ex-Rainbow bassist Jimmy Bain. At an early stage, the line-up featured former Stone the Crows and Wings guitarist Jimmy McCulloch and former Small Faces drummer Kenney Jones, but eventually stabilized with the addition of drummer Clive Edwards (ex-Pat Travers, Uli Roth) and guitarist/keyboardist Neil Carter (ex-Wilder, Gilbert O'Sullivan). This line-up recorded the Trevor Rabin-produced eponymous album in 1980, released by EMI who signed the band after their 1979 Reading Festival appearance. Carter left the band in August 1980 after the band's UK tour with Ted Nugent in order to join UFO and later Gary Moore. His replacement was guitarist John Lockton (ex-Next Band, Red Alert) whose first appearance was on the band's Japanese tour in the autumn of 1980 followed by the release of the Stand Your Ground album in the spring of 1981.In June 1981, Robertson and Edwards both left Wild Horses in the wake of the band's Paris Theatre show in London. Robertson teamed up with Mot√∂rhead a year later and recorded Another Perfect Day in
