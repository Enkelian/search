Steve Gibb
Stephen Thadius Crompton Gibb (born 1 December 1973) is an English musician and the first-born son of Barry Gibb and Linda Gibb. As a musician, he has been a member of numerous hard rock and metal bands including 58, Black Label Society, Crowbar, Kingdom of Sorrow, The Underbellys, SkilletHead, Saigon Kick and currently playing guitar as part of Barry Gibb's band. Early life Gibb was born in London, England. At the age of three, Gibb began playing piano, but when he was about thirteen he decided he would like to play guitar. After attending a Van Halen gig he was inspired to work harder at the instrument. Career 1980s On 14 October 1988, Gibb and nine other students at The Lear School in Miami performed their first concert. This group was put together by Isaac Ersoff, a mathematics teacher at the school with a background in music. The students performed at lunchtimes and for special events at the school. Despite the fact that their high school closed in early 1989, Gibb and friends, Mike Wolofsky and Matt Ackerman, maintained their friendship. That same year Gibb and friends formed their own band, which was indecisively christened NNY for No Name Yet.
