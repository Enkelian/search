2005 San Diego Chargers season
The 2005 San Diego Chargers season was the franchise's 36th season in the National Football League, and the 46th overall. The chargers failed to improve on their 12–4 record in 2004, and finished the campaign 9–7 and 3rd overall in their division, missing out on the playoffs for the first time since 2003. Outside linebacker Shawne Merriman was named rookie of the Year at the end of the season. Despite missing the playoffs the Chargers humiliated some of the best teams in the NFL such as the defending Super Bowl champions New England Patriots (41–17) and the previously undefeated Indianapolis Colts (26–17; ending the prospect of a perfect season). Following the season, Drew Brees would sign as a free agent with the New Orleans Saints in what is believed by many as the greatest free agency signing in NFL history.
