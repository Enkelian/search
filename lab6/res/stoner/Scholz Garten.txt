Scholz Garten
Scholz Garten (also known as Scholz Beer Garden) is a beer garden and restaurant in downtown Austin, Texas and the oldest operating business in Texas. Established by German immigrant August Scholz in 1866 after the American Civil War, Scholz Garten became a hub for German immigrants and their culture in the capital city. It was purchased by The Saengerrunde Club in 1914, who still owns it today. It remains a popular gathering spot for both political discussion and University of Texas sports events.Scholz Garten was recorded as a Texas Historic Landmark in 1967, and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. The business lease was purchased in 1986 by Eddie Wilson (founder of the Armadillo World Headquarters and Threadgill's), Phil Vitek, and Michael Osborne who restored it in 1987.
