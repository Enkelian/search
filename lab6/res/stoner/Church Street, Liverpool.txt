Church Street, Liverpool
Church Street is Liverpool's main shopping area, lying between Bold Street to the East and Lord Street to the West. It takes its name from St Peter's, a church consecrated in 1704 and demolished in 1923. To the north of Church Street, the side streets lead to Williamson Square, while to the south, along Church Alley, are the Grade I listed Bluecoat Chambers. Church Alley is the site of the Liverpool Athenaeum Club, an institution founded in the 18th century. The area behind the shops on the south side of Church Street is now part of the Liverpool One shopping, residential and leisure complex, being the redevelopment of a large part of the postcode area L1 - hence the name. Liverpool One opened fully in October 2008. References External links IMDB film from 1897
