Rochester College
Rochester University is a private Christian university in Rochester, Michigan. The college was founded by members of the Churches of Christ in 1959. Rochester University is primarily undergraduate (though it offers some graduate programs, such as the Master of Religious Education) and includes both residential and commuting student populations. The university also offers a degree completion program for adult students. The university is governed by a board of trustees. The Ennis and Nancy Ham Library provides service to students, faculty, staff, and others. History In 1954, members of the Churches of Christ formed a board of trustees to establish an educational institution in the North Central region of the United States. After months of consideration, the board decided to establish a liberal arts college and purchased a country estate in Rochester Hills, Michigan, for a campus site. In September 1959, the college opened as North Central Christian College, retaining that name until 1961. In the years that followed, the institution operated under the name of Michigan Christian College. In 1997, the board adopted the name Rochester College in order to more clearly portray the institution's nature as a liberal arts college in a Christian setting. The campus of Rochester University
