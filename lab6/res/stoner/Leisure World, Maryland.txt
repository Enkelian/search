History Development In 1963, developer Ross Cortese applied for a zoning amendment in order to build a 1,000-acre community of semi-detached homes, townhouses, and apartment buildings south of Norbeck, Maryland. Cortese's company had acquired the option to buy the 1,000 acres of land, formerly known as the Nash tract, for $5,000,000, and Cortese expected it would cost another $750,000 to build the development according to the plans. The development would be restricted to residents who are at least 52 years old. Cortese planned to build clubhouses, a swimming pool, riding stables, an auditorium, a shopping center, medical facilities, a hotel for guests, an 18-hole golf course, and an 8-acre lake at the site. Sixty-five percent of the area would be undeveloped green space. The entire site would be surrounded by a wall, and full-time security guards would restrict access. According to the plans, co-op homes would be available for between $15,000 and
