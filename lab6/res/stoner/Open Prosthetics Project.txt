Open Prosthetics Project
The Open Prosthetics Project (OPP) is an open design effort, dedicated to public domain prosthetics "OP is a forum for collaboration among users, designers and funders with the goal of making our creations available for anyone to use and build upon.

Prosthetic users or other designers can download the Computer-aided design (CAD) data, customize or improve upon the prosthesis, and repost the modifications to the web site. Users are free to take 3D models to a fabricator and have the hardware built for less cost than buying a manufactured limb. The project was started by Jonathon Kuniholm, a Marine reservist who lost part of his right arm to an improvised explosive device (IED) in Iraq.
