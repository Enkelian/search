Michael Moynihan (journalist)
Michael Jenkins Moynihan (born 17 January 1969) is an American musician and journalist. He is best known for co-writing Lords of Chaos, a book about black metal. Moynihan is founder of the music group Blood Axis, the music label Storm Records and publishing company Dominion Press. Moynihan has interviewed numerous musical figures and has published several books, translations, and essays. In the 1990s, Moynihan was frequently characterized as a fascist or neo-fascist by some critics and fans. Moynihan accepted these descriptions with reservations, but in the 2000s dismissed them as inapplicable buzzwords used by "anti-this and anti-that activist types" and denounced the far-right. Biography Moynihan was born in Boston, Massachusetts, to a lawyer father. Moynihan identifies his background as entirely Northern European: Irish, English, Welsh, and German. Moynihan attended Buckingham Browne & Nichols, a private day school in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He became active in experimental music from 1984, forming Blood Axis in 1989 and releasing his first album under that name in 1995. Moynihan collaborated with Boyd Rice from 1989, and in 1990 the two moved into an apartment in Denver. Like Rice and Thomas Thorn, Moynihan was a member of the Church of Satan at this time.
