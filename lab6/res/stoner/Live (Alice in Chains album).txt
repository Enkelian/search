The live version of "Man in the Box" featured in the album was released as a single. Overview Live was the band's only live album other than the acoustic album Unplugged. While most of the songs on Live had been released on previous albums, "Queen of the Rodeo" had not; although, the same live performance had been released on the Music Bank box set. Live includes five songs ("Them Bones", "God Am", "Again", "A Little Bitter" and "Dam That River") from the band's final two shows with vocalist Layne Staley. Reception The album received generally positive reviews from most critics, with Greg Prato of AllMusic writing in his review of the album "Their detuned sound and tales from the darkside are even more sinister and gripping on the concert stage, as evidenced by this 14-track set."
