Dreamer Deceiver
"Dreamer Deceiver" is a power ballad by British heavy metal band Judas Priest, featured on their 1976 studio album Sad Wings of Destiny. Unlike other songs on the album, the song is a "spacy ballad". The song was written by the original singer of Judas Priest, Al Atkins, but he never got to record it with them. He did record it later on one of his solo records, however. The song is known for showing off Rob Halford's full vocal range, starting from soft, quiet singing, to high pitched shrieking. It was performed by the band on the British television programme The Old Grey Whistle Test in 1975. The 2-part medley was released as a single in Japan in 1976 calling the first song "I - Dreamer Deceiver" and the second song "II - Deceiver". The lyrics describe a mystical figure who takes the narrator up through the sky. He ends up "lost above", but is "in peace of mind". He then instructs the listener to try to find a way. The guitar solo is played by Glenn Tipton. This song segues into the next song, "Deceiver", via a long, high pitched scream by Halford. Personnel Rob Halford â€“ lead
