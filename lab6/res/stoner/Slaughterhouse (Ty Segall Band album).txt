Background and recording Regarding the recording process of Slaughterhouse and the role of the Ty Segall Band, Segall noted, "It’s the whole band. The Ty Segall Band. Like Twins, I played almost all of the parts myself. But yeah, we wanted to record a whole record with the band because it was so rad and so fun. It’s cool because we all wrote and played the songs together, it was totally collaborative. It was super fun! [...] I’d like to make five more records with those guys. Hopefully, throughout the years." Track listing Recording Chris Woodhouse recorded the album from February 18 to February 21 at The Hangar in Sacramento, California.
