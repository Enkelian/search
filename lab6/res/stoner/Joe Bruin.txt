Joe Bruin
Joe Bruin is the official mascot of UCLA and is often found with Josephine (Josie) Bruin, a female brown bear. He is a visible and constant on-field presence at UCLA sporting events. History Joe Bruin was created for the UCLA sports team in 1924, when students chose to change the name of the team from "Cubs" to "Grizzlies". In 1926 the name was changed again to "Bruins", which had been used alternately with "Bears" for the UC Berkeley team. UCLA used live bears as mascots, which entertained the home crowd at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The bears were given various names, but "Joe Bruin" endured over time. Costumed student mascots have represented Joe Bruin since the mid-1960s. The design for the costume bear changed again in 1996 from a smiling bruin to the current one. Recognition Joe Bruin has been on the final team for the Capital One Bowl National Mascot of the Year team four times: 2005, 2007, 2008 and 2010. The contest began in 2002.
