New Mission Theater, San Francisco
The New Mission Theater at 2550 Mission St in San Francisco was built in 1916, originally designed by the Reid Brothers. It was renovated for the Nasser Brothers circuit in 1932 by Timothy Pflueger, who transformed it into an Art Deco style masterpiece. It boasts a 70 foot (21 m) marquee sign that is a local landmark. In its early life, it showed mostly "B" movies. In the 1960s and 1970s it specialized in children's fare. The theater closed in 1993 and became a furniture store. It was purchased by the City College of San Francisco, who proposed to raze it and build new campus facilities. But a group called "Save The New Mission Theater", headed by Alfonso Felder, lobbied to stop the College from destroying the theater.The theater was renovated by the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema chain, and opened in December 2015. == References ==
