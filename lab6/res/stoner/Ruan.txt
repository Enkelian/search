Ruan
The ruan (Chinese: 阮; pinyin: ruǎn) is a traditional Chinese plucked string instrument. It is a lute with a fretted neck, a circular body, and four strings. Its four strings were formerly made of silk but since the 20th century they have been made of steel (flatwound for the lower strings). The modern ruan has 24 frets with 12 semitones on each string, which has greatly expanded its range from a previous 13 frets. The frets are commonly made of ivory or in recent times of metal mounted on wood. The metal frets produce a brighter tone as compared to the ivory frets. It is sometimes called ruanqin, particularly in Taiwan. Sizes The ruan comes in a family of five sizes: soprano: gaoyinruan (高音阮, lit. "high pitched ruan"; tuning: G3-D4-G4-D5) alto: xiaoruan (小阮, lit. "small ruan"; tuning: D3-A3-D4-A4) tenor: zhongruan (中阮, lit. "medium ruan"; tuning: G2-D3-G3-D4) bass: daruan (大阮, lit. "large ruan"; tuning: D2-A2-D3-A3) contrabass: diyinruan (低音阮, lit. "low pitched ruan"; tuning: G1-D2-G2-D3)The ruan is now most commonly used in Chinese opera and the Chinese orchestra, where it belongs to the plucked string (弹拨乐 or chordophone) section.
