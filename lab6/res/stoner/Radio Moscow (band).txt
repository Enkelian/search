After completing an album's worth of material, Griggs enlisted bassist Serana Andersen to form Radio Moscow, and the duo relocated to Colorado. Following a show, Griggs got a demo into the hands of The Black Keys frontman Dan Auerbach, who then helped in getting Radio Moscow signed to Alive Naturalsound Records. During this time, Parker recorded the contents of 3 & 3 Quarters which was eventually released in 2012 under Radio Moscow. The album is predominantly Garage Rock, with all instruments handled by Griggs. Radio Moscow Upon returning to Iowa, Luke McDuff was brought in as the new bassist of the group. They recorded the band's debut album in 2006, with Auerbach handling production duties; Radio Moscow was released in February 2007. Shortly after the release of the album, McDuff was replaced by Zach Anderson. Brain
