Chin
The human chin (also known as the mental protuberance, mental eminence and, rarely, mental osseum, tuber symphyseos) refers to the forward pointed part of the anterior mandible (mental region) below the lower lip. A fully developed human skull has a chin of between 0.7 cm and 1.1 cm. While some more obese people may appear to have a “double chin”, this is only a facial feature of the neck where multiple layers of skin build up. Evolution The presence of a well-developed chin is considered to be one of the morphological characteristics of Homo sapiens that differentiates them from other human ancestors such as the closely related Neanderthals. Early human ancestors have varied symphysial morphology, but none of them have a well-developed chin. Why modern humans have this particular feature and why it is not present in any fossil or living primate remain tantalizing questions. The origin of the chin is traditionally associated with the anterior–posterior breadth shortening of the dental arch or tooth row; however, its general mechanical or functional advantage during feeding, developmental origin, and link with human speech, physiology, and social influence are highly debated. Functional perspectives Robinson (1913) suggests that the demand to resist masticatory stresses
