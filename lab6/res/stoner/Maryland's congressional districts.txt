Maryland's congressional districts
Maryland is divided into eight congressional districts, each represented by a member of the United States House of Representatives. After the 2010 Census, the number of Maryland's seats remained unchanged, giving evidence of stable population growth relative to the United States at large. Maryland is considered to be one of the most gerrymandered states in the country.
