Monarchy of the North
The Monarchy of the North (Portuguese: Monarquia do Norte), officially the Kingdom of Portugal (Portuguese: Reino de Portugal), was a short-lived revolution and monarchist government that occurred in the North of Portugal, in early 1919. The movement, also known as the Kingdom of Traulitânia (Portuguese: Reino da Traulitânia), based in Porto, lasted from 19 January to 13 February 1919. The movement was led by Henrique Mitchell de Paiva Couceiro, a prominent member of the Portuguese imperial government, without any sanction from the deposed King of Portugal, Manuel II. Paiva Couceiro, who had led and participated in many previous attempts at restoring the Portuguese monarchy, stated that the revolution was necessary because "if the North does not agree with the South, I will be, until the end, on the side of the faithful to tradition". The revolution's inability to gain strong popular support throughout the country, coupled with its unorganized structure, led to its quick demise and the re-establishment of the Portuguese republican regime in the north. Background The North of Portugal has often been the historical setting for revolutions and revolts against the position of the Portuguese government, from the Liberal Revolution of 1820, which went against the absolutist government,
