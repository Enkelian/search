Uncut Gems (soundtrack)
Uncut Gems is a soundtrack album by electronic musician Daniel Lopatin, containing the original score for the Safdie brothers' 2019 film Uncut Gems. It was released via Warp on December 13, 2019. It received positive reviews from critics. It peaked at number 44 on the UK Soundtrack Albums Chart. Background Film co-director Josh Safdie worked closely with Lopatin on the score, which began with a "Frankenstein" score using library and new-age music before Lopatin began sketching out compositions. Safdie described the soundtrack as "a medicinal new-age soul of a film," in contrast to the "pulse" of their previous collaboration Good Time. Lopatin described it as "more beautiful, ethereal, it's more orchestral, itâ€™s goofier."The "cosmically synthesized" score uses a Moog One synthesizer, and draws inspiration from artists such as Isao Tomita, Tangerine Dream and Vangelis, as well as the 1970s-80s new-age duo Emerald Web. Lopatin and Safdie used Moog's synthesizer library and Omnisphere to search for "earthy melancholic sounds that had a cosmic twist," as well as saxophone and a choir. The track "Fuck You, Howard" is a reinterpretation of Haydn's Symphony No. 88, while "Windows" is a homage to "Kaneda's theme" from the anime film Akira Critical reception At Metacritic,
