Friedrich Wilderness Park
Friedrich Wilderness Park lies at the southern end of the Texas Hill Country. The park is hilly due to its location on the Balcones escarpment that separates the Texas Hill Country from the flat South Texas region.

The park was developed with monies from Ms Ward and a grant from the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. The park opened in 1978. Notable features Endangered bird One endangered bird, the golden-cheeked warbler spends summer in the park.
