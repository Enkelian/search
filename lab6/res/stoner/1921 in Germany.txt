1921 in Germany
Events in the year 1921 in Germany. Incumbents National level President Friedrich Ebert (Social Democrats)Chancellor Constantin Fehrenbach (Centre) to 4 May, then from 10 May Joseph Wirth (Centre) Overview The year 1921, like every year between World War I and Adolf Hitler's rise to power, was for Germany one of gloom, redeemed only by a few bright spots. Political life had not yet recovered from the shock caused by the overthrow of a form of government deeply rooted in the history of the people. The newly empowered Reichstag was prey to wild party strife, which made the formation of a stable government difficult. The political troubles in addition to the continuing economic strife caused by the Treaty of Versailles's economic provisions (especially war reparations) caused a fatigue in the German psyche. However, in spite of assaults, both from within and from without, the Weimar Republic survived despite its many troubles. Almost all of the most important events in Germany in 1921 were connected with questions arising out of the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, disarmament, reparations, trials of war criminals, and the plebiscite in Upper Silesiaâ€”questions that, from their harassing nature, kept both government and people in constant suspense
