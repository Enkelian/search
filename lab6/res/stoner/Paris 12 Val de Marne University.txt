Paris 12 Val de Marne University
Paris-Est Créteil University (French: Université Paris-Est Créteil, UPEC, previously Université Paris XII Val de Marne or simply Paris XII) was inaugurated in 1970. It is a multidisciplinary centre based principally in Créteil (Val-de-Marne). The university offers training in law, arts and humanities, sciences and technology, economics and development, administration and exchange, educational science, as well as social sciences. Val de Marne University is composed of seven departements and seven institutes situated in Créteil (Val-de-Marne), Seine-et-Marne, and in the 14th arrondissement of Paris. History Following the division of the second oldest academic institution, the University of Paris, into thirteen autonomous universities, Val de Marne University was created on March 21, 1970. The CHU Henri-Mondor facility for the medical school was the first to be built in 1969, shortly before the law and business schools hosted in La Varenne-Saint-Hilaire. In 1970 the university expanded through the construction of the Créteil centre. Further major expansions occurred in 1988, when the Technological centre was created in Sénart and Fontainebleau, and 2005, when the law school was relocated from Saint-Maur to Créteil.
