Charles Buckeridge
Charles Buckeridge (circa 1832–73) was a British Gothic Revival architect who trained as a pupil of Sir George Gilbert Scott. He practised in Oxford 1856–68 and in London from 1869. He was made an Associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1861. Family Charles was born in France, the son of Charles Elliott Buckeridge and his wife Eliza, the daughter of John Eyre of Reading, Berkshire. He grew up in Salisbury in Wiltshire. He was married and raised three sons and three daughters in Oxford, including John Hingeston Buckeridge, who was a church architect, and Charles Edgar Buckeridge (1864 - 1898), who painted church interiors. Charles was brother-in-law of the botanist Giles Munby. Work Much of Buckeridge's work was for parish churches and other institutions of the Church of England. Dates that Sherwood and Pevsner cite for work at Charlbury and Emmington suggest that these works, like that at Bletchingdon, were completed posthumously.
