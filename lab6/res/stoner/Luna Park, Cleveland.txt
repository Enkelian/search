Luna Park, Cleveland
Luna Park was a trolley park (a type of amusement park) in Cleveland, Ohio, USA, from 1905 to 1929. Specifications Constructed by Frederick Ingersoll, the park occupied a hilly 35-acre (140,000 m2) site bounded by Woodland Avenue, Woodhill, Mt. Carmel, and East 110th Street and included roller coasters, carousels, a fun house, a Ferris wheel, a roller rink, a shoot-the-chutes ride, a concert shell, a dance hall, bumper cars, a baseball field, and a 20,000-seat stadium (unofficially called "Luna Bowl", destroyed by fire in 1929) in which American football was played. On May 18, 1905, Cleveland's Luna Park became the second Ingersoll park of that name (out of 44) to have opened before his death in 1927, and the second amusement park (after Luna Park, Pittsburgh, which opened weeks earlier) to be covered with electrical lighting. History The monetary demands of upgrading and maintaining his embryonic chain of amusement parks forced Ingersoll, the original owner of Cleveland's Luna Park, to declare bankruptcy in 1908; Ingersoll was forced to sell his Cleveland park to Matthew Bramley, an original investor in (and, later, owner of) Ingersoll's Luna Park Amusement Company who built the Cleveland Trinidad Paving Company into the largest paving company
