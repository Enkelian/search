They used ideographic or early mnemonic symbols or both to represent a limited number of concepts, in contrast to true writing systems, which record the language of the writer.

According to some archaeologists, the symbols carved on the shells had similarities to the late 2nd millennium BC oracle bone script. Others have dismissed this claim as insufficiently substantiated, claiming that simple geometric designs such as those found on the Jiahu shells cannot be linked to early writing. Neolithic Europe Paleoanthropologist Genevieve von Petzinger, characterized 32 symbol types found in ice age European cave paintings and carved objects dating back to 40,000 years ago, determining that they were a system of probably ideographic symbols that may have predated human arrival in Europe.The Vinƒça symbols (6th to 5th millennia BC, present-day Serbia) are an evolution of simple symbols beginning in the 7th millennium BC, gradually increasing
