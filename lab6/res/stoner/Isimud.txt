Isimud
Isimud (also Isinu; Usm√ª; Usumu (Akkadian)) is a minor god, the messenger of the god Enki, in Sumerian mythology.In ancient Sumerian artwork, Isimud is easily identifiable because he is always depicted with two faces facing in opposite directions in a way that is similar to the ancient Roman god Janus. Mythology Isimud appears in the legend of Inanna and Enki, in which he is the one who greets Inanna upon her arrival to the E-Abzu temple in Eridu. He also is the one who informs Enki that the mes have been stolen. In the myth, Isimud also serves as a messenger, telling Inanna to return the mes to Enki or face the consequences. Isimud plays a similar role to Ninshubur, Inanna's sukkal. Isimud also appears in the myth of Enki and Ninhursag, in which he acts as Enki's messenger and emissary.
