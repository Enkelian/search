Viola profunda
The viola profonda is a bowed string instrument in tenor-range, with four strings, which is bigger than a viola and its standard way of playing is resting on the shoulder (as a violin and viola). By having its own sound colour and by filling the entire tenor-range, it reforms the usual classical string quartet and completes the idea of classical music theory of having four separate voices with their own timbre each (soprano, alto, tenor, bass) in every instrument-category; as known in the choir, the woodwinds and the brass family, whereas in the usual string quartet the tenor range is distributed between the viola and the cello. Tuning Its pitch is one octave below the violin and the strings are tuned as G2, D3, A3, E4. The notation is either in G-clef (sounds one octave lower than written); or in C-clef (sounds one fourth lower than written). History The viola profonda was invented by the Bolivian composer, director and instrument-developer Gerardo Ya√±ez; the unique specimen was patented in 2007. It has been presented officially the first time on November 2, 2008 at the St. Thomas Church, Leipzig-Germany and on January 14, 2010 at the Berliner Philharmonie.
