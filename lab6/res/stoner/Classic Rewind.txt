Classic Rewind
Classic Rewind is a classic rock radio station on Sirius XM Radio, which centers on the Mid to late 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s, picking up musically where Classic Vinyl ends. It is heard on channel 25 on Sirius XM Radio. It can also be heard on Dish Network channel 6025. The channel is often billed as classic rock from the cassette era, from where the channel's title is derived. The music itself is played clearly from digital sources, but the DJ's voice is intentionally distorted for effect, made to sound like a bad FM broadcast, or crackling audio cassette. The channel merged with XM's Big Tracks on November 12, 2008, following the merger of Sirius and XM. Artists played Tom Petty Van Halen Aerosmith The Cars Boston The Police Journey Genesis John Mellencamp AC/DC Bruce Springsteen Queen Guns N' Roses Def Leppard U2 Z.Z.
