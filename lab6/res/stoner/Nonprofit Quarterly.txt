Nonprofit Quarterly
The Nonprofit Quarterly, also known as NPQ, is a nonprofit magazine publication which provides research-based articles and resources to educate the nonprofit sector. The publication focuses on management, fundraising practices, philanthropy, and governance/board management. The Quarterly was originally founded, published and edited by David Garvey in 1994, as the New England Nonprofit Quarterly, as a regional learning magazine for New England nonprofit practitioners. The Nonprofit Quarterly launched as a national print journal in the winter of 1999, and now also publishes daily content online. The current editor-in-chief of NPQ is Ruth McCambridge, who led the transition of the Quarterly to its national format. Sources: == References ==
