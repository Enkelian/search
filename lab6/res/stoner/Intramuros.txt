Intramuros
Intramuros (Latin for "within the walls") is the 0.67 square kilometres (0.26 sq mi) historic walled area within the modern city of Manila, the capital of the Philippines. It is administered by the Intramuros Administration (IA) with the help of the Local Government of Manila. IA was created through the Presidential Decree No. 1616 signed on April 10, 1979. IA is tasked to rebuild, redevelop, administer and preserve the remaining pre-war buildings, structures and fortifications of Intramuros. Intramuros is also called the Walled City, and at the time of the Spanish Empire was synonymous with the City of Manila. Other towns and arrabales (suburbs) located beyond the walls are referred to as "extramuros", Latin for "outside the walls". It was the seat of government and political power when the Philippines was a component realm of the Spanish Empire. It was also the center of religion, education and economy. The standard way of life in Intramuros became the standard way of life throughout the Philippines. The Manila galleons, which sailed the Pacific for 250 years, carried goods to and from Intramuros (Manila) and Acapulco, Mexico. Construction of the Citadel was started by the Spanish imperial government in the late 16th century
