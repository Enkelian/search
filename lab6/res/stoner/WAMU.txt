History WAMU began as an AM carrier-current student radio station, signing on July 28, 1951 on 610 kHz.

The university received an FM license in late 1960, and made its first FM broadcast on October 23, 1961, at 88.5 MHz.Although it was not strictly necessary since the AM station's call sign was not official, the FM station took the suffixed call sign WAMU-FM to differentiate itself. It dropped the -FM suffix in 1981. The student radio station continued operating and was renamed WVAU in 1985; it transitioned from carrier-current to cable FM in 1988, and later became internet-only in 2001.From its inception, WAMU has provided public affairs and educational programming.
