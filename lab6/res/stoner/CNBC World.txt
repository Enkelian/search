CNBC World
CNBC World is an American pay television business news channel operated by NBCUniversal which provides coverage of world markets alongside the domestic CNBC service, using programmes from CNBC's international networks based in Europe, Asia, India, and other regions served by a domestic CNBC channel or affiliate. Effectively, this makes the network's prime time timeslot the graveyard slot, due to timezone differences, when it simulcasts live programming from their overseas sister networks. During U.S. trading hours covered by the main CNBC network, several other pre-taped shows from CNBC's different international channels (e.g. CNBC-TV18) are also seen on the channel, along with CNBC Prime reality programming such as American Greed and other CNBC specials are shown, in order to force viewers to tune in to the main CNBC service for business information outside the Eurasian market days. As of 2017, the network is not offered in high definition and the only way to watch CNBC's international networks in that format in the United States is through the premium monthly/yearly streaming service, "CNBC Pro." Before 2001, CNBC Asia's coverage was seen on American cable via the International Channel, both before and after that network's merger with Asia Business News. Programming Asia Squawk Box
