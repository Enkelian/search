Bruce Haack
Bruce Clinton Haack listen (May 4, 1931 â€“ September 26, 1988) was a Canadian musician and composer, and a pioneer within the realm of electronic music. Biography From Alberta to New York (1931-1963) Demonstrating an early ability for music, Bruce Haack is said to have started picking out melodies on his family's piano at age four, and progressing to providing piano lessons for others by age 12. While attending college in Edmonton, Canada, at the University of Alberta, Haack began performing in local venues with a then-popular local band called The Swing Tones. While the band played primarily modern and old-time music, they also performed Ukrainian Folk music, which introduced Haack to Eastern musical motifs and themes. This exposure would prove to have a significant influence on Haack's work later in life. Prior to leaving Alberta to move to New York City, Haack assembled a large record collection of music from many parts of the world. In later years, Haack's painting of St. Basil is said to be reminiscent of his earlier years with The Swing Tones in Edmonton. Bruce Haack is remembered at this time in his development as having a surprising ability to hear music and play it
