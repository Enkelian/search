The following is a list of recurring Saturday Night Live characters and sketches introduced between September 26, 1998, and May 15, 1999, the twenty-fourth season of SNL. Hello Dolly An Ana Gasteyer sketch. Debuted October 3, 1998. The How Do You Say? Ah, Yes, Show This sketch was furnished as a talk show featuring Chris Kattan as Antonio Banderas, the show's host. Kattan portrayed Banderas as a naïve chauvinist whose only objective was to seduce every female guest into sleeping with him, using his well-documented sex appeal and shaky-at-best mastery of the English language (as evidenced in the show's title). In the show, Banderas was always backed up by his three-man mariachi band, who aside from performing the musical duties on the show, constantly begged Banderas not to unbutton or remove his shirt, for it would be "too sexy". Guest host Jennifer Love Hewitt, who was put off by his advances, questioned his amorous behaviour by asking "Aren't you married to Melanie Griffith?" His response was "Si. I am betrothed to her. She is, eh, how do you say? Ah, yes, old and not here." Drew Barrymore did appear in a sketch as Melanie Griffith. Debuted October 17, 1998. Dog
