Martinair
Martinair, legally Martinair Holland N.V., is a Dutch cargo airline headquartered and based at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol and a subsidiary of Air France-KLM. The airline was founded in 1958 by Martin Schröder. Since 2011, Martinair has operated entirely as a cargo airline with scheduled services to 20 destinations worldwide and additional charter flights. Prior to that date, passenger flights were also operated. History Early years The airline was founded on 24 May 1958 as Martin's Air Charter (MAC), by Martin Schröder and John Block, with one aircraft, a de Havilland Dove, and five employees. In 1963 Mr. Schröder sold 49% of the company to four equal shipping company shareholders (12.25% each, these eventually combining as Nedlloyd). KLM would later purchase the 50+% that Mr. Schröder owned, buying him out. The name was changed to Martinair Holland in 1966. A healthy boost came in 1967 with the opening of business to the United States. Martinair became all jet-powered in 1971.In 1991, the first aircraft with the Martinair Cargo name was introduced, and Holland was dropped from all aircraft. In 1996, Martinair bought a 40% stake in Colombian cargo carrier TAMPA Cargo, based in Medellín, which it increased to 58% in 2003.
