Powder and Patch is a novel written by Georgette Heyer. It was originally titled The Transformation of Philip Jettan when published by Mills and Boon in 1923. In 1930, the book was republished by William Heinemann minus the original last chapter as Powder and Patch. Plot summary Philip Jettan, a handsome and sturdy but tongue-tied youth, is rejected by his true love because he is not foppish enough. He resolves to improve himself and travels to Paris, where he becomes a sensation. Once he returns, however, Cleone realizes she wants the old Philip in place of the "painted puppy" she has received.
