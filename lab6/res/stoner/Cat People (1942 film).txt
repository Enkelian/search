Cat People (1942 film)
Cat People is a 1942 American horror film directed by Jacques Tourneur, produced by Val Lewton, and starring Simone Simon, Kent Smith, Jane Randolph and Tom Conway. The plot focuses on a Serbian fashion illustrator in New York City who believes herself to be descended from a race of people who shape shift into panthers when sexually aroused or angered. DeWitt Bodeen wrote the original screenplay, which was based on Lewton's short story The Bagheeta, published in 1930. Shot in Los Angeles, Cat People premiered in New York City on December 5, 1942, and was given a wide theatrical release on Christmas Day. The film was a moderate critical and commercial success at the time of its release. It was followed by one sequel, The Curse of the Cat People (1944). In the intervening years, Cat People was subject of critical reappraisal, and noted for its visual influence, particularly the work of cinematographer Nicholas Musuraca. In 1993, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant." The film was later acquired by The Criterion Collection and released on Blu-ray in 2016. Plot At the
