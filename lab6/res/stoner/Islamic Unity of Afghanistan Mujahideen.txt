The alliance sought to function as a united diplomatic front towards the world opinion, and sought representation in the United Nations and Organisation of the Islamic Conference.The constituents of the Peshawar Seven alliance fell into two categories, the political Islamists: Hezb-e Islami Khalis (Khalis), Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin (Hekmatyar), Jamiat-e Islami (Rabbani), and Ittehad-e Islami (Sayyaf), and the traditionalists: Mahaz-e Milli (Gailani), Afghanistan National Liberation Front (Mojaddedi), and Revolutionary Islamic Movement (Mohammadi).
