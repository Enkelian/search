1997 St. Louis Rams season
The 1997 St. Louis Rams season was the team's 60th year with the National Football League (NFL) and the third season in St. Louis. Still struggling to find answers, the Rams looked to improve on their 6–10 record from 1996 and make the playoffs for the first time since 1989, when the team was still based in Anaheim. The Rams started out the season mediocre, splitting their first four games. However, after beating the Giants at home, things began to unravel, as the Rams lost their next eight games before winning three of their last four to end the season 5–11. This was Dick Vermeil’s first season as head coach of the Rams.
