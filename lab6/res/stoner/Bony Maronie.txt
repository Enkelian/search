Since then the song has been covered many times. Hush version In April 1975, Australian glam rock band Hush released a version, which peaked at number 4. The band performed the song on Countdown. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane said that "One of the defining moments of Australia's 1970s pop legacy was undoubtably Hush performing "Boney Moroney" (on Countdown)" He described how "Keith Lamb wiggled his satin flares-encased bum, thrust out his crotch and leered at the camera with a mischievous look in his eyes (and all the little girls understood). Les Gock dashed around the set in stack-heeled boots and glam threads, with peroxided streaks in his flowing, jet-black hair. Rick Lum hammed it up in a serious kind of way. Chris Pailthorpe cheerfully revealed his goofy, gap-toothed grin whenever the camera panned across his face."The song was the first single from the albums fourth studio album, Rough Tough 'n' Ready.
