Cold Case Hammarskjöld
Cold Case Hammarskjöld is a documentary film by Danish film maker Mads Brügger. It depicts the death of Dag Hammarskjöld in a plane crash in 1961 and proposes a theory that a white supremacist organization attempted to spread HIV/AIDS among black Africans. The film investigates the possibility that Hammarskjöld's plane, which crashed in Northern Rhodesia, was shot down by Belgian-British mercenary pilot Jan van Risseghem. After unsuccessful attempts to conclusively prove that theory, the film veers off to investigate the mysterious mercenary organization SAIMR, managing to contact two new witnesses that claim to have been involved with the organization. Parts of the movie are meta-cinematic, reflecting upon theatrical methods used (role playing, dressing up and employment of two African secretaries) and the true motivations of the filmmaker. Synopsis Mads Brügger teams up with Göran Björkdahl, who received from his father a metal plate believed to be a part from the Albertina, Hammarskjöld's Douglas DC-6B aircraft. They develop and investigate the theory that a small jet aircraft opened fire on the Albertina near Ndola and brought it down, possibly after an attempt to detonate a bomb after take-off had failed in Lubumbashi. Their revelations trigger a new investigation into Hammarskjöld's death;
