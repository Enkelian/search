The Born Free Tour
The Born Free Tour is the second headlining concert tour by English stage actress and singer Kerry Ellis with Brian May. The original 2012 tour comprised 11 dates in and around the home counties of England, beginning on 5 November 2012 at the Apex in Bury St Edmunds, and finishing at the Swan Theatre in High Wycombe. A second leg will tour further venues in England, and also visit Ireland and Wales. It will begin on 17 June 2013 at St John Evangelist Church, Oxford, and finish at the Dublin Olympia on 30 June 2013. A third leg will see Ellis and May taking The Born Free Tour to mainland Europe, for one date in France, one in Austria and four in Italy in July 2013.

Receiving positive reviews, the tour was complimented by critics for the pairing of May's sound and Ellis' vocals. Ellis and May released a live album from the first leg of The Born Free Tour, Acoustic by
