Oesterreichische Nationalbank
The Oesterreichische Nationalbank (OeNB) is the central bank of Austria and, as such, an integral part of both the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) and the Eurozone. In the public interest, the Oesterreichische Nationalbank contributes to monetary and economic policy decision-making in Austria and in the Euro area. In line with the Federal Act on the Oesterreichische Nationalbank, the OeNB is a stock corporation. Given its status as a central bank, it is, however, governed by a number of special provisions, as laid down in the Nationalbank Act. The OeNB's capital totals EUR 12 million and is held by a sole shareholder, the federal government. The shareholder rights of the federal government are exercised by the Minister of Finance. Since May 2010 this capital is entirely held by the Austrian state. Previously half of the capital was in the hands of employer and employee organizations as well as banks and insurance corporations. History The Oesterreichische Nationalbank was founded in 1816 by Francis I, the first Emperor of Austria. The bank was founded after a period of high currency devaluation in Austria during war times, when paper money was issued by the Habsburg state. Tasks and composition The main tasks
