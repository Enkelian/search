Eurockéennes
Les Eurockéennes de Belfort (French pronunciation: ​[lez‿øʁɔkeɛn də bɛlfɔʁ], English: The Eurockeans from Belfort) is one of France's largest rock music festivals. The Eurockéennes, a play on words involving rock and européennes (Europeans), is a festival based in a nature reserve beside Lac de Malsaucy Belfort. About History 1989 marked the first time round for the festival, when it went under the name Le Ballon - Territoire de musiques, named after the nearby Ballon d'Alsace. The festival was organised to take place on the Ballon d'Alsace, but the peninsula on the Malsaucy lake was chosen in the end, because it was easier to link by car, bus and even train. It was the brainchild of the Conseil général of the Territoire de Belfort, who wanted to dynamise their département with a big cultural event for its youths. In 1990 the festival was renamed les Eurockéennes de Belfort.
