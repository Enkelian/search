Under Cover
Under Cover is the ninth studio album by British heavy metal vocalist Ozzy Osbourne. The album consists entirely of cover songs, with an emphasis on hard rock from the 1960s and 1970s. This is Osbourne's first and only album to feature cover songs from various artists, although in 1982, Osbourne had released the live album Speak of the Devil featuring renditions of songs from his time with Black Sabbath. All but 4 songs were originally released in the box set Prince of Darkness, released earlier the same year. The additional songs on this album which are not featured in Prince of Darkness are "Rocky Mountain Way", "Sunshine of Your Love", "Woman" and "Go Now". Whilst he cites The Beatles as his favourite band, his favourite song of all time is Procol Harum's "A Whiter Shade of Pale". He had wished to cover this song but was advised against it since it had recently been covered by a "close musical associate" (then-former guitarist Zakk Wylde covered the song with his band Black Label Society on their 2004 album Hangover Music Vol. VI). Under Cover is the only Osbourne album to feature the work of Alice in Chains' guitarist Jerry Cantrell or
