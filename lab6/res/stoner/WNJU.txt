WNJU
WNJU, virtual channel 47 (UHF digital channel 35), is a Spanish-language television station licensed to Linden, New Jersey, United States and serving the New York City television market. It is one of two East Coast flagship stations of the Telemundo network (alongside WSCV in Miamiâ€“Fort Lauderdale, Florida). WNJU is owned by the Telemundo Station Group subsidiary of NBCUniversal (itself a subsidiary of Comcast), as part of a duopoly with New York-licensed NBC flagship WNBC (channel 4). WNJU's studios are located in Fort Lee, New Jersey, and it shares transmitter facilities with WNBC at One World Trade Center. History WNJU-TV signed on the air on May 16, 1965 as the first commercial UHF station in the New York television market (WNYC-TV was the first UHF station to sign on the air in 1961, but it was operated as a non-commercial educational station for its first 35 years of existence despite having a commercial license). The station originally broadcast from the Mosque Theater (now Newark Symphony Hall), located at 1020 Broad Street in Newark, in the former studios of WATV (channel 13). The station was owned by Henry Becton (son of Maxwell Becton, co-founder of Becton Dickinson) and Fairleigh S. Dickinson Jr.
