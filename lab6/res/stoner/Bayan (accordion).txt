Bayan (accordion)
The bayan (Russian: бая́н, IPA: [bɐˈjan]) is a type of chromatic button accordion developed in Russia in the early 20th century and named after the 11th-century bard Boyan. Characteristics The bayan differs from western chromatic button accordions in some details of construction: Reeds are broader and rectangular (rather than trapezoidal). Reeds are often attached in large groups to a common plate (rather than in pairs); the plates are screwed to the reed block (rather than attached with wax). The melody-side keyboard is attached near the middle of the body (rather than at the rear). Reeds are generally not tuned with tremolo. Register switches may be operated with the chin on some larger models. (also possible with some larger European button accordions) The diminished chord row is shifted, so that the diminished G chord is where one would expect the diminished C chord in the Stradella bass system. Converter switches that go from standard preset chords to free bass (individual bass notes) are common on the larger instruments. As opposed to Western conventions, in free bass mode the low notes usually are at the bottom of the instrument and the high notes at the top. Newer instruments may feature a register
