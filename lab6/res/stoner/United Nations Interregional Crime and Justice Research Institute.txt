United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute
The United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute (UNICRI) is one of the five United Nations Research and Training Institutes. The Institute was founded in 1968 to assist the international community in formulating and implementing improved policies in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice. History In 1965, the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) outlined in Resolution 1086 B (XXXIX) the organisational arrangements for a United Nations Social Defence Programme. In 1967, UN Secretary-General U Thant issued Bulletin ST/SGB/134, which established the United Nations Social Defence Research Institute (UNSDRI), mandated to develop "new knowledge and the application thereof in advancing policy and practice in the prevention and control of both juvenile delinquency and adult criminality" through research and technical support. The United Nations and the Italian Government signed an agreement in 1968 for the establishment of UNSDRI's Headquarters in Rome and the Institute was formally inaugurated the following year by the UN Secretary-General. Under ECOSOC Resolution No. 1989/56, the Institute was renamed the United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute (UNICRI) in 1989. Its mandate was enlarged through the adoption of its present statute. UNICRI moved its Headquarters from Rome to Turin in 2000. Aims
