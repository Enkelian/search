Aux (TV channel)
A.Side TV is a Canadian English language specialty channel owned by Blue Ant Media, as the television version of the website music brand, A.Side, which launched in May 2017. The channel originally launched in 2009 and adopted its current name in 2017. History As Aux (2009-2016) Aux was originally owned by Glassbox Television and launched as both a website, built on an Internet television model, and a programming block on sister channel BiteTV (which became Makeful in August 2015). Both the website and the programming block launched on November 24, 2008 and focused on music related programming featuring independent, and new and emerging artists in alternative, hip hop, indie rock, indie pop and other similar genres. In February 2009, Aux participated with CBC Radio 3 and Exclaim! to launch "X3", a new collaborative cross-promotional platform which saw all three outlets air or publish content spotlighting a particular "Artist of the Month". X3 artists of the month have included K'naan, Malajube, Thunderheist, Japandroids, Apostle of Hustle and The Rural Alberta Advantage. The project ceased in 2012. Glassbox Television received approval by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to launch Aux as a national English-language category 2 specialty channel on March
