Uytengsu Aquatics Center
The Uytengsu Aquatics Center (originally the McDonald's Olympic Swim Stadium) is a 2,500-seat outdoor aquatics venue located on the campus of the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, USA. The facility features two pools: a long course pool (50x25 meters), and a diving well (25x25 yards) with towers. The facility is the home pool for the USC Trojans swimming and diving teams. The facility was originally constructed for the 1984 Summer Olympics, and opened in July 1983. Financial assistance for the construction of the facility came from McDonald's, and for the first 29 years of its existence, the stadium bore the name McDonald's Olympic Swim Stadium.At the time of the '84 Games, it was called the "Olympic Swim Stadium", and was the main aquatics venue at the Games, hosting competitions in swimming, diving, and synchronized swimming. (Water polo was held at Raleigh Runnels Memorial Pool in Malibu, California.) For the Games, the facility featured temporary bleacher seating around the two pools, which was removed after the Games. In 1989, the Lyon Center was built on a portion of the land where the Games stands were. The pool has hosted several high-level national meets since 1984, including the 1989 U.S.
