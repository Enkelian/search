Decibel Festival
Decibel Festival was an annual music and digital arts festival started in 2004 in Seattle by Sean Horton and pulled into existence by the talent, sweat, and loyalty of an entirely volunteer staff. Decibel was dedicated to live electronic music performance, visual art and new media. History The core of the festival consisted of concerts, performances, commissioned work, film screenings and exhibitions. The programming was presented in a variety of locations throughout Seattle including the Capitol Hill neighborhood and Downtown. In addition to these performance programs, Decibel included a professional section featuring panels, lectures and workshops, which served as a meeting ground for leading-edge artists, labels and music gear manufacturers.In fall 2011, Decibel celebrated its largest edition to date, pulling in over 23,000 attendees. The 2011 edition sold both record numbers of festival passes (up 18% from 2010) and individual showcase tickets (up 45% from 2010). That was the peak. Despite years of stated intent to publications, attendees, supporters, artists, and volunteer staff to become a nonprofit organization, it never materialized. After that festival high in 2011, Decibel would come to an end in 2015. Horton moved to Los Angeles. He has hinted and teased that the festival would return
