The competition rules at the time for the Copa del Rey allowed sides a maximum of three youth players per match, leaving Barcelona with a squad of ten players for the return leg against Atlético de Madrid. The ten Barcelona players refused to take to the field as a protest against the Spanish FA (RFEF), thus forfeiting the match.
