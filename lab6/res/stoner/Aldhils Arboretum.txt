Aldhils Arboretum
Aldhils Arboretum is the fifth full-length album by indie rock band Of Montreal. It was intended to be a departure from their previous concept albums, The Gay Parade and Coquelicot Asleep in the Poppies: A Variety of Whimsical Verse. Instead of a unified theme, this album is a "singles" album of sorts, with each song being its own story alone. Track listing All songs written by Kevin Barnes.
