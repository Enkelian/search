Lord Tracy is a hard rock band formed in 1985. Lord Tracy originally consisted of former Black Oak Arkansas bassist Kinley "Barney" Wolfe, drummer Chris Craig and guitarist Jimmy Rusidoff. Terry Glaze, formerly of Pantera, joined in 1986 as lead vocalist. Their first album, Deaf Gods of Babylon, was released in the fall of 1989 on UNI Records / MCA. The album's lead single, "Out With The Boys," reached No. 40 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Chart. A ballad, "Foolish Love," was the album's follow up single. Although the Deaf Gods Of Babylon album failed to sell many copies, it remains a notable release for its use of humor and its diverse influences, ranging from Beastie Boys to Motörhead. Following the release of Deaf Gods, the band toured extensively from 1989–1991 and broke apart while on the road in the summer of 1991. Bassist Kinley Wolfe would go on to join The Cult as a touring member from 1991 to 1994 and then teamed up with guitarist Mark Christian from The Big F in the band Milk The Cow whose eponymous debut was issued in 1996.
