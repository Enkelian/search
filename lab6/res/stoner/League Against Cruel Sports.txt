League Against Cruel Sports
The League Against Cruel Sports is an animal welfare charity which campaigns to stop blood sports such as fox, hare and deer hunting, game bird shooting and animal fighting. The charity is recognised as being instrumental in bringing about the Hunting Act 2004, which banned hunting with hounds in England and Wales and the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002, which did the same in Scotland. Today, the League calls for those pieces of legislation to be strengthened. Famous supporters include Ricky Gervais, Jo Brand, John Bishop, Sir David Jason, and Gemma Atkinson. The current president is naturalist Bill Oddie OBE. History The League Against Cruel Sports was founded in 1924 by Ernest Bell and Henry Amos.

Footage taken of hunts proved central in stopping attempted repeal of the Hunting Act in England and Wales and resulted in the Scottish Government announcing hunting laws in the country would be strengthened. Educate: The League educates the public and policy makers through media, campaigns
