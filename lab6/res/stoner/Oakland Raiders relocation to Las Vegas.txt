Oakland Raiders relocation to Las Vegas
The Oakland Raiders relocation to Las Vegas saw the Oakland Raiders, an American football club in the National Football League (NFL), move from its longtime home of Oakland, California, to the Las Vegas, Nevada metropolitan area. The renamed Las Vegas Raiders are to play home games at Allegiant Stadium located in Paradise, Nevada, which is to open in July 2020; if construction is delayed due to unforseen circumstances, the Raiders may elect to play in Oakland for the 2020 season as long as they make the decision before April 1, 2020.The Raiders' move follows years of failed efforts by team owner Mark Davis to renovate or replace the Oakland Coliseum, which has been consistently rated as one of the worst stadiums in the NFL. NFL team owners approved the move, 31â€“1, at their annual league meeting in Phoenix, Arizona, on March 27, 2017.The Raiders became the third NFL franchise in the 2010s to announce a move, following the Rams' 2016 return from St. Louis, Missouri to Los Angeles, California, and the Chargers' 2017 move from San Diego to the Los Angeles suburb of Carson, California.
