Zonule of Zinn
The zonule of Zinn () (Zinn's membrane, ciliary zonule) (after Johann Gottfried Zinn) is a ring of fibrous strands forming a zonule (little band) that connects the ciliary body with the crystalline lens of the eye. These fibers are sometimes collectively referred to as the suspensory ligaments of the lens, as they act like suspensory ligaments. Development The ciliary epithelial cells of the eye probably synthesize portions of the zonules. Anatomy The zonule of Zinn is split into two layers: a thin layer, which lines the hyaloid fossa, and a thicker layer, which is a collection of zonular fibers. Together, the fibers are known as the suspensory ligament of the lens. The zonules are about 1–2 μm in diameter.The zonules attach to the lens capsule 2mm anterior and 1 mm posterior to the equator, and arise from the pars plana region of the ciliary epithelium and pass forward closely related to the lateral surfaces of the ciliary process of the pars plicata. When colour granules are displaced from the Zonules of Zinn (by friction against the lens), the irises slowly fade. In some cases those colour granules clog the channels and lead to Glaucoma Pigmentosa. The zonules are primarily made
