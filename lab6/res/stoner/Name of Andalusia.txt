Name of Andalusia
The toponym al-Andalus (الأندلس) is first attested in inscriptions on coins minted by the Umayyad rulers of Iberia, from ca. 715.The etymology of the name has traditionally been derived from the name of the Vandals (who settled in Hispania in the 5th century). A number of proposals since the 1980s have contested this: Vallvé (1986) proposed derivation of the name of the Atlantic. Halm (1989) derives the name from a reconstructed Gothic term *landahlauts. Bossong (2002) suggests derivation from a pre-Roman substrate. Corriente (2008) suggests a derivation from Coptic *emendelēs, "southwest".The Spanish form Andalucía was introduced in the 13th century. The name was adopted to refer those territories still under the Moorish rule until then, and generally south of Castilla Nueva and Valencia, and corresponding with the former Roman province hitherto called Baetica in Latin sources. This was a Castilianization of Al-Andalusiya, the adjectival form of the Arabic word al-Andalus. Vandal theory The oldest theory derives the name from the name of the Vandals, the Germanic tribe which colonized parts of Iberia from 409 to 429.That derivation goes back to the 13th-century De rebus Hispaniae. In the 14th century, Ibn Khaldun derived the name from al-Fandalus, the Vandals. Reinhart Dozy
