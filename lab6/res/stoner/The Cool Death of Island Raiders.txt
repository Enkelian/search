The Cool Death of Island Raiders
The Cool Death of Island Raiders is the fifth studio album by the American garage rock band Thee Oh Sees, released on March 7, 2006 on Narnack Records. Co-produced by TV on the Radio members Dave Sitek and Kyp Malone, the album was released under the names, The Ohsees and The Oh Sees, and is the first studio album to feature backing vocalist and future keyboardist Brigid Dawson. The album features mostly freak folk songs, alongside experimental drone compositions. Reception Upon the album's release, Pitchfork's Cory D. Byrom gave it a mostly negative review, writing: "Dwyer's work here is a mess. He relies too heavily on the freak half of freak folk, burying the songs in grating arrangements and murky production."
