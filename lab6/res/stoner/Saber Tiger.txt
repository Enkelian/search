It was founded in 1981 by guitarist and sole-constant member Akihito Kinoshita, who is responsible for producing, engineering and composing most of the band's work. Biography Saber Tiger was formed in 1981 by guitarist Akihito Kinoshita. After releasing three albums through an independent record label, the band had what appeared to be a temporary break-up. However, Kinoshita worked around this and signed a major label contract with Tokuma Japan Communications. Saber Tiger's 1997 major debut album, Project One, thrust the band to the front of the flourishing Japanese metal scene. The album is essentially a solo album from Kinoshita, with famous guest musicians; vocalist Ron Keel (ex-Steeler and Keel), bassist Naoto Shibata (Anthem), and drummer Hirotsugu Honma (ex-Ezo and Loudness).Saber Tiger then went on to record and release three hit albums (as well as a few others) while officially reformed with Takenori Shimoyama on vocals, Tomohiro Sanpei on bass, and Yoshio Isoda on drums. Working together they produced two more albums, Paragraph 3 and Brain Drain. In 2001, Saber Tiger made their first release under their new major label VAP, naming the album simply Saber
