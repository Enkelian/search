1893 Brooklyn Grooms season
The 1893 Brooklyn Grooms finished a disappointing seventh in the National League race under new player/manager Dave Foutz. The highlight of the year was when pitcher Brickyard Kennedy became the first major leaguer to pitch and win two games on the same day since the mound was moved back to 60 feet. He allowed just eight hits in beating the Louisville Colonels 3–0 and 6–2 in a doubleheader on May 30, 1893. Offseason February 5, 1893: John Montgomery Ward was signed as a free agent by the Grooms. February 15, 1893: John Montgomery Ward was sold by the Grooms to the New York Giants for $6,000. February 18, 1893: Bill Joyce and cash were traded by the Grooms to the Washington Senators for Danny Richardson.
