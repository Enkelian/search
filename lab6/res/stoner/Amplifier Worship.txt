Amplifier Worship
Amplifier Worship is the second album by Japanese band Boris. Excluding the "one-long-song" albums, this is one of only two Boris full-lengths to have vocals on every song (the other being 2008's Smile), and the first time that Takeshi performed lead vocals for the band (although Atsuo performs lead vocals on "Huge"). "Vomitself" was written and laid down separately at Sound Square while the other four songs were recorded at Sound Crew. According to Japanese production company FoodUnited, videos were shot for "Hama" and "Kuruimizu" but were not released to the public. The Southern Lord vinyl issue features new artwork but uses the same crossfading despite the track order change and the inability to segue across sides; these issues are solved either with new crossfades (the two songs on side A) or cut offs (the rest of the sides). Studio reworkings of "Huge" and "Vomitself" appear on their collaborative album with Merzbow, Gensho.
