Chéri (film)
Chéri is a 2009 drama film directed by Stephen Frears. Starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Rupert Friend, it is an adaptation of the novel Chéri by French author Colette. The film premiered at the 2009 Berlin International Film Festival. Plot Set in 1900s Belle Époque Paris, Chéri tells the story of an affair between a wealthy, middle-aged retired courtesan, Léa, and Fred, nicknamed Cheri ("Dear" or "Darling"), the flamboyant spoiled, neglected 19-year-old only son of another even wealthier courtesan. A famous beauty, Léa has been successful at extracting large sums of money from her up-scale clients, never falling in love with any of them. At first Léa takes Chéri off her "friend" (and former rival) Charlotte's hands as a favor, as his dissipated lifestyle is irritating to Charlotte and unhealthy for Chéri. Although Léa only plans on keeping Chéri around for a short while, their affair turns into a six-year relationship, in which Léa pays for Chéri's expenses, (although he has access to considerable wealth from his mother) and Chéri wears Léa's silk pajamas and pearls. Although they satisfy each other both sexually and emotionally, the two convince themselves that their affair is casual, but they are the only real friend
