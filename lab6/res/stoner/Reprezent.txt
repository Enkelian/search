Reprezent
Reprezent 107.3 FM is a youth-led radio station based in Brixton, South London that reaches young people aged between 13-25. History The station has its origin in a one-month Restricted Service Licence focusing on youth issues including gun and knife crime, which was a successful broadcast that enabled them to apply for a community radio licence. Reprezent was awarded a community license in 2010, and from April 2011 has been broadcasting live across London. Playing grime, hip hop, dance music, and alternative music, it champions youth culture. Reprezent provides a platform for young people to showcase their talents but also to discuss social issues that affect them. It aims to challenge youth stereotypes and help young people better represent themselves in society. Their licence agreement says that: The station will give young people in south London access to their own platform for discussing issues that matter to them, representing their views, and dispelling negative stereotypes; and feature music they like, and which is rarely played on mainstream services. In 2016, Reprezent started broadcasting on DAB in London alongside their FM frequency. Reprezent broadcasts from three converted shipping containers in the Pop Brixton park.
