Church Divinity School of the Pacific
Church Divinity School of the Pacific (CDSP) is one of the nine seminaries of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America. It is located in Berkeley, California, and is a member of the Graduate Theological Union. The only Episcopal seminary located in the Far West, CDSP has, since 1911, been designated the official seminary of the Episcopal Church's Eighth Province, the Province west of the Rocky Mountains. The Church Divinity School of the Pacific, or CDSP, and Trinity Church Wall Street announced March 4 that the New York parish had acquired the seminary. The Very Rev. W. Mark Richardson, CDSP president and dean, told Episcopal News Service in an interview that the deal will put the school on a solid financial footing and position it for growth. CDSP and its assets now belong to Trinity, he said, and the value of those assets “will be a fund, among other resources they have, that supports the program at the school and operation.”CDSP is accredited by the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada and offers a variety of degree and certificate programs aimed at training clergy and lay leaders for ministries in the Anglican Communion.
