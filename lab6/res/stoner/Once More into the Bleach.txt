Once More into the Bleach
Once More into the Bleach is a remix album released in December 1988 by the band Blondie and Debbie Harry. The 13-track compilation contains remixes of Blondie songs and material from Debbie Harry's solo career. Overview The title of the album is a pun on a line from Henry V, a history play by William Shakespeare, "once more unto the breach", with a nod to hair bleach. The album was issued as a double vinyl, double cassette album, and on CD. On the US edition of the album track five "Rapture" (Bonus Beats) is replaced with the original version of "Atomic" from the album Eat to the Beat. Once More into the Bleach spun off two single releases: "Denis", a remix by Dancin' Danny D which is the first official Blondie remix single (also known as "Denis '88") and "Call Me", a remix by Ben Liebrand. The singles reached #50 and #61 in the UK respectively. The Shep Pettibone remix of "Heart of Glass" had a limited release as a single in several territories.
