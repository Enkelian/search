Green Mountain Transit
Green Mountain Transit (GMT) is the regional public transit system based in Burlington, Vermont, which was formed in 2016 through the merger of two more localized transit systems: the Chittenden County Transportation Authority and the Green Mountain Transit Authority. Chittenden County area Transit center, buses and routes GMT's Downtown Transit Center, which generally serves local routes, is located in downtown Burlington on Saint Paul Street, between Pearl and Cherry Streets, with adjoining space along Pearl Street. All of the commuter and express routes (36, 46, 56, 76, 86, 96, 97) generally operate from Pearl Street in the vicinity of Saint Paul Street. Most of the fleet is made up of Gillig low-floor transit buses, although a number of older RTS transit buses remain in use, particularly on Burlington Neighborhood Special (school bus) routes. In recent years, MCI long-distance buses and various shuttle buses built on Ford F350 chassis have been purchased for intercity routes and transit service in outlying towns, respectively. Local routes (NextGen) In June 2019, most local routes were combined and through-routed via the Downtown Transit Center (DTC) and given new schedules. Most local routes operate seven days a week (certain holidays excluded) with 20-minute or 30-minute service
