SWLABR
"SWLABR" is a song by British rock band Cream. Recorded in 1967, it first appeared on the album Disraeli Gears (1967). Later, the song was included as the B-side to Cream's "Sunshine of Your Love" single. Background The song was a collaborative writing effort between poet Pete Brown and bassist Jack Bruce, with Brown providing the lyrics and Bruce the music. Bruce sings and plays bass guitar, with Eric Clapton on guitars, and Ginger Baker on drums. The title is an initialism for "She Walks Like a Bearded Rainbow". Bruce later commented that the W stood for "Was" rather than "Walks". This alternative title was also referenced by Brown in a 2006 interview.A live version of "SWLABR" was released on BBC Sessions and the Deluxe Edition of Disraeli Gears. A four-minute demo version also appeared on the Disraeli Gears Deluxe Edition. The studio version appears on several Cream compilation albums, including Best of Cream, Heavy Cream, Strange Brew: The Very Best of Cream, The Very Best of Cream, Those Were the Days, and Gold.
