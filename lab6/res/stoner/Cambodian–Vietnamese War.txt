Cambodian–Vietnamese War
The Cambodian–Vietnamese War (Khmer: សង្គ្រាមកម្ពុជា-វៀតណាម, Vietnamese: Chiến tranh Campuchia–Việt Nam), known in Vietnam as the Counter-offensive on the Southwestern border (Vietnamese: Chiến dịch Phản công Biên giới Tây-Nam), and by Cambodian nationalists as the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia (Khmer: ការលុកលុយរបស់វៀតណាមមកកម្ពុជា), was an armed conflict between the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and Democratic Kampuchea. The war began with the repeated attacks by Khmer Rouge Army on the southwestern border of Vietnam, with the defining moment of Ba Chuc massacre, resulting in the deaths of over 3000 Vietnamese civilians . On 25 December 1978, Vietnam launched a full-scale invasion of Kampuchea and subsequently occupied the country and removed the government of the Communist Party of Kampuchea from power. During the Vietnam War, Vietnamese and Cambodian communists had formed an alliance to fight U.S.-backed regimes in their respective countries. Despite their open display of cooperation with the Vietnamese, the Khmer Rouge leadership feared that the Vietnamese communists were scheming to form an Indochinese federation with Vietnam as the dominant force in the region. In order to preempt an attempt by the Vietnamese to dominate them, the Khmer Rouge leadership began purging Vietnamese-trained personnel within their own ranks as the Lon Nol regime capitulated
