Coronado Mall
Coronado Center is a shopping mall in Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States. Built in 1965 by the Homart Development Company, a defunct real-estate division of the department store Sears, the mall has undergone several renovations and expansions in its history which have led to it becoming the largest in the state. Its anchor stores include Macy's, J. C. Penney, Dick's Sporting Goods, Round One Entertainment, and Kohl's, with one vacancy formerly occupied by Sears; other major tenants include Barnes & Noble, H&M, Forever 21, The Container Store, The Cheesecake Factory, and Boot Barn. The mall features over 130 stores, including a food court, and it is managed by Brookfield Properties. Background Coronado Center opened in March 1965 as an open-air mall, and was developed by Homart Development Company, the mall-building subsidiary of Sears. It was remodeled in 1975-1976 (when it became an enclosed mall), 1984, 1992, and 1995. History When Coronado Center first opened in 1965, the mall's original anchor tenants included Sears and Rhodes Brothers. In 1974, Rhodes Brothers was re-branded as Liberty House. In the mall's 1975-1976 expansion, two new anchor stores (Goldwater's and The Broadway) were added, and in 1984 a fifth anchor store (Sanger-Harris) was added.
