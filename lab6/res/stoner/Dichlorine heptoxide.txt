Dichlorine heptoxide
Dichlorine heptoxide is the chemical compound with the formula Cl2O7. This chlorine oxide is the anhydride of perchloric acid. It is produced by the careful distillation of perchloric acid in the presence of the dehydrating agent phosphorus pentoxide: 2 HClO4 + P4O10 → Cl2O7 + H2P4O11The chlorine(VII) oxide can be distilled off from the mixture. It may also be formed by illumination on mixtures of chlorine and ozone. It slowly hydrolyzes back to perchloric acid, which is also hazardous when anhydrous. Structure Cl2O7 is an endergonic molecule, meaning it is intrinsically unstable, decomposing to its constituent elements with release of energy: 2 Cl2O7 → 2 Cl2 + 7 O2 (ΔH° = –132 kcal/mol)Cl2O7 is bent with Cl−O−Cl angle of 118.6° giving the molecule C2 symmetry. The terminal Cl−O distances are 1.709 Å and the Cl=O distances are 1.405 Å. In this compound, chlorine exists in its highest formal oxidation state of +7, although the bonding in this molecule is significantly covalent. Chemistry Dichlorine heptoxide reacts with primary and secondary amines in carbon tetrachloride solution to yield perchloric amides: 2 RNH2 + Cl2O7 → 2 RNHClO3 + H2O 2 R2NH + Cl2O7 → 2 R2NClO3 + H2OIt also reacts with alkenes
