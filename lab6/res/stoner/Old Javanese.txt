Old Javanese
Kawi, or Old Javanese, is the oldest attested phase of the Javanese language. It was spoken in the eastern part of what is now Central Java and the whole of East Java, Indonesia. As a literary language, Kawi was used across Java and on the islands of Madura, Bali and Lombok. It had a sizable vocabulary of Sanskrit loanwords but had not yet developed the formal krama language register, to be used with one's social superiors, that is so characteristic of modern Javanese. Name The names 'Kawi' (ꦨꦴꦰꦏꦮꦶ Bhāṣa Kawi), from Sanskrit: कवि kavi "poet", and 'Old Javanese' are often used interchangeably. Sometimes, however, 'Old Javanese' is used for the historical spoken language that was ancestral to modern Javanese, while the name 'Kawi' is restricted to the standardized written form of Old Javanese, still used to some extent as a literary language. The name "kawi" is derived from the root ku, which in Sanskrit means “poet”, and, in derived forms, a “wise, educated man”. The syllabic meter of Kawi poetry is sekar kawi, which means “flowers of the language”, sekar itself deriving from the Sanskrit "sekhara" (“garland”). History While evidence of writing in Java dates to the Sanskrit "Tarumanegara inscription"
