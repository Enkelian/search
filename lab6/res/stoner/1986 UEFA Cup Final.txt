1986 UEFA Cup Final
The 1986 UEFA Cup Final was a football tie played on 30 April and 6 May 1986 between Real Madrid C.F. of Spain and 1. FC Köln of West Germany. Madrid won 5–3 on aggregate. The second leg was originally scheduled for Thursday 8 May, but was moved to Tuesday 6 May following a request by Real Madrid due to their domestic fixtures. The match was played in Berlin instead of Cologne because of sanctions imposed by UEFA on 1. FC Köln stipulating that they must play at least 350 km from their home stadium after trouble caused by supporters during the 2nd leg of the semi-final against Waregem.
