Seanad Éireann
Seanad Éireann ( (listen) SHAN-əd(h) AIR-ən, Irish: [ˈʃan̪ˠəd̪ˠ ˈeːɾʲən̪ˠ]; "Senate of Ireland") is the upper house of the Oireachtas (the Irish legislature), which also comprises the President of Ireland and Dáil Éireann (the lower house). It is commonly called the Seanad or Senate and its members senators (seanadóirí in Irish, singular: seanadóir). Unlike Dáil Éireann, it is not directly elected but consists of a mixture of members chosen by various methods. Its powers are much weaker than those of the Dáil and it can only delay laws with which it disagrees, rather than veto them outright. It can introduce new legislation. It has been located, since its establishment, in Leinster House. Composition Under Article 18 of the Constitution, Seanad Éireann consists of 60 senators, composed as follows: Eleven nominated by the Taoiseach. Six elected by the graduates of certain Irish universities: Three by graduates of the University of Dublin. Three by graduates of the National University of Ireland. 43 elected from five special panels of nominees (known as vocational panels) by an electorate consisting of TDs (members of Dáil Éireann), outgoing senators and members of city and county councils. Nomination is restrictive for the panel seats with only Oireachtas members
