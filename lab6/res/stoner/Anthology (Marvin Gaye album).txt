Anthology (Marvin Gaye album)
Anthology: The Best of Marvin Gaye is a double CD chronology of American singer Marvin Gaye's career throughout his twenty-year tenure with Motown Records from his first big hit, 1962's "Stubborn Kind of Fellow", to his final Motown R&B charter, "Heavy Love Affair" in 1981. The anthology also covered a set of duet recordings with Mary Wells, Kim Weston, Tammi Terrell, and Diana Ross, as well as unreleased recordings from the 1960s and 1970s. Gaye's Anthology set was actually released a total of three times in different track listings. The 1974 original, which charted, featured singles spanning from his 1962's "Stubborn" to material from his What's Going On album, while a 1986 re-issue featured songs from Let's Get It On, I Want You and duets with Diana Ross. The 1995 re-issue deleted some of the duets from the other two releases and included material from Gaye's later period (1978â€“1981). The set has since been out of stock for some time.
