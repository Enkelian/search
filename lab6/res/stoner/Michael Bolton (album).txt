Michael Bolton (album)
Michael Bolton is the third studio album by American recording artist Michael Bolton. It was Bolton's first record to be released, in 1983, on Columbia Records. This was also the first time that Bolton recorded under his stage name; his previous releases, Michael Bolotin and Everyday of My Life, had been released under his given name, Michael Bolotin. It features then future Kiss guitarist Bruce Kulick on lead guitar, rotating with Bolton himself. Future Trans-Siberian Orchestra/Savatage/Megadeth guitarist Al Pitrelli replaced Kulick on the tour supporting the single, "Fool's Game", though the tour was cancelled after four shows. Reception The Rolling Stone Album Guide said the album was "better balanced and more pop-savvy [than the rest of Bolton's first four albums], but falters when he attempts an over-burdened rendition of The Supremes' 'Back in My Arms Again'."Allmusic gave the album a generally negative retrospective review, saying that it was dominated by arena rock cliches, but acknowledged that "Bolton was an undeniably involving singer, and songs like 'Fools Game,' the lead-off track and chart single, were satisfying pop efforts".
