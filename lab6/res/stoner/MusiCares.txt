MusiCares
MusiCares Foundation is a non-profit organization established in 1989 and incorporated in 1993 by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. Meant for musicians to have a place to turn in times of financial, personal, or medical crisis, its primary purpose is to focus the resources and attention of the music industry on human service issues which directly impact the health and welfare of the music community. The foundation's programs include emergency financial assistance, addiction recovery, outreach and leadership activities, and senior housing. MusiCares also offers hearing clinics backstage at several major festivals around the U.S. to help musicians protect their ears. Since 1989, MusiCares has distributed more than $48 million to artists in need.In September 2004, MusiCares acquired the Musicians Assistance Program, a similar program assisting musicians in need, including drug rehabilitation.MusiCares awards recording artists with the "Person of the Year Award", to commend musicians for their artistic achievement in the music industry and dedication to philanthropy, and with the "Stevie Ray Vaughan Award", to honor musicians on their commitment to helping others in the addiction recovery process.
