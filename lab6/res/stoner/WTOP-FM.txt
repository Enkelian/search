WTOP-FM
WTOP-FM (103.5 FM) – branded WTOP Radio and WTOP News – is a commercial all-news radio station licensed to serve Washington, D.C. Owned by Hubbard Broadcasting, the station serves the Washington metropolitan area, extending its reach through two repeater stations: WTLP (103.9 FM) in Braddock Heights, Maryland, and WWWT-FM (107.7) in Manassas, Virginia. The WTOP-FM studios, referred to on-air as the "WTOP Glass-Enclosed Nerve Center", are located in the Washington D.C. neighborhood of Friendship Heights, while the station transmitter is located on the American University campus. Besides a standard analog transmission, WTOP-FM broadcasts over three HD Radio channels, and is available online. Historically, the 103.5 FM facility is perhaps best known as WGMS-FM, which operated with a commercial fine arts and classical music format from 1948 until 2006. WTOP-FM is considered the successor station to WTOP (1500 AM), now WFED, a station founded in Brooklyn, New York City in 1926 which moved to Washington the following year. WTOP and WTOP-FM have served as Washington's CBS affiliate for all but two years since first joining the network in 1929.
