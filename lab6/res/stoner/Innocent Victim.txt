Innocent Victim
Innocent Victim is the 11th studio album by British hard rock band Uriah Heep, released in November 1977 by Bronze Records in the UK and Warner Bros. Records in the US. Although it did not chart in the US or UK, Innocent Victim went on to sell more than 100,000 copies in Germany alone, and reached No. 19 and No. 44 in New Zealand and Australia, respectively. The single "Free Me" was a No. 3 hit in New Zealand and peaked at No. 3 in South Africa.The eyes of drummer Lee Kerslake were used for the snake on the cover artwork. In the US, the sleeve was a live photomontage instead. The album was remastered and reissued by Castle Communications in 1997 with two bonus tracks, and again in 2004 in an expanded deluxe edition including three live tracks recorded during the band's 1979 European tour (these are alternate versions to the ones released on the Live in Europe 1979 album).
