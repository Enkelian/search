Recover (Great White album)
Recover is a cover album released by the American hard rock band Great White in 2002. All of the tracks are covers of songs that the band gained the most influence from. The album was recorded live in studio in November 1989 as a two-track demo. The collection of covers of this album include songs already appeared in other Great White albums, such as the medley "Bitches and Other Women" on ...Twice Shy, "Down at the Doctors" on Hooked and "Ain't No Way to Treat a Lady" on Let It Rock. The covers of "Ready for Love" and "Fire and Water" are notable, as both were made famous by bands with Paul Rodgers as the lead singer. The former song was originally recorded by Mott the Hoople, whose guitarist Mick Ralphs was later in Bad Company and whose lead singer Ian Hunter originally performed "Once Bitten, Twice Shy", a major hit for Great White in 1989. The Dr. Feelgood song "Down at the Doctors" is misspelled in the credits as "Down to the Doctor". Recover was issued with an altered order of the songs by the label Axe Killer in France in 2002, under the name The Final Cuts and
