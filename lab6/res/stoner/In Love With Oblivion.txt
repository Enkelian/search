The album is the follow-up to 2010's "Shake the Shackles" 7-inch and 2008's debut Alight of Night. Reception It went on to receive much critical acclaim, being praised for expanding and even "perfecting" their sound according to Tim Sendra of the Allmusic guide, it achieved an even higher aggregate score on Metacritic than their lauded debut. While Doug Mosurock of Dusted Magazine and Other Music declared it a "blaring masterpiece," Edward Comentale, director of Undergraduate studies at Indiana University, in his 4-star review for Tiny Mix Tapes stated, "In Love with Oblivion delivers a singular brand of indie pop bliss 11 times in a row, and it proves that only a truly talented band can make something old sound new and vital again... Sinister American pop — whether it’s Johnny Cash or Jim Morrisson or Joey Ramone — never felt so good." AU Magazine, in a 9 out of 10 review, said simply, "Crystal Stilts have scaled the peaks of Noise-pop and have created a sublime album in doing so."
