Guitar synthesizer
A guitar synthesizer is any one of a number of musical instrument systems that allow a guitarist to access synthesizer capabilities. Overview Today's guitar synths are direct descendants of 1970s devices from manufacturers (often in partnership) such as Hammond Innovex and Ovation, EMS, Roland Corporation and FujiGen (GR-500 and GR-300), Ludwig, Norlin Music and Maestro, 360 Systems, Ampeg and Hagstr√∂m, Arp, Electro-Harmonix, Casio, New England Digital, Terratec/Axon, Starr Labs, Ibanez, Holt Electro Acoustic Research, Zeta Systems, and Yamaha. In the early days, there were three main types of guitar-synthesizers: Multi-effects type Frequency-to-Voltage converter type (using guitar with pickups) Guitorgan type (using guitar with fretboard switches)Later, the multi-effects type evolved into modeling guitar, and the other two types evolved into current devices. Presently, there are two main groups: Guitar-synth using guitars: regular guitars equipped with special electronic sensors that actuate a synthesizer Guitar-synth using non-guitar controllers: guitar-like MIDI controllers.Both types have advantages and disadvantages. Software solutions Though the term "MIDI guitar" is sometimes used as a synonym, MIDI is not the indispensable feature of guitar synthesizers, especially after advances in DSP technology. Software-based guitar synthesizers without any special pickups have appeared, featuring polyphonic audio recognition (recognizing polyphonic pitches of each string,
