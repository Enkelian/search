One of Those Nights (Tim McGraw song)
"One of Those Nights" is a song written by Luke Laird, Rodney Clawson, and Chris Tompkins and recorded by American country music artist Tim McGraw. It was released in November 2012 as the second single from his 2013 album Two Lanes of Freedom and his second one from Big Machine Records. Critical reception Billy Dukes of Taste of Country gave the song three stars out of five, writing that "McGraw certainly sounds refreshed on this new song from a new record label partner, but much like songs late in his career with Curb, it feels like an attempt is made to make every moment a huge moment." Matt Bjorke of Roughstock gave the song four stars out of five, calling it "a sweet little song with one of McGraw's most engaging vocals and a well-produced backing track." Ben Foster of Country Universe gave the song a C grade, saying that "a better hook could have compensated to some extent for the generally uninspiring lyrical content, but the way it is, thereâ€™s precious little for the listener to grab onto." Music video The music video was directed by Sherman Halsey and premiered in December 2012. Chart performance "One of Those Nights"
