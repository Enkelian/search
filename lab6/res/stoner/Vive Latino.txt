Vive Latino
Vive Latino - Festival Iberoamericano de Cultura Musical is an annual music festival held in Mexico City. It is one of the most important music festivals in Mexico, featuring a great variety of groups of many genres. The event takes place in Foro Sol usually in between the months of March and April. The duration of the festival has been either one or two days, depending on the number of live acts, but since 2010 the festival's length is between 2 or 3 days. The first edition was in 1998, and has been repeated yearly ever since (except for 1999 and 2002). The number of stages has changed over the time, ranging from 2 to 4. The festival's concept is to every year gather important and newcoming bands from all over Ibero-America for three days to create a space for alternative music and new proposals from different Spanish-speaking bands. In the history of the festival there's been a series of important musical performances by many arstists from Latin America and Spain, such as Caf√© Tacuba, Enrique Bunbury, Charly Garcia, Aterciopelados, Los Tres, Caifanes, Bersuit, El Cuarteto de Nos, Illya Kuryaki and the Valderramas, Los Planetas, Gustavo Cerati, Los Amigos Invisibles,
