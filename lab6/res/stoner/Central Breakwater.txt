Central Breakwater
The Central Breakwater (中央防波堤, Chūō bōhatei) is a breakwater and artificial island located in Tokyo Bay, adjacent to the Tokyo Gate Bridge. History The Central Breakwater was first constructed in 1973 and has been used as a site for waste disposal from Tokyo since then, forming two artificial islands in Tokyo Bay known as the Inner Landfill (内側埋立地) and the Outer Landfill (外側埋立地). The islands had a combined area of 377 hectares in 2011 and are expected to ultimately reach an area of 989 hectares. Jurisdiction dispute Jurisdiction over the Central Breakwater islands was disputed between the special wards of Koto and Ota for 4 decades. Under Japanese law, any boundary dispute may be submitted to the prefectural government (in this case, the Tokyo metropolitan government) for resolution; a similar dispute with regard to the nearby Odaiba and Ariake area was resolved in 1982 by splitting the area between the three special wards that claimed it. Koto has argued that the garbage used to create the landfill was hauled through Koto and that making the island part of the special ward would repay residents for their trouble, while Ota has argued that the site of the breakwater was historically used
