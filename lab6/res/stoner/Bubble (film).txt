Bubble (film)
Bubble is a 2005 American drama film directed by Steven Soderbergh about three low-paid doll factory workers, one of whom is murdered. Soderbergh also shot and edited the film under the pseudonyms Peter Andrews and Mary Ann Bernard, taken from his father's given names and his mother's maiden name, respectively. The film was shot on high-definition video. Bubble is unusual in that it had no traditional script and used only non-professional actors recruited from the Parkersburg, West Virginia and Belpre, Ohio area, where the film was shot. The lead, Debbie Doebereiner, was found working the drive-through window in a Parkersburg KFC. All lines were improvised according to an outline written by screenwriter Coleman Hough, who previously teamed with Soderbergh on Full Frontal. Bubble was the first of six films Soderbergh planned to shoot and release in the same manner. The film was released simultaneously in movie theaters and on the cable/satellite TV network HDNet Movies on January 27, 2006; the DVD was released a few days later, on January 31. Bubble received a Best Director nomination for Soderbergh at the 2007 Independent Spirit Awards. The score for the film was composed by Robert Pollard, an Ohio native. Plot In a
