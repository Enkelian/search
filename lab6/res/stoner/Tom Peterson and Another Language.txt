Tom Peterson and Another Language
Tom Peterson and Another Language is the debut and only (mini)-album from American musician and former Cheap Trick bassist Tom Peterson, released in 1984 under his group name Tom Peterson and Another Language. Background Petersson formed Another Language after departing Cheap Trick after the recording of their fifth studio album All Shook Up in 1980. Together with his then-wife Dagmar, a Swedish-born European model, Petersson began recording demos in the studio, which in turn led to the creation of the Another Language group. Petersson told Billboard in 1984: "The idea I had was to have a hard rock band with a fairly traditional setup, with a very light-sounding, sexy girl vocalist. At the time, groups like Missing Persons weren't around, and people thought I was nuts."With his wife on lead vocals, Petersson recruited session guitarist Jeffrey Rollings and drummer Thom Mooney for his new group in 1981. Due to on-going legal issues after leaving Cheap Trick, Petersson's plans for recording new material was postponed. He recalled to Billboard: "It was difficult getting into the studio to record, because all I was doing was going back and forth to a lawyer all day long."The band's mini-album Tom Peterson and Another Language
