Orders, decorations, and medals of Greece
The Greek honors system goes back to 1829 and the establishment of the Order of the Redeemer at the Fourth National Assembly at Argos. However, the relevant decree was signed in Nafplio by King Otto on May 20, 1833. The Grand Cross of the Order of the Redeemer remains the highest honor of Greece to this day.
