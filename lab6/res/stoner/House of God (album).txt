House of God (album)
House of God is the ninth studio album by the heavy metal band King Diamond, released in 2000. The album was remastered by Andy LaRocque and was re-released in 2009. House of God is the only album to feature guitarist Glen Drover and bassist Paul David Harbour and the last to feature drummer John Luke Hébert. Plot The album's storyline is loosely based on the legend of Rennes-le-Château. The album begins with a dirge-like monologue: "Upon the Cross he did not die, they tortured him, but he survived. Smuggled across the open sea, to Southern France, tranquility. There he married Magdalene, and founded another dynasty. A church was built upon a hill, to serve all of the gods at will." ("Upon the Cross") One night centuries later, a weary traveler becomes lost in the woods, in an area ominously called "The Devil's Hide," despite being familiar with the place. Unfortunately, he and his horse are soon surrounded by hungry wolves, watching from the forest ("The Trees Have Eyes"). Suddenly, a she-wolf with shining blue eyes appears, making all other wolves back away. Instinctively trusting this wolf, the traveler follows her to a small church at the bottom of a hill.
