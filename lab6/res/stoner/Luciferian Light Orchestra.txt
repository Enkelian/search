Inspiration and influences In his childhood Christofer enjoyed listening to classical music, and gradually became more interested in his father's '50s and '60s rock music.

As 9-year old, he started to listen to The Beatles, who also used brass and strings in songs like "Penny Lane". At an age of 11, his taste for music took a turn as he started to listen to hard rock and heavy metal bands like Accept, Judas Priest, W.A.S.P., Iron
