Fuzz Club
The Fuzz Club was an indie rock night hosted by University of Sheffield Union of Students, which ran from 1999 to 2009. It claimed to be the biggest students union rock night in the UK outside London. The night ran weekly on Thursdays throughout termtime and hosts new bands; sometimes local, sometimes national. The club provided a variety of music from heavy rock in the Bleach room to indie in the main fuzz room. Fuzz Club was part of the circuit for new bands trying to make a name for themselves. In recent years, it had hosted Keane, The Long Blondes, Editors, The Zutons, The Killers, Bloc Party, The xx, La Roux, Future of the Left, British Sea Power, 65daysofstatic, Ida Maria, Hot Chip, Florence and the Machine and The Others. The club night ran since 1999 and initially alternated with Bleach, a heavier rock night, which instead became resident in the Fuzz Club's second room - essentially part of Fuzz Club. At the end of the academic year 2008/09, the Fuzz Club is ended, with the last night held on 11 June 2009. The night has now been replaced with Live Wire, opening 23 September 2010.
