Barriemore Barlow
Barrie "Barriemore" Barlow (born 10 September 1949, Birmingham) is an English musician, best known as the drummer and percussionist for the rock band Jethro Tull, from May 1971 to June 1980. Christened Barrie, the 'Barriemore' was an affectation to suit the eccentric image of Jethro Tull (much as Jeffrey Hammond had become "Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond"). Early career Barlow first met Ian Anderson and John Evan in Blackpool, where the two were members of a beat group, The Blades. By then, Barlow had become an apprentice plastic injection mould tool fitter, but walked out in the middle of a maths exam to answer a call by Anderson and Evan to go to Nottingham that night for a suddenly-announced gig. Barlow did not go back to finish the exam. His first major public appearance was not as a musician, but as a TV extra in the series Coronation Street in which he briefly appeared alongside Anderson's then girlfriend, actress Yvonne Nickelson. Having left The John Evan Band, as The Blades were by then known, Barlow joined another local group "The All Jump Kangaroo Band" featuring and run by Andy Trueman, who became the production manager for Jethro Tull in 1995.
