2017 Berkeley protests
The 2017 Berkeley protests refer to a series of protests and clashes between organized groups that occurred in the city of Berkeley, California, in the vicinity of the University of California campus. Violence occurred predominantly between protesters opposed to US President Donald Trump, including activists such as socialists, anarchists, and antifa groups; and pro-Trump groups such as Republican, alt-lite, alt-right, neo-Nazis, and white nationalists. The majority of the participants on both sides were average people who wanted to listen to the speakers and peaceful students who opposed the speakers.The first event occurred on February 1, when Trump supporter Milo Yiannopoulos was scheduled to give a speech at the university. Two later incidents on March 4 and April 15, were pro-Trump rallies met by protesters. Another rally occurred on April 27, hosted by Kyle "Based Stickman" Chapman, Brittany Pettibone, Lauren Southern, and others at Martin Luther King Jr. Civic Center Park. This was scheduled after a planned speech by Ann Coulter was cancelled. A "Say No to Marxism" rally planned to be held in the same park on August 27 was officially canceled by the organizers, but still drew both Trump supporters and protesters. Protests and clashes continued into the month
