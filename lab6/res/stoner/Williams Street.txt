Williams Street
Williams Street Productions, LLC, simply known as Williams Street and formerly known as Ghost Planet Industries, is an American animation and live action television production studio division of Cartoon Network, which is owned by Warner Bros. Entertainment. The studio is the in-house production arm of Adult Swim. Keith Crofford oversees operations for the studio building, which also houses the Cartoon Network offices. Mike Lazzo oversaw operations for the studio alongside Crofford until 2019, when Lazzo retired from the company. Name and logo The current name of the company originates from the location of its headquarters building – which is also the home office for Adult Swim – at 1065 Williams Street NW in Atlanta, Georgia, near the current offices of TBS and TNT on Techwood Drive. The facility began as a carpet factory and was purchased by Turner as overflow offices for, among other things, set building and woodworking facilities, as well as CNN Field Engineering. Soon after CNN moved into the CNN Center in downtown Atlanta in the early 1980s, other Turner operations moved into the Techwood campus, an old country club which became the first headquarters for CNN. The street is named for early Atlanta settler Ammi Williams.
