Nirvana (band)
Nirvana was an American rock band formed in Aberdeen, Washington in 1987. It was founded by lead singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic. Nirvana went through a succession of drummers, the best known being Dave Grohl, who joined in 1990. Though the band dissolved in 1994 after the death of Cobain, their music maintains a popular following and continues to influence modern rock and roll culture. In the late 1980s, Nirvana established itself as part of the Seattle grunge scene, releasing its first album, Bleach, for the independent record label Sub Pop in 1989. They developed a sound that relied on dynamic contrasts, often between quiet verses and loud, heavy choruses. After signing to major label DGC Records in 1991, Nirvana found unexpected mainstream success with "Smells Like Teen Spirit", the first single from their landmark second album Nevermind (1991). A cultural phenomenon of the 1990s, the album went on to be certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Nirvana's sudden success popularized alternative rock, and Cobain found himself described as the "spokesman of a generation" and Nirvana the "flagship band" of Generation X.Following extensive tours and the 1992 compilation album Incesticide and EP
