"Cool the Engines" is a song written by Tom Scholz, Brad Delp and Fran Sheehan that was originally released on Boston's 1986 album Third Stage. In the US it was also released as a 12" promotional single backed with another song from Third Stage, "The Launch," and as the B-side to the third commercially released single from the album, "Can'tcha Say (You Believe in Me)/Still in Love." It reached #4 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart. Blllboard also rated it as the #25 Top Rock Track of 1987. It was also included on Boston's 1997 compilation album Greatest Hits. Writing and recording "Cool the Engines" was written and recorded during 1981 and 1982. Lead singer Delp described the recording of the song. He noted that often Scholz would write songs for Boston but since he was not the lead singer Delp had to adapt his singing style to Scholz' more keyboard or guitar-oriented arrangements. Scholz also usually had the melody for Delp to sing before completing the lyrics. But for "Cool the Engines" the lyrics were complete and Delp had an idea for how to sing the song, and offered to try it out for Scholz. Scholz liked this first
