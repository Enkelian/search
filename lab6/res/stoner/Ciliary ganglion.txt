Ciliary ganglion
The ciliary ganglion is a parasympathetic ganglion located just behind the eye in the posterior orbit. It measures 1–2 millimeters in diameter and in humans contains approximately 2,500 neurons. The oculomotor nerve coming into the ganglion contains preganglionic axons from the Edinger-Westphal nucleus (a part of the brainstem) which form synapses with the ciliary neurons. The postganglionic axons run in the short ciliary nerves and innervate two eye muscles: The pupillary sphincter muscle constricts the pupil, a movement known as pupillary constriction. Excessive constriction of the pupil is termed miosis, while excessive dilation of the pupil is termed mydriasis. the ciliary muscle contracts, releasing tension on the Zonular Fibers, making the lens more convex, this process is known as accommodation.Both of these muscles are involuntary – they are controlled by the autonomic nervous system. It is one of four parasympathetic ganglia of the head and neck. (The others are the submandibular ganglion, pterygopalatine ganglion, and otic ganglion). Anatomy Three types of nerve fibers run through the ciliary ganglion: a parasympathetic root of ciliary ganglion originating from Edinger westphal nucleus (or motor root) a sympathetic root of ciliary ganglion from internal carotid plexus a sensory root of ciliary ganglion Diseases Adie
