Through the Years (Jethro Tull album)
Through the Years is a compilation album by the progressive rock band Jethro Tull. It is something of a retrospective; with songs from many different periods in the band's history. It is not a greatest hits album; as it has many songs not on such albums (Such as "Quizz Kid", "Still Loving You Tonight" and "Beastie".) It has material spanning all over the band's existence, from their first album to Roots to Branches. The liner notes contain a short history of Jethro Tull, starting humorously with the question "Didn't Jethro Tull die of a drug overdose?"
