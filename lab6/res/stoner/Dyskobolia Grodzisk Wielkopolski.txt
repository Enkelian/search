Dyskobolia Grodzisk Wielkopolski
Dyskobolia Grodzisk Wielkopolski (Polish pronunciation: [dɨskɔˈbɔʎa ˈɡrɔdʑisk fʲɛlkɔˈpɔlski]) is a Polish football club based in Grodzisk Wielkopolski, Poland. History Dyskobolia Grodzisk Wielkopolski was founded on 30 April 1922. Its logo shows the Discobolus. After several decades in lower league football, the club was taken over in the mid-1990s by Zbigniew Drzymała, president of the Inter Groclin Auto company, and enjoyed an instant string of promotions culminating in the promotion to top level football in 1997. Not having its own youth backbone, the club was dependent on players predominantly over 30 years of age, mostly with former league experience. After performing reasonably in the autumn period of the 1997/98 season, they experienced a sudden drop in form, which resulted in relegation. However within a year Dyskobolia was in the top flight again. Although now having many younger and more success-hungry players in the squad, the club performed disastrously in the autumn of 1999, garnering just five points from fifteen games. An unexpected (and some say suspicious) form increase in the spring resulted in eight victories in a row, which was more than enough to fight off relegation. The club has been in the top flight ever since, enjoying second place honors
