Isadore Singer
Isadore Manuel Singer (born May 3, 1924) is an American mathematician. He is an Institute Professor in the Department of Mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a Professor Emeritus of Mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley.Singer is noted for his work with Michael Atiyah proving the Atiyahâ€“Singer index theorem in 1962, which paved the way for new interactions between pure mathematics and theoretical physics. In early 1980s, while a professor at Berkeley, Singer co-founded the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) with Shiing-Shen Chern and Calvin Moore. Biography Singer was born in Detroit, Michigan, and received his undergraduate degree from the University of Michigan in 1944. After obtaining his M.S. and Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1948 and 1950 respectively, Singer taught at UCLA, UC Berkeley and MIT, where he has spent the majority of his career.The development of Atiyah-Singer index theorem relied upon the Dirac operator, where Singer rediscovered its importance to mathematics before the formulation of his famous contribution. He founded the subject of triangulated operator algebras with Richard V. Kadison, developed analytic torsion with D.B. Ray and with Henry McKean introduced heat equation formulas to the index theorem. He was chair of the
