The Diminisher

When Bablicon informally dissolved in 2001, he began or joined a number of experimental jazz/rock projects, such as Michael Columbia and Icy Demons, and continued composing in Chicago.In 2006, McDonnell released a solo album on the label Unsound Records, titled Imaginary Volcano, under the name of The Diminisher. == References ==
