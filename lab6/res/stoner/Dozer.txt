Dozer
Dozer is a stoner rock band from Sweden. History Early years Dozer was formed in the great north in 1995 by Tommi Holappa, Fredrik Nordin, Erik BÃ¤ckwall and Magnus Larsson, playing local youth centres and supporting any bands that came to their hometown. In 1996 Magnus Larsson left and Johan Rockner joined the band. In 1998 the band recorded a Split EP with the American band Unida. The EP was originally released by MeteorCity and re-issued in 2005. Breakthrough and rise to success While trying to secure a record deal they sent a demo tape to Man's Ruin Records, a highly influential label in the stoner rock scene at the time. Frank Kozik, the owner of Man's Ruin, was thoroughly impressed and the band quickly recorded an album. In 2000 Dozer released their first album In The Tail of a Comet, which was recorded for only $500. The band's second album Madre de Dios was released on Man's Ruin in 2001 along with a vinyl version on Molten Universe. Man's Ruin Records closed down shortly after the release. For their third album they worked with top Swedish producer Chips Kiesbye, known for his work with bands such as The Hellacopters.
