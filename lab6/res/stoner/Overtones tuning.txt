Overtones tuning
Among alternative tunings for the guitar, an overtones tuning selects its open-string notes from the overtone sequence of a fundamental note. An example is the open tuning constituted by the first six overtones of the fundamental note C, namely C2-C3-G3-C4-E4-G4. Overtone tunings that are open tunings have been used in songs by folk musician Joni Mitchell and by rock guitarist Mick Ralphs of Bad Company; these open overtones-tunings select their open notes from the first six partials of their overtone sequence on C or G. For open tunings, the open strings and the frets are each associated with a major-chord, which is played by strumming the open strings or the strings after they have been barred at one fret with one finger, greatly simplifying major-chord playing. For each such open or barred chord, the overtones reinforce the bass note, increasing the guitar's volume of sound and resonance. In an open overtones-tuning, adjacent strings that differ by a third interval can be tuned in just intonation, resulting in greater consonance than thirds in equal temperament. Music theorist William Sethares has discussed an overtones tuning that uses six higher partials, from fourth to ninth, of the overtone sequence; his tuning is not
