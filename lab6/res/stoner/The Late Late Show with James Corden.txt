The Late Late Show with James Corden
The Late Late Show with James Corden (also known as Late Late) is an American late-night talk show hosted by James Corden on CBS. It is the fourth and current iteration of The Late Late Show. Airing in the U.S. from Monday to Friday nights, it is taped in front of a studio audience Monday through Thursday afternoons – during weeks in which first-run episodes are scheduled to air – at CBS Television City in Los Angeles, California in Studio 56, directly above the Bob Barker Studio (Studio 33). It is produced by Fulwell 73 and CBS Television Studios. Corden was announced as the show's new host on September 8, 2014, succeeding Craig Ferguson. Originally scheduled to premiere on March 9, 2015, CBS later pushed back the premiere to March 23, 2015, so the NCAA basketball tournament could be used to promote Corden's debut.On April 4, 2017, it was confirmed that Corden would bring The Late Late Show to England for three special episodes taped at the Central Hall Westminster. It was the third time in the show's history that it aired from another country, with Ferguson taking his incarnation to Paris, France in 2011 and Scotland in 2012. Corden
