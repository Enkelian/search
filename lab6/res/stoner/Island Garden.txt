Island Garden
Island Garden is an indoor arena in West Hempstead, New York, USA. The arena was built in 1998, and has a seating capacity of 5,000 people. It hosts a local youth basketball league. It was named for the original Island Garden, which stood just south of the present site. The original Island Garden Arena was built in 1957 by Arnold "Whitey" Carlson, a descendant of Swedish immigrants. Mr. Carlson's grandfather was Henrik Carlson, a noted San Diego sculptor who was the Foreign Art Director for the San Diego Exposition (now Balboa Park). Over the years, many concert acts such as Cream, Dave Clark Five, Tiny Tim, Louis Armstrong, The Byrds, Sly and the Family Stone, The Dave Brubeck Quartet and Bob Dylan performed at the venue. In addition to concerts there were also boxing matches, professional wrestling, circus, rodeos, stamp shows, midget car racing, and boat shows. The 5,200 seat arena also hosted the New York Nets of the American Basketball Association from 1969 to 1972. The facility hosted the 1971 Nassau County Boy's High School Basketball Championship game, won by South Side led by Beaver Smith, before a then event-record crowd of more than 3,000.
