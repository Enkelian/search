École d'ingénieurs généralistes La Rochelle
L'Ecole d'Ingénieurs en Génie des Systémes Industriels, also known as EIGSI (can be translated into 'Industrial systems engineering school'), is an engineering school (French Grandes écoles) situated in La Rochelle, a town on the Atlantic Ocean on the west coast of France. The EIGSI is a generalist engineering school, meaning that all the students are given a truly multidisciplinary education. In their fourth year, out of five, a specialisation can be chosen between: mechanical engineering, mecatronics, information systems, energy and environment, industrial management. Upon completion of the 5 years of study, and the required industry internships, a Master of Engineering is delivered (equivalent to 'diplôme d'ingénieur' in the French system). History 1902: the 'Ecole d’Electricité et de Mécanique Industrielles de Paris' (also referred as 'Ecole Violet' due to its situation in 'Violet street') was established in Paris, at the time teaching a small class of students electricity and mechanical engineering for the industry. 1987: the school leaves Paris and the alumni association take upon the challenge of creating a generalist engineering school tailored to answer the needs of industrial companies. 1990: the EIGSI - Ecole d'Ingénieurs en Génie des Systèmes Industriels opens for the first time in La Rochelle. 1991:
