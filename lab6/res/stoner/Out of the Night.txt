Out of the Night
Out of the Night is the first release by American hard rock band Great White in 1983. It was independently released and sold more than 8,000 copies in less than three months, with the band supporting Dokken in their 1983 US tour. This led to EMI picking up the band for their first full-length, eponymous LP. It was reissued as On Your Knees by Enigma Records in 1987, likely to capitalize on the band's growing popularity due to the album Once Bitten.... The songs also appeared on the US CD release of the live album Recovery: Live! and 3 of them ("Out of the Night", "On Your Knees" and "Dead End") appeared in the re-recorded versions on the debut LP.
