Ass on the Floor
"Ass on the Floor" (clean version: "A** on the Floor") is a song performed by Diddy and the duo Dirty Money, lifted from their debut album, Last Train to Paris. The song features guest vocals and production from record producer Swizz Beatz. It was released as the third UK single taken from the album on 18 April 2011. "Ass on the Floor" was co-written by the lead performers, as well as Leroy Watson. Incorporating pounding drums and shimmering synthesizers, "Ass on the Floor" was praised by critics as one of the best songs on Last Train to Paris. Most felt that the song had the potential to be heard in clubs around the world. An accompanying music video, filmed by Colin Tilley, has a cold icy theme and features the female members of Dirty Money taking the lead as the group poses for the camera across the winter wonderland-themed landscape. "Ass on the Floor" made its chart debut on the U.S. Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart at number eighty-eight. It has since peaked at number eighty. Background and composition "Ass on the Floor" is an atmospheric dance-floor filler, first released as part of Swizz Beatz' Monster Mondays on November 29, 2010.
