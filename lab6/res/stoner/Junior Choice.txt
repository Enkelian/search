Junior Choice
Children's Favourites, known as Junior Choice since 1967, is a BBC Radio programme originally broadcast from 1954 until 1982 with Christmas specials from 2007 until 2015 and again since 2017. Originally broadcast on the Light Programme on Saturday mornings from 9.10 to 9.55 (later, 9.00â€“10.00). Its precursor from 1952 was entitled Children's Choice, echoing the weekday Housewives' Choice.The programme played requests from children of all ages. For the first 11 years of its run, the programme was introduced by Derek McCulloch, Uncle Mac. McCulloch's grandfatherly tone was quintessentially 'old-school' BBC. His opening words "Hello children, everywhere!", his catch-phrase was a modification of his much earlier closing words "Goodnight children, everywhere" on Children's Hour.Children wrote in with requests often just to get their names mentioned on the radio. McCulloch ensured that all types of music were played whatever the majority had requested: not just children's pieces but a wide range of music from pop to hymns to the light classics. The signature tune until the mid-1960s was Puffin' Billy by Edward White played by the Melodi Light Orchestra. Later versions McCulloch made his last broadcast in 1965 and several other presenters were tried including Leslie Crowther. After Radio 1 and Radio
