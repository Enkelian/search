Transgression Tour
The Transgression Tour was a concert tour headlined by American industrial metal band Fear Factory, which took place from October 28, 2005 (Granada Theater, Lawrence, KS) to December 10, 2006 (House Of Blues, Las Vegas, NV), in support of their 6th studio album, Transgression. The last few dates from November to December 2006 were marketed as 15 Years Of Fear, in which the band played songs in chronological order, including rarely or never played songs such as "Crash Test", "Leechmaster" (both from Soul of a New Machine) or "H-K (Hunter-Killer)" (from Demanufacture). This is the last tour to feature Raymond Herrera and Christian Olde Wolbers, as they both left the band in early 2009. They were supported by Strapping Young Lad, Soilwork & Darkane on the American jaunt & Misery Index & Breed77 on the European jaunt. Set list Very few songs from Transgression were played often. While "540,000Â° Fahrenheit" & "Transgression" were played each show, "Spinal Compression" was played only four times (3 in 2005, 1 in 2006), "Contagion" was quite played during the European leg in 2006, and "Moment Of Impact" was played during the 15 Years Of Fear Leg. All those songs were never played since. Tour
