More4
More4 (stylized as 4More) is a British free-to-air television channel, owned by Channel Four Television Corporation. The channel launched on 10 October 2005. Content When the channel first launched in 2005, it mostly focused on US dramas and repeats of Channel 4 programmes. Having shown all five weekday editions of The Daily Show since More4's launch, in January 2011 the channel scaled back its commitment to one episode a week in order to increase investment in its arts programming.On 23 January 2012, More4 refocused towards more lifestyle based content. Documentaries which previously aired on the channel moved to its parent station Channel 4. Branding 2005â€“2012 In September 2005, Channel 4 began running teaser trailers for the new station (although the name was neither mentioned nor seen in the adverts). Showing neon lettering, the teasers hinted at "adult entertainment". Some people may have been confused by the deliberate double-meaning of these trailers and mistakenly presumed the new channel would be of a pornographic nature. The Daily Mail refused to accept launch advertising for the channel on these grounds. Advertisements starting at the end of September made it much clearer that the "adult entertainment" being offered was the 'intelligent and insightful' programming.
