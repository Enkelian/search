STV (TV channel)
STV is a Scottish free-to-air television channel serving Scotland. It operates the two ITV network licences in northern and central Scotland, formerly known as Grampian Television (now legally STV North Ltd) and Scottish Television (now legally STV Central Ltd). The brand was adopted on Tuesday 30 May 2006 replacing both franchises' identities. STV celebrated its 60th birthday in 2017, with special programmes broadcast on STV and the now defunct STV2. In 2013, STV won licences to launch local TV channels in Glasgow and Edinburgh. STV Glasgow launched on 2 June 2014, with STV Edinburgh following on 12 January 2015. From 24 April 2017, the city channels were rebranded as "STV2" and operated in combination with new franchises centred on Aberdeen, Dundee and Ayr. STV2 closed down in June 2018. Programming The two licences still produce regional programmes, although the only difference between them is the respective news programmes: STV News broadcasts separate bulletins to Northern Scotland (including an opt-out for the Tayside area), Glasgow/West Central Scotland, and Edinburgh/East Central Scotland. There is no STV South as Southern Scotland is part of the ITV Border region (Border being owned by ITV plc) and programmes are presented there under the ITV Border
