Meurthe-et-Moselle (French pronunciation: [mœʁt e mɔzɛl] (listen)) is a department in the Grand Est region of France, named after the Meurthe and Moselle rivers.

The only subsequent change took place in 1997 and involved the incorporation, for administrative reasons, of the little commune of Han-devant-Pierrepont which had previously fallen within the Meuse department.
