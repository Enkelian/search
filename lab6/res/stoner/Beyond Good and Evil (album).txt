Beyond Good and Evil (album)
Beyond Good and Evil is the seventh studio album by English rock band The Cult. Released in 2001, it marked their first new recording in six and a half years. The record debuted at #37 on the charts in the United States, #22 in Canada, #25 in Spain. Only one single, "Rise", was officially released and had a music video. The songs "Breathe" and "True Believers" were released as promotional singles but not as official singles. This album also marked the return of Matt Sorum as The Cult's drummer. Although Sorum had previously toured with the band on the Sonic Temple tour in 1989 and 1990, this was the first time that he had recorded a studio album with the band. Background and writing The title of the record is a reference to Friedrich Nietzsche's 1886 book of the same title, and it briefly had the mock working title of Bring Me the Head of Dave Grohl, referencing the frontman of Foo Fighters, and also the former drummer of Nirvana. In 2006, singer Ian Astbury claimed via the band's website that his preferred choice for the record's title was Demon Process. "My Bridges Burn" was originally titled "Save Me"; "Breathe"
