Windsor Arena (nicknamed The Barn, because of its age, wooden construction, and its appearance of a giant barn) is an indoor arena located in Windsor, Ontario. Its capacity is approximately 4,400 with standing room. The arena's ice is an asymmetrical 80 feet (24 m) by 195 feet (59 m) or 15,600 square feet (1,450 m2). The arena was the home of the Windsor Spitfires of the Ontario Hockey League from 1975â€“2008, at which time the team's home was moved to the WFCU Centre. History Originally named the Border Cities Arena, it hosted the Detroit Cougars (later renamed the Detroit Red Wings) for the 1926-1927 NHL season, while the Olympia Stadium was under construction. The Border Cities Arena, built in 1925 for the local junior hockey team, was expanded from 6,000 to 9,000 for the Cougars. The arena was later renamed the Windsor Arena. Having been constructed in 1924, the arena is among the oldest of its type in North America. Inside the arena's halls are pictures of teams gone by, of old matches and players, and of the construction of "The Barn", along with historic newspaper clippings related to the hockey teams that played under its roof over the years.
