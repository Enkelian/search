Donington Grand Prix
The Donington Grand Prix was a Grand Prix motor race held at the Donington Park circuit in Leicestershire, England, from 1935 to 1938. The Donington Grand Prix was held just four times, but quickly rose to prominence as one of the most important races in Europe. A fifth race was planned for 1939 but was cancelled due to the start of World War II. Winners Legacy Although not considered an official British Grand Prix, the Donington Grand Prix is widely regarded as being on a similar level of importance. It was the only major international Grand Prix held in the United Kingdom during the 1930s, and paved the way for the United Kingdom's rise to international prominence in Grand Prix Racing after the second World War.Although the circuit at Donington Park was closed in 1939 due to World War II, when it was requisitioned by the Ministry of Defence and was converted into a military vehicle depot, it would reopen in 1977, and top level Grand Prix racing would return for the one-off 1993 European Grand Prix. == References ==
