Dynorphin B
Dynorphin B, also known as rimorphin, is a form of dynorphin and an endogenous opioid peptide with the amino acid sequence Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Leu-Arg-Arg-Gln-Phe-Lys-Val-Val-Thr. Dynorphin B is generated as a proteolyic cleavage product of leumorphin, which in turn is a cleavage product of preproenkephalin B (prodynorphin). See also Dynorphin == References ==
