Germanium dichloride
Germanium dichloride is a chemical compound of germanium and chlorine with the formula GeCl2. It is a solid and contains germanium in the +2 oxidation state. Preparation Solid GeCl2 can be produced by passing germanium tetrachloride, GeCl4, over Ge metal at 650 °C. GeCl4 + Ge → 2GeCl2It is also formed from the decomposition of chlorogermane, GeH3Cl, at 70 °C. 2 GeH3Cl → GeCl2 + GeH4 + H2 Reactions GeCl2 is hydrolysed to give yellow germanium(II) hydroxide, which on warming gives brown germanium monoxide: GeCl2(aq) + 2H2O(l) <=> Ge(OH)2(s) + 2HCl(aq) Ge(OH)2 → GeO + H2OAlkalizing a solution containing germanium(II) ions: Ge2+(aq) + 2OH−(aq) = Ge(OH)2(s) Germanium oxides and hydroxides are amphoteric. Solutions of GeCl2 in HCl are strongly reducing. With chloride ion, ionic compounds containing the pyramidal GeCl3− ion have been characterised, for example With rubidium and caesium chloride compounds, e.g.RbGeCl3 are produced; these have distorted perovskite structures. Molecular GeCl2, dichlorogermylene Molecular GeCl2 is often called dichlorogermylene, highlighting its resemblance to a carbene. The structure of gas-phase molecular GeCl2 shows that it is a bent molecule, as predicted by VSEPR theory. The dioxane complex, GeCl2.dioxane, has been used as a source of molecular GeCl2 for reaction syntheses, as has
