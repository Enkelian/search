South Berkeley, Berkeley, California
South Berkeley is a neighborhood in the city of Berkeley, California. It extends roughly from Dwight Way to the city’s border with Oakland, between Telegraph Avenue in the east and either Sacramento Street or San Pablo Avenue in the west. It lies at an elevation of 102 feet (31 m). Demographics This neighborhood is the center for Berkeley's African-American community, with a population of 9,341 that is roughly 52% African American. Traditionally, it was considered to be the most economically depressed portion of Berkeley; however, as rent has risen in the city over the past several years, South Berkeley has become more attractive to students and other young people, and rents in the area have become comparable to other, more affluent Berkeley neighborhoods. South Berkeley is crisscrossed by AC Transit bus lines. History South Berkeley is part of the old Rancho San Antonio, approximately 45,000 acres of land granted by Don Pablo Vicente de Sola, Governor of Alta California, in 1820, to Luis Maria Peralta in recognition of his forty years of military service and his work in establishing the missions of Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, and San Jose. In 1842, Peralta divided his land between his four sons. José
