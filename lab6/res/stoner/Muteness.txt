Muteness
Muteness or mutism (from Latin mutus, meaning 'silent') is an inability to speak, often caused by a speech disorder or surgery. Someone who is mute may be so due to the unwillingness to speak in certain social situations. Causes Those who are physically mute may have problems with the parts of the human body required for human speech (vocal cords, lungs, trachea, esophagus, mouth, or tongue, etc.). Trauma or injury to Broca's area, located in the left inferior frontal cortex of the brain, can cause muteness. Variations Selective mutism is an anxiety disorder very common among young children, characterized by the inability to speak in certain situations. It should not be confused with someone who is mute and cannot communicate due to physical disabilities. Selectively mute children are able to communicate in situations in which they feel comfortable. About 90% of children with this disorder have also been diagnosed with social anxiety. It is very common for symptoms to occur before the age of five and do not have a set time period. Not all children express the same symptoms. Some may stand motionless and freeze in specific social settings and have no communication.Alalia is a disorder that refers to
