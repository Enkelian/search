Irish International Exhibition
The Irish International Exhibition (sometimes Dublin International) was a world's fair held in Dublin, Ireland, in 1907, when the country was still part of the United Kingdom. Summary The decision to hold the exhibition was taken at the Irish Industrial Conference in April 1903, and inspired by a small exhibition in Cork (the Cork International Exhibition) 5 years earlier. The 1907 exhibition was intended to improve the trade of Irish goods. The leading force behind the project was William Martin Murphy, a businessman and owner of the Irish Independent, Clerys department store (Clery & Co.), the Dublin United Transport Company and several other Irish and overseas ventures. Other organisers included the Irish journalist William Francis Dennehy. The exposition ran from 4 May to 9 November 1907, received 2.75 million visitors covered 52 acres and made a loss of about Â£100 000 sterling, although this was underwritten by guarantors.As well as contributions from countries including Canada, France and New Zealand there were displays of motor cars, electric and gas lighting and machinery; fine art displays including work by Eva Henrietta Hamilton; funfair amusements; a display depicting life in British Somaliland, the 'Somali village', was the exhibition's most popular attraction.
