Neurokinin A
Neurokinin A (NKA), formerly known as Substance K, is a neurologically active peptide translated from the pre-protachykinin gene. Neurokinin A has many excitatory effects on mammalian nervous systems and is also influential on the mammalian inflammatory and pain responses. Introduction Neurokinin A (formally known as substance K) is a member of the tachykinin family of neuropeptide neurotransmitters. Tachykinins are important contributors to nociceptive processing, satiety, and smooth muscle contraction. Tachykinins are known to be highly excitatory neurotransmitters in major central neural systems. Neurokinin A is ubiquitous in both the central and peripheral mammalian nervous systems, and seems to be involved in reactions to pain and the inflammatory responses. It is produced from the same preprotachykinin A gene as the neuropeptide substance P. Both substance P and neurokinin A are encoded by the same mRNA, which when alternatively spliced can be translated into either compound. It has various roles in the body of humans and other animals, specifically stimulation of extravascular smooth muscle, vasodilation, hypertensive action, immune system activation, and pain management. The deduced amino acid sequence of neurokinin A is as follows: His Lys Asp Ser Phe Val Gly Leu Met (HKTDSFVGLM)with amidation at the C-terminus. Mechanism of action Modified
