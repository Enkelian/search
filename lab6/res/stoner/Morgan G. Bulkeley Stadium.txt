The facility was home to the Eastern League's Hartford Senators, the Hartford Blues of the National Football League, and included a 1/5 mile dirt oval for motor sports. Originally named Clarkin Field from 1921â€“1927, the stadium was renamed for former Connecticut Governor and First President of the National League, Morgan Bulkeley in 1928.James H. Clarkin, owner of the Hartford Senators replaced the old Wethersfield Ave. baseball grounds with the new Clarkin Field in 1921. The site was located at Hanmer Street and George Street off of Franklin Avenue. There was a fine playing surface laid out and Clarkin had erected one of the best minor league structures in the country, with a stand of steel and concrete and dressing rooms, shower baths and complete modern equipment. In 1927 fire destroyed the stand but it was rebuilt in less than a month. After only playing away games during the beginning of the season, the Hartford Senators returned to Hartford for a gala opening of Bulkeley Stadium in July 1927.
