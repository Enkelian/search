BS 5454
BS 5454, "Recommendations for the storage and exhibition of archival documents" was a British Standard for the construction of building repositories for archive collections. It specified security standards, fire resistance, structural qualities for document storage buildings and their locations, environmental parameters (temperature and humidity ranges) designed to protect documents, shelving schemes, and materials for document containers. It was withdrawn in 2012, being replaced by BSI PD 5454:2012 Guide for the Storage and Exhibition of Archival Materials. External links Business Archives Council: Frequently Asked Questions
