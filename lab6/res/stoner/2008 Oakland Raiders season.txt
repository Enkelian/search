2008 Oakland Raiders season
The 2008 Oakland Raiders season was the 49th overall season of the Oakland Raiders franchise, the franchise's 39th season in the National Football League, their 14th season since their return to Oakland and the 2nd and final season under head coach Lane Kiffin. The Raiders improved upon their 4–12 record from 2007. This was also the first time in four seasons that the team did not play both contestants from the previous Super Bowl, playing the New England Patriots, but not the New York Giants. This was also the first time in five seasons the club did not finish 4th in their division but stood alone at third instead (they shared the spot with the Kansas City Chiefs the previous season).
