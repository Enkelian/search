Alice Cooper Goes to Hell
Alice Cooper Goes to Hell is the second solo album by Alice Cooper, released in 1976. A continuation of Welcome to My Nightmare as it continues the story of Steven, this concept album was written almost exclusively by Cooper with guitar player Dick Wagner and producer Bob Ezrin.With the success of “Only Women Bleed” from his first solo effort, Alice continued with the rock ballads on this album. “I Never Cry” was written about his drinking problem, which would in one year send the performer into rehab and affect all his subsequent music up to and including 1983’s DaDa. Cooper called the song “an alcoholic confession”. The “Alice Cooper Goes To Hell” tour of 1976 was completely cancelled prior to commencement due to Cooper suffering from anemia at the time. However, “Go to Hell” proved the last song until his big hit “Poison” to become a consistent part of Cooper’s live setlists, being performed on most tours to the present. “I Never Cry” was also regularly performed in the late 1970s and during the 2000s, whilst “Guilty” was performed regularly on the Flush the Fashion and Special Forces tours and occasionally during the 2000s and “Wish You Were Here” frequently
