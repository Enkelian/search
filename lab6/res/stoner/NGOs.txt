NGOs
Non-governmental organizations (also known as NGOs, or non-government organizations) are organizations that are independent of any government. They are usually non-profit. Many of them are active in humanitarian or social areas. However, NGOs can also be lobby groups for corporations, such as the World Economic Forum.NGOs are a subgroup of all organizations founded by citizens, which include clubs and other associations that provide services, benefits, and premises only to members. Sometimes the term is used as a synonym of "civil society organization" to refer to any association founded by citizens, but this is not how the term is normally used in the media or everyday language, as recorded by major dictionaries. The explanation of the term by NGO.org (the non-governmental organizations associated with the United Nations) is ambivalent: "[an NGO is] any non-profit, voluntary citizens' group which is organized on a local, national or international level," but then goes on to restrict the meaning in the sense used by most English speakers and the media: "Task-oriented and driven by people with a common interest, NGOs perform a variety of service and humanitarian functions, bring citizen concerns to Governments, advocate and monitor policies and encourage political participation through provision of information."NGOs
