Vanadium(III) chloride
Vanadium trichloride is the inorganic compound with the formula VCl3. This purple salt is a common precursor to other vanadium(III) complexes. Structure VCl3 has the common BiI3 structure, a motif that features hexagonally closest-packed chloride framework with vanadium ions occupying the octahedral holes. VBr3 and VI3 adopt the same structure, but VF3 features a structure more closely related to ReO3. VCl3 is paramagnetic and has two unpaired electrons. Preparation and reactions VCl3 is prepared by heating VCl4 at 160–170 °C under a flowing stream of inert gas, which sweeps out the Cl2. The bright red liquid converts to a purple solid. Heating of VCl3 decomposes with volatilization of VCl4, leaving VCl2. Upon heating under H2 at 675 °C (but less than 700 °C), VCl3 reduces to greenish VCl2. 2 VCl3 + H2 → 2 VCl2 + 2 HClComproportionation of vanadium trichloride and vanadium(V) oxides gives vanadium oxydichloride: V2O5 + VOCl3 + 3 VCl3 → 6 VOCl2Vanadium trichloride catalyses the pinacol coupling reaction of benzaldehyde (PhCHO) to 1,2-diphenyl-1,2-ethanediol by various reducing metals such as zinc: Zn + 2 H2O + 2 PhCHO → (PhCH(OH))2 + Zn(OH)2 Complexes VCl3 forms colorful adducts and derivatives with a broad scale of ligands.
