John Prescott
John Leslie Prescott, Baron Prescott (born 31 May 1938) is a British politician who was the Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1997 to 2007 and First Secretary of State from 2001 to 2007. Born in Prestatyn, Wales, he represented Kingston upon Hull East as the Labour Member of Parliament (MP) from 1970 to 2010. In the 1994 leadership election, he stood for both Leader and Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, winning election to the latter office. He was appointed Deputy Prime Minister after Labour's victory in the 1997 election, with an expanded brief as Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions. A former ship's steward and trade union activist, by the 1990s he was presented as the political link to the working class in a Labour party increasingly led by modernising, middle-class professionals such as Tony Blair and Peter Mandelson. In his youth he failed the eleven-plus exam entrance examination for grammar school, but went on to graduate from Ruskin College and the University of Hull. Prescott also developed a reputation as a key conciliator in the often stormy relationship between Prime Minister Tony Blair and Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown. On
