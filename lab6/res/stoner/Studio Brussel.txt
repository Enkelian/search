Studio Brussel
Studio Brussel (Studio Brussels) (often shortened StuBru) is a Dutch-speaking radio station in Belgium, owned by the VRT. The music played is considered more alternative than the other big radio stations, and is aimed mainly at a youth audience. The channel is an initiative of the Flemish Government and is financed principally by taxes. History Studio Brussel started on 1 April 1983 as a regional Brussels radio station of the then-BRT. It began as a regional radio station broadcasting only during rush hour. Gradually, broadcasting times were expanded and Studio Brussel could be heard throughout all of Flanders. The first two presenters were Paul De Wyngaert and Jan Hautekiet. The radio station plays mostly alternative and more heavy music, mostly rock, but also metal, hiphop, house and techno. At the end of 2002, Studio Brussel got a new look. The logo with the "wild" characters was replaced by a red ellipse with the name Studio Brussel in it. On 24 April 2006, Wim Oosterlinck left Studio Brussel for Qmusic. Peter Van de Veire left Studio Brussel for the new radio station MNM in 2008. Since 2007, Jan Van Biesen is the net manager of Studio Brussel. He was preceded by
