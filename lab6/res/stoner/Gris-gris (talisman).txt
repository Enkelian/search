Gris-gris (talisman)
Gris-gris GREE-gree, also spelled grigri, and sometimes also "gregory" or "gerregery", is a Voodoo amulet originating in Africa which is believed to protect the wearer from evil or bring luck, and in some West African countries is used as a method of birth control. It consists of a small cloth bag, usually inscribed with verses from the Qur'an and containing a ritual number of small objects, worn on the person. Etymology Although the exact origins of the word are unknown, some historians trace the word back to the Yoruba word juju meaning fetish. An alternative theory is that the word originates with the French joujou meaning doll or play-thing. It has otherwise been attributed in scholarly sources to the Mandingo word meaning "magic." History The gris-gris originated in Dagomba in Ghana and was associated with Islamic traditions. Originally the gris-gris was adorned with Islamic scripture and was used to ward off evil spirits (evil djinn) or bad luck. Historians of the time noted that they were frequently worn by non-believers and believers alike, and were also found attached to buildings.The practice of using gris-gris, though originating in Africa, came to the United States with enslaved Africans and was quickly adopted
