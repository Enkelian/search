History The channel was originally launched on 1 October 2002 by CSC Media Group as Toons and Tunes. The channel was then later re-branded as Pop on 23 May 2003; the logo has been rendered in different forms, including all upper-case or all lower-case, along with an exclamation point at the end. In the channel's early years, links were presented by Rorry, a lime green dragon with a Scottish accent (who had appeared in an ITV Saturday Morning programme in Autumn 1997 under the name Tricky and spoke with an English accent) who was animated live. He was accompanied by Purrdy, a dragon/cat hybrid who also appeared in original the Tricky programme on ITV. Originally, the network focused on music videos, with animated programming also part of the schedule, but with the numerous music video network options on British television at the time, this focus was quickly abandoned around 2004, when the animated content became much more prominent. Music videos continued to be carried on and off until 2007, before eventually being abandoned entirely. Programming The network
