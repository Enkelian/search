Fuzzy Door Productions
Fuzzy Door (formally known as Fuzzy Door Productions) is the production company of actor and producer Seth MacFarlane, established in 1998. The company's productions include the animated series Family Guy, American Dad!, the Family Guy spin-off The Cleveland Show, the live-action sitcom The Winner, the science documentary series Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey and the sci-fi comedy series The Orville. The name of the company comes from the leopard-printed fake fur-covered door to the house MacFarlane lived in when he was attending Rhode Island School of Design as an undergraduate in animation. The house itself also went by the nickname The Fuzzy Door during MacFarlane's residence and was the location of many "Fuzzy Door" parties. The Fuzzy Door Productions logo was designed by Cory Brookes, a friend and housemate of Seth's at the Fuzzy Door residence. However, the logo was updated in 2019, featuring a more abstract design of the door, and no longer featuring the fur-pattern design, instead being colored a plain white color, with a blue background. The updated logo made its on-screen debut on November 10th of that year, with the Family Guy episode "Peter and Lois' Wedding". Series Television series Web series Films Shorts Discography No One
