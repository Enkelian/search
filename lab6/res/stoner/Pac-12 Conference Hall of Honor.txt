Pac-12 Conference Hall of Honor
The Pac-12 Conference Hall of Honor recognizes former athletes and coaches who have made a significant impact to the tradition and heritage of the Pac-12 Conference. Established in 2002, one honoree is selected by each member institution in the conference annually. The inductions occur during the Pac-12 Conference Men's Basketball Tournament. The Hall of Honor was originally limited to men's basketball, until it was opened to other sports in 2018. The conference was named the Pacific-10 before it expanded in the 2011â€“12 season with Colorado and Utah.
