Bachman–Turner Overdrive (1973 album)
Bachman–Turner Overdrive is the self-titled debut album by Canadian rock band Bachman–Turner Overdrive, released in 1973. It was originally to be titled Brave Belt III, as Brave Belt was the name of the group before they became Bachman–Turner Overdrive. Although this album did not produce a true hit single ("Blue Collar" only managed to reach #68 on the U.S. Billboard charts), it was certified "Gold" by the RIAA in 1974, largely pulled up by strong sales of BTO's two subsequent albums (Bachman–Turner Overdrive II and Not Fragile). In later years, this first album was often referred to as "BTO 1" to distinguish it from the band's follow-up second album.
