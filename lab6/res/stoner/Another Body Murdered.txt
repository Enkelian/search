Another Body Murdered
"Another Body Murdered" is a song created as a collaboration between Faith No More and Boo-Yaa T.R.I.B.E. for the soundtrack to the 1993 film Judgment Night. It was released as a single on October 25, 1993. It was the first recording by Faith No More to not include guitarist Jim Martin, despite still being a member of the band at the time. Bassist Billy Gould performed guitar on the song instead. The music video was directed by Marcus Raboy. Despite charting in a few countries and being released as a single, this song has never been re-released on any Faith No More compilation albums. Professional wrestler Samoa Joe has used the song as an entrance theme in the past.
