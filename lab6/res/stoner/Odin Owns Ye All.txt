Odin Owns Ye All
Odin Owns Ye All is the second full-length album by the Norwegian Viking metal band Einherjer. Its songs form a brief, but complete, narrative of the earth based on Norse mythology. The opening tracks tell the story of the giant Ymir, his death at the hands of Odin and his brothers, and the creation of the world. The later tracks tell of the murder of Balder that precipitates Ragnarok, followed by the destruction of the world and its rebirth from the sea. The album cover art is the painting “Odin and His Ravens” by Alan Lee.
