Phosphorus pentachloride
Phosphorus pentachloride is the chemical compound with the formula PCl5. It is one of the most important phosphorus chlorides, others being PCl3 and POCl3. PCl5 finds use as a chlorinating reagent. It is a colourless, water-sensitive and moisture-sensitive solid, although commercial samples can be yellowish and contaminated with hydrogen chloride. Structure The structures for the phosphorus chlorides are invariably consistent with VSEPR theory. The structure of PCl5 depends on its environment. Gaseous and molten PCl5 is a neutral molecule with trigonal bipyramidal geometry and (D3h) symmetry. The hypervalent nature of this species (as well as for PCl−6, see below) can be explained with the inclusion of non-bonding molecular orbitals (molecular orbital theory) or resonance (valence bond theory). This trigonal bipyramidal structure persists in nonpolar solvents, such as CS2 and CCl4. In the solid state PCl5 is an ionic compound, formulated PCl+4PCl−6. In solutions of polar solvents, PCl5 undergoes self-ionization. Dilute solutions dissociate according to the following equilibrium: PCl5 ⇌ PCl+4 + Cl−At higher concentrations, a second equilibrium becomes more prevalent: 2 PCl5 ⇌ PCl+4 + PCl−6The cation PCl+4 and the anion PCl−6 are tetrahedral and octahedral, respectively. At one time, PCl5 in solution was thought to form a dimeric structure,
