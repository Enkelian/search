Initially, the park featured six islands. A seventh, The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, was added in 2010, themed to the highly-successful Harry Potter franchise. It was Universal's largest investment since the resort's founding in 1990.

The eighth island, Skull Island, opened on July 13, 2016 and is themed to the King Kong franchise.
