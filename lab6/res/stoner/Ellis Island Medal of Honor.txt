Ellis Island Medal of Honor
The Ellis Island Medal of Honor is an American award founded by the Ellis Island Honors Society (EIHS) (formerly known as National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations (NECO) ) which are presented annually to American citizens, both native-born and naturalized. The Medal recognizes — in the organization's words — individuals who have made it their mission to share with those less fortunate, their wealth of knowledge, indomitable courage, boundless compassion, unique talents and selfless generosity. They do so while acknowledging their debt to their ethnic heritage as they uphold the ideals and spirit of America. Past medalists include seven U.S. presidents, several world leaders, several Nobel Prize winners, and other leaders of industry, education, the arts, sports and government, along with everyday Americans. Process EIHS was founded in 1984, and the medals were established in 1986; a ceremony is held each May on Ellis Island. All branches of the United States Armed Forces traditionally participate. Both the United States House of Representatives and United States Senate have officially recognized the Ellis Island Medals of Honor, and each year's recipients are read into the Congressional Record. The Ellis Island's Great Hall where immigrants were once processed hosts the gala dinner and ceremony.
