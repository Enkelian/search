Bromine monochloride
Bromine monochloride, also called bromine(I) chloride, bromochloride, and bromine chloride, is an interhalogen inorganic compound with chemical formula BrCl. It is a very reactive golden yellow gas with boiling point 5 °C and melting point −66 °C. Its CAS number is 13863-41-7 and its EINECS number is 237-601-4. It is a strong oxidizing agent. Uses Bromine monochloride is used in analytical chemistry in determining low levels of mercury, to quantitatively oxidize mercury in the sample to Hg(II) state. Bromine monochloride is used as a biocide, specifically as an algaecide, fungicide, and disinfectant, in industrial recirculating cooling water systems. Addition of bromine monochloride is used in some types of Li-SO2 batteries to increase voltage and energy density. See also List of highly toxic gases == References ==
