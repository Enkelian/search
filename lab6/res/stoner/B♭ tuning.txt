B♭ tuning
B♭ tuning, or A♯ tuning, is a method of guitar tuning (and stringed instruments per se) in which all strings on a six-stringed instrument, most often guitar, are tuned down by 3 steps. For example, standard guitar tuning is E A D G B E. B♭ tuning starts by tuning the lowest string on a guitar E, to B♭ and then tuning all strings down in the same interval of 3 steps down. Strings on a guitar tuned to B♭ are B♭ E♭ A♭ D♭ F B♭ Seven-string guitars achieve B and B♭ tuning because they have a lower B string below the E string, which is the lowest string on a conventional guitar. Used by Adema on most of their eponymous album and Unstable. Alter Bridge (similar to six-string E-flat tuning, but the lowest string is tuned down to B-flat) American Head Charge Arch Enemy (on some songs, those songs are tuned to A tuning in live performances) Behemoth (7 string guitars) Boris (also with 6th string dropped to G# and D# on some tracks) Brian "Head" Welch on his debut solo album Save Me from Myself, as well as with Korn on their demo "Neidermayer's Mind".
