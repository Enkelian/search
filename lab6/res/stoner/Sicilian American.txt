Sicilian American
Sicilian Americans (Italian: Siculoamericani; Sicilian: Siculu-miricani) are Americans of Sicilian birth or ancestry. They are one of the largest and most prominent Italian American groups in the United States. While being a subset of Italian Americans, the Sicilian Americans are often considered a separate group in the US, owing to some cultural and historical characteristics. History Sicilian emigration to the US grew substantially istarting in the 1880s to 1914, when it was cut off by the World War. Many Sicilians and plan to return home after a few years making money in the United States, but the wartime delay allowed many to assimilate into better jobs and wartime experience, so they did not return. By 1924 about 4,000,000 Sicilians emigrated to the US, And several million returned.. The Emergency Quota Act, and the subsequent Immigration Act of 1924 sharply reduced immigration from Southern Europe except for relatives of Sicilians already in the U.S. This period saw political and economic shifts in Sicily that made emigration desirable. There was also a large wave of immigration after World War II. A great portion of the Sicilian immigrants would settle in New York City, New Haven, Buffalo, Rochester, Erie, Tampa, Pittsburgh, Chicago, Boston,
