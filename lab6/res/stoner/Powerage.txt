Powerage
Powerage is the fifth studio album by Australian hard rock band AC/DC. It was the band's fourth studio album released internationally and the fifth to be released in Australia. It was the first AC/DC album to feature Cliff Williams on bass, and it was also the first AC/DC album not to have a title track (aside from the Australia-only High Voltage album). Powerage was re-released in 2003 as part of the AC/DC Remasters series. Background After a 12-date European tour opening for Black Sabbath in April, bassist Mark Evans was fired from AC/DC on 3 May 1977. In the AC/DC memoir AC/DC: Maximum Rock & Roll, former manager Michael Browning states, "I got a call one day from Malcolm and Angus. We were in London, I went to their apartment and they told me they wanted to get rid of Mark. Him and Angus didn't see eye to eye. They used to have a sort of tit-for-tat thing going, but nothing that I would have ever thought was going to be gig-threatening." According to Browning, the Young brothers were seriously considering Colin Pattenden of Manfred Mann fame. Browning feared that Pattenden was too old and didn't fit the band's image,
