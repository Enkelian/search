Hollow Ground (band)
Hollow Ground were an English heavy metal band. Biography Formed in the North East of England in the late 1970s, Hollow Ground became one of the cutting edge groups of the NWOBHM period. Although they only released six tracks, these have come to be considered a classic example of the style of the era. In 1980 they released the Warlord EP, containing the tracks "Flying high," "Warlord," "Rock on", and "Don't chase the dragon." This 7-inch record is difficult to find and now changes hands for Â£200 in mint condition. Later in 1980, a further two tracks ("Fight with the devil" and "The holy one") were recorded and were used along with "Rock on" and "Flying high" on the Roksnax split album. Four more tracks were recorded, "Rock to love", "Promised land," "Easy action", and "Loser", but were never released. In 1990 the track "Fight with the devil" was included on the Lars Ulrich/Geoff Barton compilation album NWOBHM '79 Revisited. The original Warlord EP tracks can also be found on the compilation CD Rare Metal: N.W.O.B.H.M. Metal Rarities, Volume 1. Singer Glenn Coates left Hollow Ground to join Fist in 1982 for their Back With A Vengeance album. This defection
