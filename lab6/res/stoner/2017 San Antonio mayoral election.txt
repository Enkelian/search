2017 San Antonio mayoral election
On May 6, 2017, the city of San Antonio, Texas held an election to choose the next mayor of San Antonio. As no candidate secured a majority of the vote (50% of all votes cast +1), a runoff was held on June 10, 2017 with Councilman Ron Nirenberg defeating incumbent mayor Ivy Taylor. Simultaneous elections to the city council as well as various area bond programs were held on the same date. Background Julian Castro, who was elected mayor in the 2009 San Antonio mayoral election, resigned in 2014 to become the United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Ivy Taylor was selected by the San Antonio City Council as Castro's successor. Taylor successfully ran for re-election as mayor in the 2015 San Antonio mayoral election. On November 13, 2016, Taylor officially announced her candidacy for a second full term as mayor. City Councilman Ron Nirenberg became the first challenger to Taylor, announcing his candidacy on December 10, 2016. The chairman of the Bexar County Democratic Party, Manuel Medina, announced his candidacy on January 7, 2017. District 4 City Councilman Rey Salda√±a, a potential candidate, opted to run for a fourth term to the city council rather than mayor.
