Charity Girl
Charity Girl is a Regency romance novel by Georgette Heyer, first published in 1970. Plot summary Charity Girl revolves around the character of the wealthy, athletic Viscount Ashley Desford and his mission to save "charity girl" Charity Steane from a life with her uncaring relatives. The novel also takes up the Viscountâ€™s friendship with Henrietta Silverdale, his neighbour and childhood friend. The narrative opens on a conversation between the Viscount and his father, the Earl of Wroxton. Wroxton asks Desford to look into the affairs of his younger brother Simon. Wroxton fears that Simon has fallen into bad company and will destroy his reputation. Desford declines to interfere in Simon's doings, saying that the last person Simon is likely to listen to is his older brother. In the same conversation, Wroxton also reproaches Desford for having failed to marry Henrietta nine years ago. Desford protests that, while he loves Henrietta as a sister, there is no passion between them and that she cared to marry him as little as he cared to marry her. Later in the novel, it emerges that, at that time, Henrietta had begged Desford not to propose marriage to her, even though it was the wish
