Dead Skeletons
Dead Skeletons are a psychedelic rock trio from Reykjavík, Iceland, formed in 2008 by Jón Sæmundur Auðarson (aka Nonni Dead), Henrik Björnsson and Ryan Carlson Van Kriedt. History Dead Skeletons formed in 2008 when frontman Auðarson held a show at the Reykjavik Art Museum. He needed music to accompany the installation, so Auðarson, Björnsson (also of Singapore Sling) and Van Kriedt (ex-Sunsplit, also of Asteroid #4) recorded the song "Dead Mantra", which became an underground hit and landed them a record deal with A Records, who released it as a single on 26 November 2010. Their debut album, Dead Magick, was released on 11 November 2011, followed by three 2012 releases: the "Om Mani Peme Hung" single in January (by Too Pure), the (Orð) EP on 23 September (by Sound of Cobra) and a two-track single titled Buddha-Christ on 12 December (by Fuzz Club Records). Another two-track single, "Dead Comet", was released in November 2013 by Dead Monk Records. Dead Skeletons were invited to perform at the All Tomorrow's Parties Iceland festival in June 2013 at Ásbrú, Naval Air Station Keflavik,Auðarson's longtime HIV-positive status and resulting fear of death are a major influence on the band's ethos.
