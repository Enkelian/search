Merchants of Light
Merchants of Light is the second live offering by Big Big Train and is based on the autumn 2017 Concerts at Cadogan Hall, London. It was recorded across three dates 29, 30 September and 1 October 2017, then first released on 27 July 2018. The setlist is made up of 16 tracks and these are drawn from the latest four albums of the band, The Underfall Yard, English Electric, Folklore and Grimspound. The release of the 2 CD album was preceded by a single of the track "Swan Hunter" a few days before the full live album. Reaction The three scheduled shows again sold out. The review rather effusively states that the shows and recording is full of brilliant photos, a perfect setlist and spectacular sound Track listing Disc one Disc two Musicians David Longdon - Vocals, Flute, Percussion Greg Spawton - Bass Guitar Nick D’Virgilio - Drums, Percussion, Vocals Danny Manners - Keyboards Andy Poole - Keyboards, Guitar Dave Gregory - Guitar Rikard Sjöblom - Guitar, Keyboards, Vocals Rachel Hall - Violin, Vocalswith Dave Desmond - Trombone Ben Godfrey - Trumpet Nick Stones - French Horn John Storey - Euphonium Jon Truscott - Tuba References External links "Bigbigtrain.com Discography
