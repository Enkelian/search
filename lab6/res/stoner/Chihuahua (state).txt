Chihuahua (state)
Chihuahua (Spanish pronunciation: [tʃiˈwawa] (listen)), officially the Estado Libre y Soberano de Chihuahua (English: Free and Sovereign State of Chihuahua) (Tepehuán: ?), is one of the 32 states which comprise the 32 Federal Entities of Mexico. It is located in Northwestern Mexico and is bordered by the states of Sonora to the west, Sinaloa to the southwest, Durango to the south, and Coahuila to the east. To the north and northeast, it has a long border with the U.S. adjacent to the U.S. states of New Mexico and Texas. Its capital city is Chihuahua City.
