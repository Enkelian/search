Drimnagh Castle Secondary School
Drimnagh Castle Secondary School (Irish: Meánscoil Iognáid Rís) is a Christian Brothers secondary school located on the Long Mile Road in the suburb of Drimnagh, Dublin, Ireland. The school buildings are situated directly beside the old Norman castle, Drimnagh Castle, from which the school takes its name. History Drimnagh Castle Secondary School first opened its doors in 1954. For a short time after the school opened, classes took place in the castle itself, until the current buildings were completed at a cost of £84,000.
