Akuammine
Akuammine (vincamajoridine) is an indole alkaloid. It is the most abundant alkaloid found in the seeds from the tree Picralima nitida, commonly known as akuamma, comprising 0.56% of the dried powder. It has also been isolated from Vinca major. Akuammine is structurally related to both yohimbine and mitragynine, both of which are alkaloid plant products with pharmacological properties. Pharmacology Akuammine has antimalarial activity, and may be the primary constituent of P. nitida seeds responsible for this activity.Akuammine is an opioid antagonist with low affinity, selective for the mu-opioid receptor, when tested in vitro. == References ==
