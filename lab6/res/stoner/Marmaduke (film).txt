Marmaduke (film)
Marmaduke is a 2010 American live action film adaptation of Brad Anderson's comic strip of the same name. The film centers on a rural Kansas family and their pets; a Great Dane named Marmaduke (voiced by Owen Wilson), and his best friend, a Balinese cat named Carlos (voiced by George Lopez); as the family relocates to California. The film was released on June 4, 2010 and was met with largely negative reviews. Plot Marmaduke (Owen Wilson) is a Great Dane, living in rural Kansas with his best friend who is a cat named Carlos (George Lopez). His owner, Phil (Lee Pace), works for Bark Organic dog food. Phil is very strict, from Marmaduke's perspective. One day, Carlos tells Marmaduke that he overheard Phil saying that they were being transferred to Orange County. Later, Marmaduke meets a rough collie named Jezebel, whose boyfriend is Bosco, a violent Beauceron with two Miniature Pinscher minions named Thunder and Lightning. Bosco intimidates Marmaduke, who does not want to fight. Marmaduke and the mutts get together at night and crash Bosco's pedigrees-only party, only to be scared away. Marmaduke asks Mazie to help him get a girl, whom she presumes is herself but is Jezebel.
