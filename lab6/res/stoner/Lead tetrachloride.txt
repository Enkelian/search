Lead tetrachloride
Lead tetrachloride, also known as lead(IV) chloride, has the molecular formula PbCl4. It is a yellow, oily liquid which is stable below 0 °C, and decomposes at 50 °C. It has a tetrahedral configuration, with lead as the central atom. The Pb–Cl covalent bonds have been measured to be 247 pm and the bond energy is 243 kJ⋅mol−1. Synthesis Lead tetrachloride can be made by reacting lead(II) chloride PbCl2, and hydrochloric acid HCl, in the presence of chlorine gas (Cl2), leading to the formation of chloroplumbic acid H2PbCl6. It is then converted to the ammonium salt (NH4)2PbCl6 by adding ammonium chloride (NH4Cl). Finally, the solution is treated with concentrated sulfuric acid H2SO4, to separate out lead tetrachloride. This series of reactions is conducted at 0 °C. The following equations illustrate the reaction: PbCl2 + 2HCl + Cl2 → H2PbCl6 H2PbCl6 + 2 NH4Cl → (NH4)2PbCl6 + 2HCl (NH4)2PbCl6 + H2SO4 → PbCl4+ 2HCl + (NH4)2SO4 Reaction with water Unlike carbon tetrachloride, another group IV (IUPAC: group 14) chloride, lead tetrachloride reacts with water. This is because the central atom is bigger (Pb is bigger than C) so there is less cluttering and water can easily access it. Also, because of
