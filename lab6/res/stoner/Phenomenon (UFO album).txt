Phenomenon (UFO album)
Phenomenon is the third studio album by the British rock band UFO, released in May 1974. Production This was their third studio album and their debut on Chrysalis. UFO largely left their blues-based "space rock" sound behind, in part due to the presence of their new guitarist, German 19-year-old Michael Schenker. The album was produced by Leo Lyons, bass guitarist of British rock group Ten Years After. All tracks were recorded at Morgan Studios in London. The original cover design and photos were produced by Hipgnosis. It was remastered at Sound Recording Technology, Cambridge, in 1994. Influence The British heavy metal band Iron Maiden performed a cover of "Doctor Doctor" when Blaze Bayley was with the band as their vocalist. Iron Maiden's cover version is included in "Lord of the Flies" single and also in the Eddie's Archive boxed set on the "Best of the B-Sides" collection. Traditionally, Iron Maiden uses the UFO live version, played over the venue PA system, to signal the audience that they are about to take the stage. Track listing All tracks are written by Michael Schenker and Phil Mogg, except where noted. Personnel UFOPhil Mogg – vocals Michael Schenker – guitar Pete Way –
