He states near the beginning of Dē Nātūra Deōrum that he wrote them both as a relief from the political inactivity to which he was reduced by the supremacy of Julius Caesar, and as a distraction from the grief caused by the death of his daughter Tullia.The dialogue is supposed to take place in Rome at the house of Gaius Aurelius Cotta.
