Dynamic deconstructive psychotherapy
Dynamic deconstructive psychotherapy (DDP) is a manual-based treatment for borderline personality disorder. Goals The goals of DDP are: (1) connecting with oneâ€™s own emotional experiences in order to develop an integrated sense of self and (2) connecting with others in more authentic ways, so as to improve the quality of relationships. Focus of treatment The primary focus of treatment is on recent social interactions. Three sets of techniques are employed: Association, Attribution, and Alterity. With Association techniques, the therapist helps the client to develop a narrative sequence of a given interaction and to identify emotions that the client may have experienced. With Attribution techniques, the therapist helps the client to examine alternative ways to interpret the interaction, thereby deconstructing rigid, polarized attributions towards self and other, and opening up new and more complex perspectives. With Alterity techniques, the therapist provides deconstructive experiences within the therapist-client relationship that support individuation and help to experientially deconstruct rigid, polarized attributions. Treatment procedure DDP is offered on a weekly basis in 45-50 minute sessions. Between sessions, clients are encouraged to work on connecting to their emotional experiences using Daily Connection Sheets, and to attempt to develop more authentic and individuated relationships outside of treatment.
