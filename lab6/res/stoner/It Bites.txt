It Bites
It Bites are an English progressive rock and pop fusion band, formed in Egremont, Cumbria, England, in 1982 and best known for their 1986 single "Calling All the Heroes", which gained them a Top 10 UK Singles Chart hit. Initially fronted by Francis Dunnery, the band split in 1990, eventually returning in 2006 with new frontman John Mitchell. This lineup toured and produced two further albums plus two live albums. By May 2019, confusion emerged surrounding the future of the band: while drummer Bob Dalton stated the band will no longer write/record or play live, frontman John Mitchell said that both he and keyboard player John Beck are writing new material and were not consulted about the split, only finding out through social media. Musical style Described as having "a strong art-rock tendency" by AllMusic, website Über Rock stated, "It Bites have always been one of the more curious cases of the progressive rock world. Their first impression on us back in the 1980s was that of a pop band. But a pop band doing what no pop band had the right to do – successfully mix catchy tunes with complex musicianship and, god forbid, distorted guitars."The band's musical development
