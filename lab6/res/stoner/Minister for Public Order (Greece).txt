The Ministry of Citizen Protection (Greek: Υπουργείο Προστασίας του Πολίτη) is the government department responsible for Greece's public security services, i.e. the Hellenic Police, the Hellenic Fire Service, the Hellenic Coast Guard, the Agrarian Police and the General Secretariat for Civil Protection. The ministry existed until 2007 as the Ministry of Public Order (Greek: Υπουργείο Δημόσιας Τάξης). On 19 September 2007, it was merged with the Ministry of the Interior, Public Administration and Decentralization and reduced to a General Secretariat within the Ministry of the Interior. On 7 October 2009, it was revived as the Ministry of Citizen Protection (Υπουργείο Προστασίας του Πολίτη) and was eventually renamed as the Ministry of Public Order and Citizen Protection on 21 June 2012. Following the electoral victory of Syriza in January 2015, it was subordinated to the Ministry of the Interior and Administrative Reconstruction and was headed by an Alternate Minister (Αναπληρωτής Υπουργός). In August 2018, it was reorganized as an independent ministry and was revived as the Ministry of Citizen Protection (Υπουργείο Προστασίας του Πολίτη). The present incumbent is Michalis Chrisochoidis.
