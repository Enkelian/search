Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences
Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences, formerly Karunya University, is a private residential institute deemed to be university in Coimbatore, India. It was founded by D. G. S. Dhinakaran and his son Paul Dhinakaran. Accreditation Karunya University was accredited in 2014 by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) with an "A" grade. Rankings The university was ranked 89 among universities in India by the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) in 2018, in the 101â€“150 band overall and 72 in the engineering rankings. Controversy In November 2017, Karunya was ordered to close two off-campus centres in Periyanaickenpalayam and Lakshmi Mills, which were opened without permission. In addition, a letter from the UGC showed that Karunya has not renewed its deemed-to-be-university status, which as expired in 2007. The institute has agreed to close the centres, leaving 750 students to find other solutions, since the courses they were pursuing, management, science and social science courses, are not offered at Karunya's main campus. The UGC had also formed a committee of experts to inspect the institution. Acting on the recommendations of said committee, in June 2018 an extension to the deemed-to-be-university status was granted for a period of five years. References External links
