Dick in a Box
"Dick in a Box" is the debut single by American comedy troupe the Lonely Island, featuring singer Justin Timberlake. The song and music video debuted on Saturday Night Live as an SNL Digital Short on December 16, 2006. The video depicts two early-1990s R&B ballad singers Andy (Andy Samberg) and Raif (Timberlake) crooning a holiday song about making a gift for their girlfriends of their penises wrapped in boxes (strategically placed) topped with bows. The song originated from Saturday Night Live executive producer Lorne Michaels, who asked Samberg to write a track to showcase Timberlake's singing abilities. "Dick in a Box" was recorded in one night, while its corresponding music video was filmed the following day. After being screened by NBC executives for content, the short debuted less than a few hours later. In its original network airing, the word "dick", a recurring word in the chorus, was bleeped 16 times. Saturday Night Live producers made the decision to publish the uncensored version of the short online after its broadcast debut under the titles “Special Treat in a Box” or “Special Christmas Box”. Like its predecessor, "Lazy Sunday", "Dick in a Box" became a major viral hit on the Internet.
