Quebec City Summer Festival
Festival d'été de Québec (FEQ) is the biggest outdoor musical event in Canada. Held since 1968 in Québec City, the 11-day festival takes place every year in July. FEQ's eclectic programming includes the biggest international stars and emerging artists from around the globe. Its main stage is the biggest self-supporting stage in North America. Festival d’été de Québec is presented by Bell in collaboration with Coors Light. The 53rd edition of the FEQ will take place from July 8 to 18, 2021. History The festival has been taking place annually since 1968. First editions were organized by a group of businesspersons and artists of Quebec City in order to show the artistic, economic, and tourist potential of the region. During the 1970s and 1980s, the festival specialized in musicians from the Francophonie and world music. The festival grew substantially during the last decade after its decision to diversify its music offering and go after international headliners from genres across the board, including rock music, punk, hip-hop, classical music, world music and electronic music. The festival reached the million spectators mark for the first time in 2007 and sold-out passes for the first time in 2010. Setting The outdoor venues :
