ITV Lunchtime News
The ITV Lunchtime News is the afternoon news programme produced by ITN on the British television network ITV. It broadcasts for twenty-five minutes each Monday to Friday from 13:30, covering British national and international news stories and is presented by Nina Hossain. History Television broadcasting hours in the United Kingdom had been tightly regulated and controlled by the British government until 1972, when the then Conservative government under Prime Minister Edward Heath decided to end all limits and restrictions on the broadcasting hours of television. ITV had been campaigning for the end of the restrictions since the mid 1960s, and finally on 19 January 1972, the government announced the lifting of all restrictions, allowing proper daytime television to launch on both the BBC and ITV.ITN had provided a short lunchtime news summary to start the ITV schedules on a Saturday since 1959, with an afternoon news summary on a Sunday starting in the mid 1960s, however it was the lifting of the restrictions in 16 October 1972 which helped ITN to launch a codified, more solid weekday lunchtime news programme as part of a raft of new programming which would now take up broadcasting hours which were up to 1972
