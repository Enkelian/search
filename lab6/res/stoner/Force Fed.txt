Force Fed
Force Fed is the debut album by the band Prong. Although the album was recorded from January to July 1987, it was not released until early 1989, due to label problems. The CD version included two bonus tracks, the cover of Chrome's "Third from the Sun" and "Mind the Gap", originally taken from the band's 1989 EP Third from the Sun (also known as 3). Although the EP is no longer available, Prong still regularly performs the song "Third from the Sun", though it is actually a cover of a song originally by Chrome. Drummer Ted Parsons co-wrote some of the songs for the first time.
