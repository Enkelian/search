Jonny Buckland
Jonathan Mark Buckland (born 11 September 1977) is an English musician and multi-instrumentalist. He is the lead guitarist and co-founder of the alternative rock band Coldplay. Early life Jonathan Mark Buckland was born on 11 September 1977 in Islington, London. He lived there until the age of four, when his family moved to Pantymwyn in Flintshire, Wales. Buckland started playing the guitar at the age of eleven, inspired by The Stone Roses, Ride, George Harrison, U2, and My Bloody Valentine, and also encouraged by his older brother Tim. He was a student at Ysgol y Waun and Alun School, the latter located in the Welsh town of Mold. He went on to study astronomy and mathematics at University College London, where he met future bandmates Chris Martin, Guy Berryman, and Will Champion, as well as their future manager Phil Harvey, and formed Coldplay. Buckland is noted for his sparse arrangements and use of slide. His stylistic chiming and ringing sound have led to some comparisons with the playing of U2's The Edge. Solo work Buckland has guest starred on Ian McCulloch's solo album Slideling and made a cameo appearance with bandmate Chris Martin in the film Shaun of the Dead.
