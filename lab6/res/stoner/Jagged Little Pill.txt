Jagged Little Pill
Jagged Little Pill is the third studio album, and international debut, by Canadian singer Alanis Morissette, released on June 13, 1995, through Maverick. It was her first album to be released worldwide as her first two albums were released only in Canada. The album was a stylistic departure from her first two albums, which featured a new jack swing and dance-pop musical style. Morissette began work on the album after moving from her hometown, Ottawa, to Toronto; she made little progress until she traveled to Los Angeles, where she met producer Glen Ballard. Morissette and Ballard had an instant connection and began co-writing and experimenting with sounds. The experimentation resulted in an alternative rock album that takes influence from post-grunge and pop rock, and features guitars, keyboards, drum machines, and harmonica. The lyrics touch upon themes of aggression and unsuccessful relationships, while Ballard introduced a pop sensibility to Morissette's angst.Jagged Little Pill topped the charts in thirteen countries; with sales of over 33 million copies worldwide, it is one of the best-selling albums of all time and made Morissette the first Canadian to achieve double diamond sales. Jagged Little Pill was nominated for nine Grammy Awards, winning five, including Album
