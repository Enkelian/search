Government of Belgium
The Federal Government of Belgium (Dutch: Federale regering, French: Gouvernement fédéral, German: Föderalregierung) exercises executive power in the Kingdom of Belgium. It consists of ministers and secretaries of state ("junior", or deputy-ministers who do not sit in the Council of Ministers) drawn from the political parties which form the governing coalition. The federal government is led by the Prime Minister of Belgium, and Ministers lead ministries of the government. Ministers together form the Council of Ministers, which is the supreme executive organ of the Government (equivalent to a cabinet). Formally, executive power is vested in the King, who formally appoints the ministers. However, under the Constitution of Belgium, the King is not politically responsible for exercising his powers, and his acts must be countersigned by a minister. Thus, in practice, the ministers do the actual day-to-day work of governing. Function and composition At the federal level, executive power is wielded by the Federal Government, whilst the Prime Minister is the head of the government. Each minister heads a ministry, and secretaries of state, who are deputy to a minister, help run these ministries. The government reflects the weight of political parties that constitute the current governing coalition for the Chamber.
