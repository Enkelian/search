Asaruludu
In Sumerian and Akkadian mythology Asaruludu is one of the Anunnaki. His name is also spelled Asarludu, Asarluhi, and Namshub.

The Enuma Elish describes Asaruludu as "the light of the gods". Another version states he is "the wielder of the flaming sword" and "ensures the most perfect safety". History Early evidence does not associate Asaruludu with incantations and magic, but rather with the city of Kuara.

Sometimes Asalluhi plays an intermediary role, introducing the patient to Enki/Ea.Later texts describe Asaruludu as the son of Enki/Ea, who shares Enki/Ea's qualities of intelligence, counsel and "wide reason", as well as expertise in incantations. Asaraludu often bears the epithets "son of Eridu" or the "son of Abzu," Enki/Ea's realm of subterranean waters.Asaruludu was later syncretized with Marduk; in the Enuma Elish, Asalluhi is one of Marduk's fifty names.
