It is awarded annually to a person not over thirty-five for a technical paper of exceptional merit, published in one of the journals of the participating societies.Established in 1929 in honor of Alfred Noble (1844-1914), past president of the American Society of Civil Engineers, the prize was first awarded in 1931. There have been several notable winners of this prize including Claude E. Shannon in 1939. It has no connection to the Nobel Prize established by Alfred Nobel, with which this award is often confused owing to the similarity of the names.
