Carl Linnaeus the Younger, Carolus Linnaeus the Younger or Carl von Linné d. y. (20 January 1741 – 1 November 1783) was a Swedish naturalist.

In 1763, aged just 22, he succeeded his father as the head of Practical Medicine at Uppsala.

His best-known work is the Supplementum Plantarum systematis vegetabilium of 1781, which contains botanical descriptions by the elder Linnaeus and his colleagues, edited and with additions by the son.He took a two-year trip to England, France, the Netherlands and Denmark between 1781 and 1783.
