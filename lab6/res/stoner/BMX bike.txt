BMX bike
A BMX bike is an off-road sport bicycle used for racing and stunt riding. BMX means bicycle motocross. Construction Though originally denoting a bicycle intended for BMX racing, the term "BMX bike" is now used to encompass race bikes, as well as those used for the dirt, vert, park, street, flatland and BMX freestyle disciplines of BMX. BMX frames are made of various types of steel, and (largely in the racing category) aluminum or carbon. Cheaper, low-end bikes are usually made of steel. High-range bikes are mostly chromoly or high tensile steel, although the latter is noticeably heavier with respect to strength. High-performance BMX bikes use lightweight 4130 chromoly, or generation 3 chromoly.The introduction and widespread popularity of the cassette hub and freecoaster has ushered in the use of smaller gearing on BMX bikes. Instead of the old 44/16 gearing found on almost all older BMX bikes and current BMX racing bikes, new freestyle bikes use gearing such as 36/13, 33/12, 30/11, 28/10, 25/9, 23/8,and even 22/8, all of which have similar gear ratios around 2.8:1. Advantages of smaller gearing hubs include lighter weight, and more clearance when grinding. Freecoaster hubs are popular among street and flatland riders. A freecoaster
