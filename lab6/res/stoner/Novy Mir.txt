Novy Mir
Novy Mir (Russian: Но́вый Ми́р, IPA: [ˈnovɨj ˈmʲir], New World) is a Russian-language monthly literary magazine. History Novy Mir has been published in Moscow since January 1925. It was supposed to be modelled on the popular pre-Soviet literary magazine Mir Bozhy ("God's World"), which was published from 1892 to 1906, and its follow-up, Sovremenny Mir ("Contemporary World"), which was published from 1906 to 1917. Novy Mir mainly published prose that approved of the general line of the Communist Party. In the early 1960s, Novy Mir changed its political stance, leaning to a dissident position. In November 1962 the magazine became famous for publishing Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's groundbreaking One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, a novella about a prisoner of the Gulag. In the same year its circulation was about 150,000 copies per a month. The magazine continued publishing controversial articles and stories about various aspects of Soviet and Russian history despite the fact that its editor-in-chief, Alexander Tvardovsky, facing significant political pressure, resigned in February 1970. With the appointment of Sergey Zalygin in 1986, at the beginning of perestroika, the magazine practised increasingly bold criticism of the Soviet Government, including figures such as Mikhail Gorbachev. It also published fiction
