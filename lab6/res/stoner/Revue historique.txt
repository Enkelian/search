The Revue historique is a French academic journal founded in 1876 by the Protestant Gabriel Monod and the Catholic Gustave Fagniez. The journal was founded as a reaction against the Revue des questions historiques created ten years earlier by Ultramontanists and Legitimists. The Revue historique has been published quarterly since 1937.The founders of the Revue historique stated that the journal was not intended to promote any particular religion, party, or doctrine. Most of its contributors came from Protestant or free thinker circles. Fagniez resigned in 1881 to protest the attacks of the Revue against the Catholic Church. Charles Bémont was an editor for the Revue from 1876 and served as a co-director until 1939. During the last quarter of the nineteenth century, the Revue's contributors included Charles Bayet, Arthur Giry, Camille Jullian, Gustave Bloch, Ernest Lavisse, Paul Guiraud and Ernest Havet. The Revue originated the historical method known as l'École méthodique, which is particularly associated with the names of Charles-Victor Langlois et Charles Seignobos.
