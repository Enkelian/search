École nationale supérieure de physique, électronique et matériaux
The École Nationale Supérieure de Physique, Électronique et Matériaux (commonly known as Phelma) is a Grande École located in Grenoble, France. Phelma is part of Grenoble Institute of Technology. The school specializes in physics, electronics and materials. The school is regularly ranked among the best in France in terms of Engineering, Research, and Innovation, according to French Magazines or International ones.Students are admitted to Phelma after two years of undergraduate studies: the Classe préparatoires aux Grandes Ecoles. Studies at Phelma are of three years' duration and lead to the French degree "Diplôme National d'Ingénieur" (equivalent to a master's degree in engineering). Based on Physics, Chemistry, Processes, Electronics, Nanotechnologies, Phelma's teaching curriculum is of a great scientific and technical diversity with teaching themes and professional opportunities such as: Micro and nanotechnologies (microelectronics, nanosciences, materials, health) Energy (nuclear energy & energy, alternative energies) Information technology (digital communication, image and signal processing, telecommunications, computers and networks, embedded software, Internet of Things) Innovative materials (applied to transport, energy, leisure, health, microelectronics, building) Biotechnology (medical imaging and therapy, implantable devices) Environment (alternative energies, eco-processes, energy management, natural signal analysis) History Phelma was born from the gathering of 3 engineering schools in 2008 : ENSEEG, ENSERG
