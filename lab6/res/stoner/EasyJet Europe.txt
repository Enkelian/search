EasyJet Europe
EasyJet Europe Airline GmbH, trading as easyJet, is an Austrian low-cost airline based in Vienna, Austria. It operates scheduled flights across Europe and is a subsidiary of EasyJet plc. History The airline was established on 18 July 2017 and started operations on 20 July 2017, with the first flight being an Airbus A320 (re-registered as OE-IVA, previously G-EZPA) flying from London Luton Airport to Vienna Airport. The airline was established following the UK referendum vote to leave the European Union and the airline's decision to obtain an Air Operator's Certificate (AOC) in another EU member state in order to continue operating flights across and within European countries after the UK leaves the EU.

EasyJet has announced that it is planning to re-register 110 aircraft to fly under the new AOC of EasyJet Europe by March 2019.EasyJet is thus a pan-European airline group with three airlines based in the UK, Austria and Switzerland (EasyJet UK, EasyJet Europe, and EasyJet Switzerland), all owned or part-owned by EasyJet plc, based
