Chained (Marvin Gaye song)
"Chained" is a 1968 single released by soul singer Marvin Gaye on the Tamla label. Written and produced by Frank Wilson, the song, much like his previous hit, "You", directed the singer towards a grittier and funkier musical element than his previous hits. His second non-duet solo hit after two years of, mostly, duet singles with the likes of Kim Weston and Tammi Terrell, the song talked about how he was just with his estranged lover and then the lover disappeared and the narrator hopes to bring her back home. The song was another top forty entry for Gaye peaking at number thirty-two on the chart while ascending to number eight R&B. The male background singing group, The Originals, would later collaborate with Gaye on their own singles such as "Baby I'm for Real" and "The Bells". The song was first recorded by actor Paul Petersen in 1967. Charts Credits Lead vocals by Marvin Gaye Background vocals by The Originals: Freddie Gorman, Walter Gaines, Hank Dixon, C.P.
