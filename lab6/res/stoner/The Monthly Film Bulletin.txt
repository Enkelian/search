The Monthly Film Bulletin
The Monthly Film Bulletin was a periodical of the British Film Institute published monthly from February 1934 to April 1991, when it merged with Sight & Sound. It reviewed all films on release in the United Kingdom, including those with a narrow arthouse release. History The Monthly Film Bulletin was edited in the mid-1950s by David Robinson, in the late 1950s and early 1960s by Peter John Dyer, and then by Tom Milne. By the end of the 1960s, when the character and tone of its reviews changed considerably with the arrival of a new generation of critics influenced by the student culture and intellectual tumult of the time (not least the overthrow of old ideas of "taste" and quality), David Wilson was the editor. It was then edited by Jan Dawson (1938 â€“ 1980), for two years from 1971, and from 1973 until its demise by the New Zealand-born critic Richard Combs. In 1991 The Monthly Film Bulletin was merged with Sight & Sound, which had until then been published quarterly - Sight & Sound then became a monthly publication and took up The Monthly Film Bulletin's remit to review all films released in the UK.
