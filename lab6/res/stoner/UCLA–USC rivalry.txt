UCLA–USC rivalry
The UCLA–USC rivalry is the American collegiate athletics rivalry between the UCLA Bruins sports teams of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and USC Trojans teams of the University of Southern California (USC). Both universities are located in Los Angeles and are members of the Pac-12 Conference. The rivalry between the two is among the more unusual in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I sports, because the campuses are only 12 miles (19 km) apart, and both are located within the same megacity. UCLA teams have won the second-most NCAA Division I-sanctioned team championships with 118 while USC has the third-most with 107. Only Stanford University, a fellow Pac-12 member also located in California, has more than either UCLA or USC, with 122. Background USC is recognized as consistently being one of the top football programs in the nation, while UCLA is recognized as consistently being one of the top basketball programs in the nation. However, a somewhat rare confluence of events occurred in 1954, which began with USC in their last of only two Final Four appearance in the 1954 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament and ended with UCLA winning their only non-NCAA Football National Championship.
