APLU Councils are composed of university administrators with similar job functions who come together to address critical issues and expand their knowledge base within their professional area of expertise. APLU Commissions cut across job function to enable individuals from multiple disciplines across universities to address critical issues and expand their knowledge base in areas of common interest. Membership criteria Membership in APLU is automatically granted to land-grant institutions per the Morrill Land-Grant Acts of 1862, 1890, and 1994.
