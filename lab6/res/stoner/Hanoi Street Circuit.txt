Hanoi Street Circuit
The Hanoi Street Circuit (Vietnamese: Đường đua phố Hà Nội) is a motor racing venue located in the Nam Từ Liêm district of Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam. It is a street circuit designed to host the Vietnamese Grand Prix, a round of the Formula One World Championship. The circuit is 5.607 km (3.484 mi) long and was designed by circuit architect Hermann Tilke. The Hanoi Street Circuit is expected to make its début on the Formula One calendar in 2020. The circuit, going anticlockwise, is located next to the Mỹ Đình National Stadium and consists of a temporary street section and a purpose-built layout that will be open to the public once completed. It also features one of the longest straights on the calendar at 1.5 km (0.9 mi) in length. The purpose-built section draws inspiration from several existing circuits including the Circuit de Monaco, Suzuka Circuit, Sepang International Circuit and the Nürburgring "GP-Strecke". This philosophy of adapting corners from other circuits had previously been used in designing the layout of the Circuit of the Americas. The original layout consisted of twenty-two corners, but this was revised in December 2019 to include an additional corner in the third sector.
