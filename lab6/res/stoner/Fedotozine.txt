Fedotozine
Fedotozine (INN; JO 1196 for the (-) tartrate salt) is an opioid drug of the arylacetamide series which acts as a peripherally specific selective κ1-opioid receptor agonist with preference for the κ1A subtype. It was under investigation for the treatment of gastrointestinal conditions like irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia and made it to phase III clinical trials, but ultimately development was discontinued and it was never marketed.
