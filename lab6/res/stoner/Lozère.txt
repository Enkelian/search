Lozère
Lozère (French pronunciation: ​[lɔzɛʁ]; Occitan: Losera [luˈzeɾɔ]) is a department in the region of Occitanie in Southern France, located near the Massif Central. It is named after Mont Lozère. With a 2016 population of 76,422, it is the least populous French department. History Lozère was created in 1790 during the French Revolution, when the whole of France was divided into departments, replacing the old provinces. Lozère was formed with part of the old province of Languedoc. Les Sources and Hautes-Cèvennes were two other names proposed for this department but they were not accepted.Pliny's Natural History praised the cheese of Lozère: The kinds of cheese that are most esteemed at Rome, where the various good things of all nations are to be judged of by comparison, are those that come from the provinces of Nemausus, and more especially the area there of Lesura and Gabalis (Lozère and Gévaudan); but its excellence is only very short-lived, and it must be eaten while it is fresh.During the period 1764-67, the Beast of Gévaudan, a creature believed to be a wolf, terrorized the general area in the Margeride Mountains of the former province of Gévaudan (nearly identical with the modern Lozère department).
