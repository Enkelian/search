Paw Tracks
Paw Tracks (formerly known as Soccer Stars until 2000, then Animal until 2003) was an independent record label based in Washington, D.C. At first only records by Animal Collective were released on the label, but since 2004 it has also released records by other artists; the first was The Doldrums by Ariel Pink in October 2004. Although originally exclusively run by the members of Animal Collective, Paw Tracks is now co-owned by members of Carpark Records. A number of the artists on Paw Tracks were chosen by Animal Collective to perform at the All Tomorrow's Parties Festival 2011. The label's website features artwork by Abby Portner (sister of Animal Collective's Avey Tare and member of the Paw Tracks group Drawlings (formerly First Nation/Rings)).
