Jund Hims
Jund Ḥimṣ (Arabic: جُـنْـد حِـمْـص‎, "military district of Homs," or Legion of Emesa) was one of the four military districts of the Caliphate province of Syria. Its capital was Homs, from which the district received its name. Its principal urban centres were Latakia, Tadmur, Jableh, Kafr Tab, Tarsus, Salamiyya, Bulunyas and the Fortress of Khawabi.After the Muslim conquest of Syria in the 7th century CE, the Rashidun caliph Umar divided the region of Syria into four districts, in which Jund Hims became the northernmost district. After the ascent of the Umayyad dynasty, its caliph Muawiya I separated the northern territories of Jund Hims, establishing Jund Qinnasrin out of them. The southern boundary line of Jund Hims laid immediately to the south of Qara, while its northern limit lay beyond the village of al-Karashiyya. Eastward were the towns of Tadmur and al-Qaryatayn.
