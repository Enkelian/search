2007–08 Scottish Cup
The 2007–08 Scottish Cup was the 123rd season of Scotland's most prestigious football knockout competition. The winners were Rangers, who defeated Queen of the South in the final. The 2007–08 tournament saw a change in structure for the tournament with the admission of 4 members of the Scottish Junior Football Association to the first round. Calendar First round Edinburgh University were given a random bye to the 2nd round. This was because only three Scottish Junior Football Association clubs entered, due to Linlithgow Rose winning both the East League and the Scottish Junior Cup and there being no mechanism allowing for runners-up to enter. Keith, Inverurie Loco Works, Annan Athletic and Threave Rovers all received automatic byes into the 2nd round, due to being respectively: Highland Football League winners and runners-up, East of Scotland Football League winners and South of Scotland Football League winners during 2006–07 season.
