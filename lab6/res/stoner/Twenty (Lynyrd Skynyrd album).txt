Twenty (Lynyrd Skynyrd album)
Twenty is the ninth studio album by Lynyrd Skynyrd released in 1997. The title of the album refers to the fact that it had been twenty years since the plane crash which killed original lead singer Ronnie Van Zant, guitarist Steve Gaines, and backup singer Cassie Gaines. For this album the band brought in two Southern rock veterans, Rickey Medlocke, who had been a drummer for the band briefly before forming Blackfoot, and Hughie Thomasson of the Outlaws. The track "Travelin' Man" is the first studio recording of the song from the original band's 1976 live album One More From The Road. Making use of modern technology, the band was able to use original singer Ronnie Van Zant's vocal tracks on parts of the song, in order to create a duet between Johnny and Ronnie. The Album Cover is a fictional drawing of Monument Valley on the Navajo reservation.
