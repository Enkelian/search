Alibi is a British pay television channel that was launched on 1 November 1997 as UK Arena, then being renamed to UK Drama in 2000, then to UKTV Drama in 2004, and finally rebranded to its current name on 7 October 2008. History The channel originally launched as part of the new four channel UKTV network on 1 November 1997. The channel, originally named UK Arena, focused on arts programming and was named after the BBC's flagship arts programme Arena (The BBC, through BBC Worldwide, owning half of UKTV and therefore half the channel). However, following disappointing original ratings, the channel's focus was broadened to include all drama series, and was renamed UK Drama as a result on 31 March 2000.

Following the successful relaunch and rebranding of the channel UKTV G2 as Dave on 15 October 2007, the remainder of the UKTV network underwent the same treatment since UKTV's announcement of 11 June 2008. UKTV Drama was rebranded as Alibi on 7 October 2008, and the channel's programming
