El Dorado Park, Long Beach, California
The El Dorado Park neighborhood of Long Beach, California, is on the east side of the city adjacent to the large El Dorado Regional Park. Lakewood is north of El Dorado Park, while Hawaiian Gardens is northeast, and Los Alamitos is east of El Dorado Park. The park is bounded on the east by the 605 Freeway, on the north by the Long Beach Town Center shopping mall, and on the south by Stearns Street. Because of the barrier of the freeway and park between the neighborhood and the rest of Long Beach, as well as the barrier created by near Norwalk Blvd and the Coyote creek and the neighboring cities, the El Dorado Park neighborhood feels quite separate. The regional park sits in a flood zone, and it protects residences from spillover from the neighboring San Gabriel River. Additional undeveloped land south of Willow street near the confluence of Coyote Creek and the San Gabriel River is held by Southern California Edison, and some designated to become part of the park's Nature Center. The park was developed in 1968 after the land was sold to the City of Long Beach by members of the Bixby family and was financed
