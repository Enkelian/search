The Art Newspaper
The Art Newspaper is a monthly print publication, with daily updates online, founded in 1990 and based in London and New York City. It is published by Umberto Allemandi & Co. Publishing Ltd and is based on an original concept by the Turin publisher, Umberto Allemandi, who founded the first monthly newspaper, Il Giornale dell'Arte, in 1983. The concept is to cover news of the visual arts as they are affected by international politics and economics, developments in law, tax, the art market, the environment and official cultural policy. The publication is fed by a network of sister editions, with around fifty correspondents in over thirty countries. In addition to London and New York City, the network has editorial offices in Turin, Paris, Moscow, Beijing and Tel-Aviv. The Art Newspaper produces daily papers during the major art fairs, such as Art Basel and Frieze, and weekly podcasts on topical subjects. It is a campaigning newspaper, which has reported regularly on the trade in illicitly excavated antiquities, on damage to the heritage in warfare, and the maladministration and corruption that prevents Venice being protected from sea level rise, excessive tourism and the cruise ships.
