The service discontinued on the 15th December 2016, the development effort and service was rolled into BBC Sounds. Development Radio Explorer was developed during the BBC Design + Engineering's 10% time initiative. It was prototyped using the BBC's Forge platform, in order to show content the service took full advantage of Nitro, an API which allowed BBC products to search for content.After internal usage Radio Explorer went on to become a BBC online service. Radio Explorer worked by searching through programmes titles, subtitles, short synopsis, long synopsis and descriptions. Results were then filtered by those being available to play, including clips. Initially only speech networks were included, but later the service included all BBC networks.The service was later discussed on BBC Radio 5 live's The Radio Review of 2014 where "Christmas Puddings" was searched for during the show, it
