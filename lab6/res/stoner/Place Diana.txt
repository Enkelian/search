Place Diana
The Place Diana is situated in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, near the Seine river. History The place is named in memory of Diana, Princess of Wales, by vote of the Council of Paris in 2018. Features On this space rises the Flame of Liberty, a replica of the Statue of Liberty torch in New York City. The statue was erected in 1989 to celebrate the Franco-American friendship. Somewhat forgotten, the Flame benefited from a renewed interest when Diana, Princess of Wales died on August 31, 1997 during a road accident in the tunnel of pont de Alma, located below the monument. The public then diverted the Flame from its original function, spontaneously transforming it into an altar to Diana's memory.
