They married in West Sussex on 4 August 1990 and announced they had separated in September 2003, blaming the strain of coping with the murder of their daughter Sarah three years earlier. They had four surviving children; two sons and two daughters, the youngest daughter born in late 2003 just after their separation.On 27 October 2014, Michael Payne was found dead at the age of 46 at his home in Maidstone, Kent. He and his wife had been separated for 11 years, despite media reports in the early stages of their separation that they had been hoping to get back together at some stage. The death of Michael Payne was not treated as suspicious, and was believed to have been caused by an alcoholism related illness.
