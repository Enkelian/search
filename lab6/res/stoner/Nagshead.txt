Nagshead
Nagshead is a woodland reserve, located on the western edge of Parkend, in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, and is home to RSPB Nagshead. The site is listed in the 'Forest of Dean Local Plan Review'.More than half of the reserve consists of 19th-century oak woodland, which is now managed solely for its conservation and landscape value. In 1942, nest boxes were erected, in the hope that pied flycatchers would control oak leafroller moth larva, which were defoliating trees. These boxes have been continually monitored since 1948, making it the UK's longest-running bird breeding programme. Nagshead includes a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Facilities The reserve is open all year. Entrance and car parking are free. Facilities include; Visitor centre and toilets (open at weekends during the summer). Large car park. Two viewing hides. Two way-marked walks (1 mile and 2.25 miles). Picnic area. Information boards. Birds Wrens, buzzards, redstarts, pied flycatchers, and crossbills are frequently seen in the reserve, but visitors may also spot great spotted woodpeckers, nuthatches, redwings, woodcocks and wood warblers. Other wildlife More than 30 different butterflies and 20 dragonflies and damselflies have been seen at Nagshead. 8 of Britain's 12 reptiles and amphibians
