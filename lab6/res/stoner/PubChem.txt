PubChem
PubChem is a database of chemical molecules and their activities against biological assays. The system is maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), a component of the National Library of Medicine, which is part of the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH). PubChem can be accessed for free through a web user interface. Millions of compound structures and descriptive datasets can be freely downloaded via FTP. PubChem contains substance descriptions and small molecules with fewer than 1000 atoms and 1000 bonds. More than 80 database vendors contribute to the growing PubChem database. Databases PubChem consists of three dynamically growing primary databases. As of 1 November 2017: Compounds, 93.9 million entries (up from 54 million entries in Sept 2014), contains pure and characterized chemical compounds. Substances, 236 million entries (up from 163 million entries in Sept 2014), contains also mixtures, extracts, complexes and uncharacterized substances. BioAssay, bioactivity results from 1.25 million (up from 6000 in Sept 2014) high-throughput screening programs with several million values. Searching Searching the databases is possible for a broad range of properties including chemical structure, name fragments, chemical formula, molecular weight, XLogP, and hydrogen bond donor and acceptor count.
