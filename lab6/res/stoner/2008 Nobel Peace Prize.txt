2008 Nobel Peace Prize
The 2008 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to President of Finland (1994â€“2000) Martti Ahtisaari "for his important efforts, on several continents and over more than three decades, to resolve international conflicts". Announcement The 2008 Nobel Peace Prize laureate was announced on the press conference in Oslo, Norway on October 10, 2008. Reaction The committee's decision was heavily criticized in Serbia, because of Ahtisaari's role in the Kosovo status process (the Government of Serbia rejects Ahtisaari's plan because it would allegedly guarantee the de facto independence of Kosovo). On the other hand, committee's decision was praised by Albanians living in Norway who saluted him in on 10 December in Oslo, by waving the flags of Albania and Kosovo. == References ==
