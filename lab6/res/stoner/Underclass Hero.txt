Underclass Hero
Underclass Hero is the fourth studio album by Canadian rock band Sum 41. It is the first of two albums by the band recorded without guitarist Dave Baksh since he left a year early to focus on Brown Brigade. The album was recorded as a three-piece. The album was first released July 18, 2007 in Japan. It was released under the Island Records label and distributed worldwide by Universal Records, by Aquarius Records. There are no photos of the band inside the liner notes, though the front cover features a monochrome image of vocalist Deryck Whibley spitting in a hallway. The album features more alternative rock songs than their previous albums. The album's lyrics have been described as more mature and personal than in some of the band's previous records. It was written as a concept album focusing on lead vocalist Deryck Whibley's outlook on life, covering subjects such as politics, atheism and family life. The album has more of a pop punk sound in comparison to the alternative metal style of their previous album, Chuck. The album was a commercial success, peaking at number 1 on the Canadian Albums Chart and at number 7 on the U.S. Billboard 200.
