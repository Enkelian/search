Merlin (TV series)
Merlin, also known as The Adventures of Merlin, is a British fantasy-adventure drama television programme starring Bradley James as Prince Arthur and Colin Morgan as Merlin. It was broadcast on BBC One from 20 September 2008 to 24 December 2012 for a total of 65 episodes. The show is loosely based on the Arthurian legends of the young wizard Merlin and his extremely close relationship with King Arthur, but it differs from traditional versions. Merlin is a reimagining of the legend; in it, the future King Arthur and Merlin are young contemporaries, as differentiated from the traditional stories in which Merlin is an older adviser to the young prince/king. In this telling, Arthur's father Uther Pendragon has banned magic in Camelot. Its use is punishable by death, forcing Merlin to keep his magical powers secret from everyone in Camelot other than his mentor Gaius. Arthur grows from a young, self-absorbed boy to the mighty king in the legends, while Merlin develops into his colossal role as a magician helping to found the powerful Camelot. The show was picked up by the BBC in 2006. The series premiered in 2008 to mixed reviews but good ratings which improved as the series
