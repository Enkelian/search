RNIB Connect Radio
RNIB Connect Radio (previously Insight Radio) is a British radio station that is part of Royal National Institute of Blind People and was Europe's first radio station for blind and partially sighted listeners. It broadcasts 24 hours a day, 7 days a week online, on 101 FM in the Glasgow area, and on Freeview channel 730. Live shows make up around half of the station's output, with the overnight schedule being used as a showcase for the best music, features, interviews and articles from the past few days. Most of the presenters are blind or visually impaired. From 2007 until early 2016 it was known as Insight Radio. Although the station's main studios are based in Scotland, the station is for everyone in the UK and beyond, with many listeners in the United States and Canada. Other studios are in Edinburgh, Cardiff and London and more locations across the UK are planned for the very near future.
