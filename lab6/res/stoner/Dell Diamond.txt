Dell Diamond
Dell Diamond is the home stadium of the Round Rock Express, the Triple-A Minor League Baseball affiliate of the Houston Astros major league baseball team. On April 16, 2000, the then-Double-A affiliate Express played their first home game at the stadium.Dell Diamond is built on 85 acres (344,000 mÂ²) of former farmland on the east side of Round Rock, Texas, a rapidly growing suburban city northeast of Austin. Nolan Ryan and his son Reid Ryan, part owners of the Express, originally wanted a stadium inside the city of Austin, but found a more attractive site in the City of Round Rock, with support from the city leadership. The city of Round Rock contributed $7.35 million to the $25 million cost of the facility. The city owns the ballpark and gave the Express a 38-year lease. Local-based computer technology company Dell contracted for naming rights in a deal that will cost the company $2.5 million over 15 years. Events The stadium has also hosted several college games, including some early-season University of Texas contests in 2007 while the Longhorns' home field, UFCU Disch-Falk Field, had been undergoing a major renovation project. A showcase neutral-site game was played on February 21, 2012,
