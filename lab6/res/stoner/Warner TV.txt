Warner TV
Warner TV is a Latin American, French and Southeast Asian pay television channel owned by Warner Bros. through its International Television unit that focuses on airing American series and films. Most programming air in their original English audio, with subtitles in Spanish (for Latin American countries except Brazil), Portuguese (for Brazil), Chinese (for Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore), Malaysian (for Malaysia) and Indonesian (for Indonesia), however, there are also some dubbed programming. On November 1, 2015, the Latin American channel switched to dub programming instead of just subtitling them. This caused an uproar to most of its audience. Warner TV's headquarters are located in Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Singapore, and Malaysia; the broadcasting, however, is based in Miami for Latin American viewers and Singapore for Asian viewers. On November 9, 2017, Turner Broadcasting System Europe and Canal+ Group both launched Warner TV in France.All television series airing on the channel are sourced from the library of Warner Bros., which licensed its name to the channel until 2019. In March 2015, the Filipino feed separated from the Southeast Asian Warner TV channel as it now has a different programming schedule, including selected programming from truTV.
