Transatlantic (band)
Transatlantic is a multinational progressive rock supergroup consisting of Neal Morse (ex-Spock's Beard), Roine Stolt (Kaipa, The Flower Kings), Pete Trewavas (Marillion, Edison's Children) and Mike Portnoy (ex-Dream Theater). They formed in 1999 as a side project to their full-time bands, but disbanded in 2002. They then reunited in 2009. Typical of the genre, the band's songs are often very long and regularly exceed 15-20 minutes in length. Despite not being an official member and not appearing on the studio albums, Daniel Gildenl√∂w (Pain of Salvation) has traditionally joined the band during live shows. However, due to illness, Ted Leonard (Spock's Beard, Enchant, Thought Chamber) stood in for him during the 2014 tour.
