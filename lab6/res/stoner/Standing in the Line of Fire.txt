Standing in the Line of Fire
Standing in the Line of Fire is an album released by Gary U.S. Bonds in 1984, under the band title of Gary U.S. Bonds and the American Men. The album was a followup to his two Springsteen/Van Zandt-produced albums Dedication and On the Line, though the only carry-over from the previous two albums was Steven Van Zandt, who wrote, sang backing vocals for, and played lead guitar on the title track. The album also features a cover of Ritchie Valens' "Come On Let's Go". The title track was released as a single paired with "Wild Nights", but received little attention. The album remains unissued on CD.
