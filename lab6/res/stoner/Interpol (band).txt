Interpol (band)
Interpol is an American rock band formed in New York City in 1997. Their original line-up consisted of Paul Banks (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Daniel Kessler (lead guitar, backing vocals), Carlos Dengler (bass guitar, keyboards), and Greg Drudy (drums). Drudy left the band in 2000 and was replaced by Sam Fogarino. Dengler left to pursue other projects in 2010, with Banks taking on the additional role of bassist instead of hiring a new one. Having first performed at Luna Lounge alongside peers such as the Strokes, Longwave, the National, and Stellastarr, Interpol is one of the bands associated with the New York indie music scene and one of several groups that emerged from the post-punk revival of the 2000s. The band's sound is generally a mix of staccato bass and rhythmic, harmonized guitar with a snare-heavy mix, drawing comparisons to post-punk bands such as Joy Division, Television, and the Chameleons. The band has no primary lyricist, with each member contributing to songwriting.Interpol's debut album Turn On the Bright Lights (2002) was critically acclaimed, making it to No. 10 on NME's list of the top albums of the year and No. 1 on Pitchfork Media's list of the top 50 albums
