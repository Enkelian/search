A Place in the Sun (Tim McGraw album)
A Place in the Sun is the fifth studio album by American country music artist Tim McGraw. It was released on May 4, 1999. "Please Remember Me" was nominated for Best Male Country Vocal Performance at the 2000 Grammy Awards. "My Best Friend" was nominated in the same category the following year. The CD was originally available with a limited edition booklet that had two transparent sleeves inside. Subsequent releases have all the same information, though without the transparent pages. This album produced the singles "Please Remember Me", "Something Like That", "My Best Friend", "My Next Thirty Years" and "Some Things Never Change"; "Please Remember Me" was originally recorded by Rodney Crowell on his 1995 album Jewel of the South, and was a #69 country hit for him that year. Except for the #7-peaking "Some Things Never Change", all the singles on this album reached number one on the Hot Country Songs charts; "Seventeen" and "Señorita Margarita" also reached the lower regions of that chart from unsolicited airplay.
