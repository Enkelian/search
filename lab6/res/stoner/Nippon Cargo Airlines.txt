History Nippon Cargo Airlines was established on September 21, 1978 (its head office was initially a single room inside All Nippon Airways' space at the Kasumigaseki Building) and started operations in 1985. It was Japan's first all-cargo airline. Over time, their network has grown to include many cities on three continents. Initially, NCA was a joint venture of shipping companies headed by Nippon Yusen and All Nippon Airways (ANA). In August 2005, ANA sold its stake to Nippon Yusen. The airline is owned by Nippon Yusen (100%). In December 2010, NCA was selected to provide ground support services for the Japanese Air Force One aircraft, replacing Japan Airlines which was then in the process of retiring its 747 fleet.
