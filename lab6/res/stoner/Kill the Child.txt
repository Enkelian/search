Kill the Child
Kill the Child is the sixth live album by the New York City No Wave band Swans, released in 1996. It was recorded from shows in 1985, 1986 and 1987 in Germany, Yugoslavia, the UK, and (unlisted) the United States. Mastered as a single track in an attempt to recreate the concert experience, Kill the Child is considered by many fans and critics to be one of Swans' most brutal live albums. The recording focuses primarily on Gira-sung material from Children of God, in particular the musically heavier material, with the exception of the Jarboe-sung "Blood and Honey" and two selections from Holy Money.
