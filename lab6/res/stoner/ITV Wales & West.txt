ITV Wales & West
ITV Wales and West, previously known as Harlech Television (HTV), refers to the Independent Television franchise area until 31 December 2013, licensed to a broadcaster by the regulator Ofcom.There is no channel, past or present, named "ITV Wales and West". The licence relates to a 'dual region', meaning that the franchise area was divided into two regions, each of which had to be served by distinct and separate ITV programme services, as more fully defined within the licence. Today, those services are known as ITV Cymru Wales and ITV West Country (since ITV West and ITV Westcountry merged into a single region). They are provided by ITV plc which owns and operates the two services through its subsidiary ITV Broadcasting Ltd. From January 2014, the dual-region licence was split in two, with ITV Cymru Wales for Wales and ITV West Country covering the West of England. Both licences remain held by ITV Broadcasting Ltd and the legal names of the former HTV companies have not yet been changed again.The National Library of Wales archives now store 200,000 ITV (HTV) film and video items dating from 1958. History Harlech Television was awarded its contract by the Independent Television Authority in July
