All-terrain vehicle
An all-terrain vehicle (ATV), also known as a quad (bike), three-wheeler, four-track, four-wheeler, or quadricycle, as defined by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) is a vehicle that travels on low-pressure tires, with a seat that is straddled by the operator, along with handlebars for steering control. As the name implies, it is designed to handle a wider variety of terrain than most other vehicles. Although it is a street-legal vehicle in some countries, it is not street-legal within most states, territories, and provinces of Australia, the United States, or Canada. By the current ANSI definition, ATVs are intended for use by a single operator, although some companies have developed ATVs intended for use by the operator and one passenger. In some countries, the passenger is not required to wear a helmet. These ATVs are referred to as tandem ATVs.The rider sits on and operates these vehicles like a motorcycle, but the extra wheels give more stability at slower speeds. Also dirt bikes are considered to be ATVs as that they were designed for off-road use only. Although most are equipped with three or four wheels, six-wheel models exist for specialized applications.
