Sound Barrier
Sound Barrier is an American pioneering all-black heavy metal quartet from Los Angeles, California, United States, whose members have also recorded and toured with acts such as Masi, Total Eclipse, Mother's Finest and Fishbone. Biography Formed in 1980 after vocalist Bernie K. and guitarist Spacey T. met while playing in a R&B funk band, Sound Barrier was most notable for the fact that, as a heavy metal band specializing in what was widely perceived to be a "white-dominated" genre, all four original members were African American, which gained them significant publicity but did not result in commercial success. They were signed by MCA Records but quickly dropped again when their debut album, Total Control (1982), sold just 12,000 copies.The band issued a self-released EP, Born to Rock (1984), engineered and produced by Karat Faye, which contained a cover of the Steppenwolf classic "Born to Be Wild". Bassist Stanley E. left the fold in 1986 and was replaced by Romanian-born Emil Lech who had previously played in Terriff with future Ozzy Osbourne guitarist Joe Holmes. The band was signed to Metal Blade for their Speed of Light LP (1986), this time covering Thin Lizzy's "Hollywood (Down on Your Luck)", but split
