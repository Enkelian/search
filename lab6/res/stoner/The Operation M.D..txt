The band's debut album, We Have an Emergency, was released in February 2007 by Aquarius Records. Their second album Birds + Bee Stings was self-released by the band's own label "Mouth To Mouth Music" in June 2010.

The band's debut album We Have an Emergency was recorded during the summer of 2006, when Sum 41 was on hiatus, and was released on February 20, 2007 in Canada with two music videos made for the songs "Sayanora" and "Someone Like You", with both videos being directed by Sum 41 drummer Steve Jocz (Dr. Dinero).
