Cartoon Network Studios
Cartoon Network Studios is an American animation studio owned by Warner Bros. Entertainment. Located in Burbank, California, the studio primarily produces and develops animated programs and shorts for Cartoon Network. In the 2010s, their programs began to expand into their sister companies Adult Swim and HBO Max. The company has only produced one theatrically released film, The Powerpuff Girls Movie, which was distributed by its parent company, Warner Bros. Pictures. The actual animation service for their productions is done overseas, mostly in South Korea at Digital eMation, Saerom Animation, Rough Draft Korea, and Sunmin Image Pictures, with pre-production and post-production being United States-based. History Cartoon Network Studios originated as a division of Hanna-Barbera Cartoons, Inc. that focused on producing original programming for Cartoon Network, including What a Cartoon!, Dexter's Laboratory, Johnny Bravo, and The Powerpuff Girls. Following the 1996 merger of Hanna-Barbera's parent, Turner Broadcasting System with Time Warner, and after being located on Cahuenga Boulevard in Los Angeles since 1963, the Hanna-Barbera studio, its archives, and its extensive animation art collection, were relocated in 1998 to Sherman Oaks Galleria in Sherman Oaks, California, where Warner Bros. Animation was located. This relocation was executed by its chief executive, Jean MacCurdy.
