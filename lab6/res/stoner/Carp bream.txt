It is now considered to be the only species in the genus Abramis. Range and habitat The common bream's home range is Europe north of the Alps and Pyrenees, as well as the Balkans. It is found as far as east as the Caspian Sea, the Black Sea and the Aral Sea. The common bream lives in ponds, lakes and canals, and in slow-flowing rivers. Description The bream is usually 30 to 55 cm (12 to 22 in) long, though some specimens of 75 cm (30 in) have been recorded; it usually weighs 2 to 4 kg (4.4 to 8.8 lb). The maximum length is 90 cm (35.5 in) with a maximum recorded weight of about 9.1 kg (20 lb). It has a laterally flattened and high-backed body and a slightly undershot mouth.
