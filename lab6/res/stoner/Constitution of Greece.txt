Constitution of Greece
The Constitution of Greece (Greek: Σύνταγμα της Ελλάδας, Syntagma tis Elladas), was created by the Fifth Revisionary Parliament of the Hellenes in 1974, after the fall of the Greek military junta and the start of the Third Hellenic Republic. It came into force in 1975 and has been amended in 1986, 2001, 2008 and 2019. The constitutional history of Greece goes back to the Greek War of Independence (1821–1832), during which the first three Greek constitutions were adopted by the revolutionary national assemblies. Syntagma Square (Plateia Syntagmatos) in Athens is named after the first constitution adopted in the modern Greek State. Context The Constitution consists of 120 articles, in four parts: The first part (articles 1-3), Basic provisions, establishes Greece as a presidential parliamentary democracy (or republic – the Greek δημοκρατία can be translated both ways), and confirms the prevalence of the Orthodox Church in Greece. The second part (articles 4-25) concerns individual and social rights, whose protection has been reinforced after the Revision of 2001. The new provisions regulate subjects such as the protection of personal data and the competence of certain independent authorities. The third part (articles 26-105) describes the organization and function of the State. Article 28
