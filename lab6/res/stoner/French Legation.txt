French Legation
The French Legation is a historic legation building in eastern Austin, Texas, built in 1841 to represent the French government in the new Republic of Texas. It is among the oldest extant frame structures in Austin. The building and its surroundings were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1969. The French Legation is also a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark, a City of Austin Historic Landmark, and a Texas State Antiquities Landmark. Beginning in the 1940s, the historic site and its buildings were managed and operated by the Daughters of the Republic of Texas as custodians for the State of Texas which holds title to the property. Operation was transferred to the Texas Historical Commission in 2017. History After Texas declared independence from Mexico in 1836, France was one of two countries (the other being the United States) to officially recognize Texas as an independent state. The Treaty of Amity, Navigation, and Commerce between the two countries formalized this recognition in September 25, 1839. France assigned Monsieur Jean Pierre Isidore Alphonse Dubois, a secretary to the French Legation in Washington, to be the new charg√© d'affaires to the Republic of Texas, representing the King of France, Louis Philippe.
