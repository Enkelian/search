Nat Geo Wild (Canada)
Nat Geo Wild is a Canadian English-language Category B specialty channel owned by Corus Entertainment and National Geographic Channel. The channel airs programming devoted to wildlife, nature, and animals. History In April 2010, Shaw Media (the majority owner and operator of the Canadian version]] of National Geographic Channel) had requested the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to add the American version of Nat Geo Wild to the list of available foreign channels permitted to broadcast in Canada. Both High Fidelity HDTV (the owner of Oasis HD) and CTV Speciality Television Inc. (the major owner of the Canadian version of Animal Planet) sent letters to CRTC to oppose the request because they considered Nat Geo Wild to be competitive with Oasis HD and Animal Planet. The CRTC denied the application on February 15, 2011.In October 2011, NGC Channel Inc. (a company owned by Shaw and National Geographic Channel in the U.S.) put forth its own application to the CRTC in order to launch a Canadian version of Nat Geo Wild. The licence was approved by the CRTC on April 13, 2012. Neither High Fidelity HDTV nor Bell Media voiced a concern about Nat Geo Wild competing with their services. In
