Rob Roth
Rob Roth is a multiplatform artist and director based in New York City. He works in a variety of media including theater, video, sculpture and performance. Roth received his BFA from Pratt Institute and has exhibited different work at a variety of venues including the New Museum, Performance Space 122, HERE Arts Center, Museum of Arts and Design and Deitch Projects as well as the Whitney Museum of American Art. Roth's work had its early fertilization in the 1990s New York City nightlife arena, most notably at the legendary underground nightclub, Jackie 60 and MOTHER. His poetic visual language springs from his initial training as a painter and results in lyrical and mysterious works within a deconstructed narrative. His explorations of cinematic language and form within live performance and installation, result in creations of haunting imagery influenced by renaissance painting, classic Hollywood films, and the mystical subconscious. In 2018 Rob premiered the highly praised haunting theater piece, SOUNDSTAGE, featuring actor Rebecca Hall. Roth also directed the music video Doom or Destiny by Blondie featuring Joan Jett which appeared on several “Best of 2017” lists as well as performing in Atlas Obscura’s site specific Into the Veil event at Green-Wood Cemetery.
