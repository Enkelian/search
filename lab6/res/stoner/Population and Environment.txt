Population and Environment
Population and Environment is a peer-reviewed academic journal covering research on the bi-directional links between population, natural resources, and the natural environment. The editor-in-chief is Dr Elizabeth Fussell, associate professor of population studies and environment and society at Brown University. Former editors-in-chief of the journal include prominent racialists such as Virginia Abernethy and Kevin B. MacDonald; racialists appear to have since lost control of the journal since MacDonald's term as editor ended in 2004. References External links Official website
