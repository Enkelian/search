Night Flight (Justin Hayward album)
Night Flight is a studio album by Moody Blues frontman Justin Hayward, released on Decca Records in 1980. It was reissued on CD in September 1989. The album came about as a result of Hayward's involvement in Jeff Wayne's musical adaptation of War of the Worlds. Wayne produced and arranged the album, which proved to be one of the lengthiest recording experiences of Hayward's career. The music was mostly pop and dance oriented, and most of the tracks were romantic love songs. It was not a favourite with Moody Blues fans, and was not a commercial success. The title track was the last to be recorded for the album. In April 2004, the album was remastered and released on CD with two extra tracks.
