Tell Me More
Tell Me More is a National Public Radio interview show that was hosted by journalist Michel Martin. Tell Me More was first introduced online in December 2006 through an "open piloting" program called "Rough Cuts." Martin and the show's producers provided a regular podcast and blog on NPR's website, testing show ideas, offering sample segments, and soliciting user feedback. It began broadcasting on April 30, 2007. NPR announced on May 20, 2014 that it would be canceling Tell Me More on August 1, 2014 and laying off 28 people as part of a larger effort to eliminate NPR's budget deficit. Host Michel Martin will stay with the network as will a small subset of her current team. She will report for NPR newsmagazines such as Morning Edition and All Things Considered on race and diversity issues as well as faith, family, and identity issues. Upon announcement of the show's cancellation, Martin acknowledged having "scar tissue" as a result of the failure of NPR leadership to institutionalize support for the program and expressed her intention to hold the network to its mission and its promises, "We've done a lot to show what's possible here and I want to keep that going.
