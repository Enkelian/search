1978 Commonwealth Games
The 1978 Commonwealth Games were held in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada from 3 to 12 August 1978, two years after the 1976 Summer Olympics were held in Montreal, Quebec. They were boycotted by Nigeria, in protest of New Zealand's sporting contacts with apartheid-era South Africa, as well as by Uganda, in protest of alleged Canadian hostility towards the government of Idi Amin. The Bid Election was held at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich. This was the first Commonwealth Games where a computerised system was used to handle ticket sales. These were the first Commonwealth Games to be named Commonwealth Games, having dropped British.
