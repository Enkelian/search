Point of Entry
Point of Entry is the seventh studio album by English heavy metal band Judas Priest, released on 26 February 1981 by Columbia Records. Following the commercial success of their previous album British Steel (1980), the band pursued a more radio-friendly direction on Point of Entry. Following the conclusion of the British Steel World Tour, the band began work on their next project. By this time, they had sufficient funds to fly all their equipment to the state-of-the-art Ibiza Studios in Spain. This gave Point of Entry a louder, stronger, more "live" sound than previous Judas Priest albums. Promotion Three singles were released from the album: "Heading Out to the Highway", "Don't Go" and "Hot Rockin'", all of which had accompanying music videos. The song "Heading Out to the Highway" has been a staple in live shows since its release, "Desert Plains" was regularly played throughout the 1980s and "Hot Rockin'" is still performed. On the 2005 "Re-united" tour they also played "Solar Angels" on rare occasions, while on the World Wide Blitz Tour of 1981 (supporting Point of Entry), it had been the opening song of every show. On parts of that tour, "Troubleshooter" was also performed. Cover "Europe, Mexico
