Warp Riders Tour
The Warp Riders Tour is a 2010â€“2011 worldwide concert tour by American heavy metal band The Sword. Beginning on October 1, 2010 in the United States, the tour is in promotion of the band's upcoming 2010 third album Warp Riders, released on August 24, 2010. Following the United States leg of the tour, the band joined Soundwave, a travelling music festival, in Australia in 2011. They will then perform an additional 12 shows in Europe. Prior to the tour, the band supported Metallica on their continuing World Magnetic Tour in September, and during the tour they also performed at the Austin City Limits Festival, between October 8 and October 10. Between November and December 2010 a 26-date European leg was due to take place, but was cancelled early in October due to "circumstances beyond [the band's] control", later revealed to be the departure of drummer Trivett Wingo from the band. Drummer Kevin Fender joined The Sword as a touring member of the band in November, and is performing with the band on a rescheduled America leg throughout November and December, and on the Australian Soundwave festival leg in 2011.
