Derby Arena

Construction Construction was expected to be completed in November 2014 with the opening of the venue originally scheduled for January 2015. In May 2012 its development seemed uncertain due to a change of local government. It was constructed by contractors Bowmer and Kirkland and was scheduled for completion in 2014. The Arena was finally opened three months late in March 2015 by Sarah Storey and Margaret Beckett. It is Britain's fifth 250-metre indoor track, which is raised to allow easy access to the 12 badminton court size infield area. There are also a caf√©, fitness gym, group exercise studios and a spinning studio. Also proposed was an outdoor 1.7-kilometre (1.1 mi) closed road circuit race track and a mountain bike skills area which would have been built on The Sanctuary bird and wildlife reserve. A coalition of 16 local wildlife conservation groups expressed concern at the proposal, but it was approved in February 2014. An injunction brought against Derby City Council by Derbyshire Wildlife Trust led to a Judicial Review being granted
