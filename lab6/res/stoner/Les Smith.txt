Keith Leslie Smith is a former British keyboardist, once in the bands Anathema (1996, 2001–2011) and Cradle of Filth (1998–2000). Biography He was born in 1967 in the United Kingdom, Dewsbury, England. He did session work on keyboards for the British band Anathema on their album Eternity, released in 1996. During his time in Cradle of Filth, his stage persona consisted of wearing a custom Vicar Priest top, black leather trousers and goth make-up. He played keyboards in two of Cradle's releases: Cruelty and the Beast and From the Cradle to Enslave. Les was a session musician of the band Tourettes. Post-Cradle of Filth, he accused vocalist Dani Filth of considering it his own solo project ("Dani and the Filths" he jokes). However, they are on good terms these days.
