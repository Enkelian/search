Maxillary bone
The maxilla (plural: maxillae ) in vertebrates is the upper fixed (not fixed in Neopterygii) bone of the jaw formed from the fusion of two maxillary bones. The upper jaw includes the hard palate in the front of the mouth. The two maxillary bones are fused at the intermaxillary suture, forming the anterior nasal spine. This is similar to the mandible (lower jaw), which is also a fusion of two mandibular bones at the mandibular symphysis. The mandible is the movable part of the jaw. Structure In humans, the maxilla consists of: The body of the maxilla Four processes The zygomatic process The frontal process of maxilla The alveolar process The palatine process Three surfaces - anterior, posterior, medial The Infraorbital foramen The maxillary sinus The incisive foramen Articulations Each maxilla articulates with nine bones: two of the cranium: the frontal and ethmoid seven of the face: the nasal, zygomatic, lacrimal, inferior nasal concha, palatine, vomer, and the adjacent fused maxilla.Sometimes it articulates with the orbital surface, and sometimes with the lateral pterygoid plate of the sphenoid. Development The maxilla is ossified in membrane. Mall and Fawcett maintain that it is ossified from two centers only, one for the maxilla
