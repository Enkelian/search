A tramroad opened in 1812 to link mines in the Forest with Redbrook and Monmouth entered Coleford north of Broadwell. A mine, known in 1735 as Gentlemen Colliers, included a working pit at Littledean Lane End near Broadwell in 1835. Broadwell was also one of the scattered farmsteads on the east side of Coleford. Broadwell Farm, on the Forest boundary at the place once known as King's Broadwell, was recorded in 1789. There were three beerhouses at Broadwell in 1841. The British Land Society laid out new roads north of Broadwell Farm in 1859 and several houses had been built on them by the late 1870s. In 1886 a fife and drum band was based at Broadwell.
