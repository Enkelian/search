RTÉ2
RTÉ2 is an Irish free-to-air television channel operated by public service broadcaster RTÉ. It was launched in 1978 becoming the Republic of Ireland's second television channel. History In the 1970s the Irish government considered three options for the introduction of a second television service: the re-transmission of BBC1 Northern Ireland; authorisation of an independent commercial service; or charging RTÉ with the establishment of a second national channel. It was the last of these that was finally chosen.The channel, the Republic's second, began transmissions at 20:00 on 2 November 1978 with an opening broadcast of a gala ceremony from Cork Opera House. Owing to a technical fault, audio from BBC2 was played during the countdown instead of the proper soundtrack, and when the channel commenced programmes, there was no audio for the initial 15 seconds or so. At first the new channel broadcast in the evenings only. The first broadcast on RTÉ 2 was on 6 June 1978, it was largely aimed at those in "single channel land". Programmes included The Streets of San Francisco and Duchess of Duke Street.The opening night's line up was as follows: 20:00 – RTÉ 2 presenters Bernadette Ni Ghallchoir, Roisin Harkin and Raymond Maxwell introduce
