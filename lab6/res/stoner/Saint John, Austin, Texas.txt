History The neighborhood is named for the St. John's Industrial Institute and Home for Negro Orphans, which was built in 1906 and burned down in the 1940s. The institute and orphanage was operated by the St. John Regular Missionary Baptist District Association, which was formed by a group of African-American ministers in Wheatville. The association also hosted an annual encampment on the site of the institute. The land was eventually sold and developed into the Highland Mall. As part of the redevelopment of Highland Mall into a mixed-use Austin Community College campus, part of the land was redeveloped into an urban park called "St. John's Encampment Commons". == References ==
