Great Northwest Athletic Conference
The Great Northwest Athletic Conference (GNAC) is a collegiate athletic conference which has historically operated in the northwestern United States, but also currently includes four schools in areas not usually considered part of that region—two in Alaska (neither of which is located in Southeast Alaska, an area often considered part of the Northwest), one in eastern Montana (almost never considered part of the region), and one in the Canadian province of British Columbia (an area included with the Northwest U.S. in the larger Pacific Northwest region). It participates in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)'s Division II level, and is the only NCAA conference in any division with a Canadian university as a member. The conference was formed in 2001 when its original ten members split from the Pacific West Conference.
