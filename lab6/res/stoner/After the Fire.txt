After the Fire

Early career Keyboard player Peter Banks originally formed the band in 1972 in London, England. After the Fire then went through several personnel changes before settling on Banks, guitarist and vocalist Andy Piercy, bassist Nick Battle, and drummer Ivor Twydell. This line-up enjoyed local success in London, and released an album, Signs of Change, in 1978, on their own label. Having become a highly priced collectors' item, it was reissued on CD in 2004 with several bonus tracks. At this time, the band's sound was similar to that of bands like Genesis and Yes.. The band were explicit about their Christian faith - 'Signs of Change' is based on 'Pilgrim's Progress'. Success beckons After Battle left, Piercy switched to bass, and John Russell joined on guitar. The group signed to CBS, and released their second album, Laser Love, in 1979, which marked the band's move towards new wave, with shorter, more catchy pop rock
