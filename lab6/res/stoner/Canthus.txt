Canthus
Canthus (pl. canthi, palpebral commissures) is either corner of the eye where the upper and lower eyelids meet. More specifically, the inner and outer canthi are, respectively, the medial and lateral ends/angles of the palpebral fissure. The bicanthal plane is the transversal plane linking both canthi and defines the upper boundary of the midface. Asian eyes tend to have the inner canthus veiled by the epicanthus. In the Caucasian or double eyelid, the inner corner tends to be exposed completely. Commissures The lateral palpebral commissure (commissura palpebrarum lateralis; external canthus) is more acute than the medial, and the eyelids here lie in close contact with the bulb of the eye. The medial palpebral commissure (commissura palpebrarum medialis; internal canthus) is prolonged for a short distance toward the nose, and the two eyelids are separated by a triangular space, the lacus lacrimalis. Surgery Canthoplasty refers to a plastic surgery of the medial and/or lateral canthus. A canthotomy involves cutting the canthus, often performed to release excessive orbital pressure (i.e., from orbital hemorrhage or infection). The two canthi of each eye (medial and lateral, that is, inner and outer) are represented in cephalometric analysis by the endocanthion and exocanthion landmarks (single points
