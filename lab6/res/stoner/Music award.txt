Music award
A music award is an award or prize given for skill or distinction in music. There are different awards in different countries, and different awards may focus on or exclude certain music. For example, some music awards are only for classical music and include no popular music. Some music awards are academic, some are commercial and created by the music industry. The Big Three major music awards given each season are the American Music Awards (held in the Fall), the Grammy Awards (generally held the week after the NFL’s Super Bowl), and the Billboard Music Awards (held in the Spring). The MTV Video Music Awards (held in the Summer) could be considered, among other such award shows, a “mini-major”. A fourth major award, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony, is given in the spring (between the Grammys and the BMAs), and currently honors artists who have been in the business at least 25 years since their first hit record. Among other mini-major music awards are the Glenn Gould Prize, and Pulitzer Prize for Music.
