University railway station (England)
University railway station is a railway station serving the University of Birmingham, Birmingham Women's Hospital, and the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in the West Midlands of England. It is situated on the Cross-City Line which runs from Redditch to Lichfield via Birmingham New Street. Most services are operated by West Midlands Trains who manage the station, with some services also operated by CrossCountry. History Located on the former Birmingham West Suburban Railway, University station was built in 1977/8 to the designs of the architect John Broome as part of the upgrade of the Cross City line. The station was opened by William Rodgers, then Secretary of State for Transport, on 8 May 1978. Although this was the first station on the site, it is located a short distance away from the former Somerset Road station which was closed in the 1930s. The Cross-City Line was electrified in 1993 and the current Class 323 electric multiple units were introduced by British Rail on local services. In 2017 it was announced that University railway station would receive up to Â£10 million as an improvement fund to enhance passenger experience and reduce overcrowding as part of the Government's Midlands Engine Strategy.
