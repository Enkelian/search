The band is ranked at No. 100 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.The original line-up featured Rhoads and Garni with lead vocalist Kevin DuBrow and drummer Drew Forsyth, though that version of the band was mired by turmoil that would eventually see Garni fired for threatening to kill DuBrow. Their most commercially successful lineup consisted of DuBrow alongside guitarist Carlos Cavazo, bassist Rudy Sarzo and drummer Frankie Banali, and in 1983 released their breakthrough album Metal Health, which is known for being the first heavy metal album to top the Billboard album chart. Their hit songs include "Cum On Feel the Noize" and "Mama Weer All Crazee Now" (both cover songs of the British glam rock band Slade), and "Metal Health".
