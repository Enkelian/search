United Nations Security Council Resolution 418
United Nations Security Council Resolution 418, adopted unanimously on 4 November 1977, imposed a mandatory arms embargo against South Africa. This resolution differed from the earlier Resolution 282, which was only voluntary. The embargo was subsequently tightened and extended by Resolution 591. The embargo was lifted by Resolution 919 following democratic elections in South Africa in 1994. Impact The embargo had a direct impact on South Africa in a number of ways: Last-minute cancellation of the sale of D'Estienne d'Orves-class avisos and Agosta-class submarines by France. The cancelation of the purchase of Saar 4 class missile boat from Israel, some of which had to be built covertly in South Africa instead. South Africa's inability to purchase modern fighter aircraft to counter the air superiority of Cuban MiG-23s over the SAAF in the South African Border War. The growth of the modern day multibillion-dollar South African arms industry. The end of shipments by the United States of enriched uranium fuel for South Africa's SAFARI-1 research nuclear reactor. Circumvention of the embargo The South African government devised a number of strategies to bypass the embargo to obtain military technology and components that it was unable to procure openly.
