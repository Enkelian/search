4',7-Dihydroxyflavone is a flavone. It is found in Medicago truncatula in relation with the root nodulation symbiont Sinorhizobium meliloti or in seeds of Sophora viciifolia.Like many other flavonoids, 4',7-dihydroxyflavone has been found to possess activity at opioid receptors in vitro. Specifically, it acts as an antagonist of the μ-opioid receptor and, with lower affinity, of the κ- and δ-opioid receptors. See also Pratol (7-hydroxy-4′-methoxyflavone) is the O-methylated form of the molecule. == References ==
