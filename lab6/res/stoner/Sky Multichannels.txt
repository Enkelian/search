Sky Multichannels
Sky Multichannels was a package of analogue television channels offered by BSkyB on the Astra satellites at 19.2Â° east. from 1 September 1993 to 27 September 2001, which started off with 15 channels before expanding to over 40. History The service started on 1 September 1993 based on the idea from the then chief executive officer, Sam Chisholm and Rupert Murdoch, of converting the company business strategy to an entirely fee-based concept. The new package included four channels formerly available free-to-air, broadcasting on Astra's satellites, as well as introducing new channels. The service continued until the closure of BSkyB's analogue service on 27 September 2001, due to the expansion of the Sky Digital platform after its launch three years ago on 1 October 1998. Some of the channels did broadcast either in the clear or soft encrypted (whereby a Videocrypt decoder was required to decode, but without a subscription card) prior to their addition to the Sky Multichannels package.Within two months of the launch, Sky gained 400,000 new subscribers, with the majority taking at least one premium channel, which helped BSkyB reach 3.5 million households by mid-1994. Some channels were not launched on 1 September 1993, but were added later;
