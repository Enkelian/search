Nitrogen trichloride
Nitrogen trichloride, also known as trichloramine, is the chemical compound with the formula NCl3. This yellow, oily, pungent-smelling and explosive liquid is most commonly encountered as a byproduct of chemical reactions between ammonia-derivatives and chlorine (for example, in swimming pools). Alongside monochloramine and dichloramine, trichloramine is responsible for the distinctive 'chlorine smell' associated with swimming pools, where the compound is readily formed as a product from hypochlorous acid reacting with ammonia and other nitrogenous substances in the water. Preparation and structure The compound is prepared by treatment of ammonium salts, such as ammonium nitrate with chlorine. Intermediates in this conversion include monochloramine and dichloramine, NH2Cl and NHCl2, respectively. Like ammonia, NCl3 is a pyramidal molecule. The N-Cl distances are 1.76 Å, and the Cl-N-Cl angles are 107°. Reactions and uses The chemistry of NCl3 has been well explored. It is moderately polar with a dipole moment of 0.6 D. The nitrogen center is basic but much less so than ammonia. It is hydrolyzed by hot water to release ammonia and hypochlorous acid. NCl3 + 3 H2O → NH3 + 3 HOClNCl3 explodes to give N2 and chlorine gas. This reaction is inhibited for dilute gases. Nitrogen trichloride can form in
