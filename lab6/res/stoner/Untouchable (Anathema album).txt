Scoring high in end of year polls around the world, the album cemented Anathema's reputation as one of the most interesting bands of recent times. Following the release of the album, the band embarked on a lengthy world tour. The European part of the tour opened with a special one-off gig at the ancient Roman theatre of Philippopolis where the band were joined by the Plovdiv Philharmonic Orchestra. Untouchable captures the magic of this unique evening."
