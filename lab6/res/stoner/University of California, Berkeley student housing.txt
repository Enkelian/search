UCB Housing and Dining facilities When first built in the 1950s and 1960s, the highrise buildings of Units 1, 2, and 3 consisted of four buildings surrounding a common ground-level dining area above a mail room, recreation room, and office structure. Units 1 and 2 have many of the newest residence hall buildings.Each nine-story building is named after alumni or faculty and were originally designed for single-sex occupancy and configured with a ground floor lobby and recreation room. Each room on the floor was a double or triple occupancy. Units 1, 2, and 3 have since become co-ed although there are single-sex floors in many of the buildings. As a result of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, additional cross bracing was added to the exteriors of the older highrise Unit 1 and 2 buildings. Unit 1 The main highrise buildings of Unit 1 are located at 2650 Durant Avenue. It consists of the original halls, Cheney, Deutsch, Freeborn, and Putnam,
