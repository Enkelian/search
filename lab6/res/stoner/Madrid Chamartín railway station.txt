Madrid Chamartín railway station
Madrid Chamartín is the name of the second major railway station in Madrid, Spain. Positioned on the north side of the city, it was built between 1970 and 1975, although subsequent work would be carried on into the early 1980s. At that time it superseded Atocha station, located closer to the city centre. After Atocha itself was rebuilt in 1992, Chamartin lost much of its importance, even though since 2004 it has undergone changes to accommodate the new high-speed line to León. It hosts the railway networks connecting Madrid and north-western Spain, the AVE (high speed line) from Madrid to Segovia, Valladolid and León and many Cercanías lines (commuter rail), plus the international line to Lisbon. There are also connections with Atocha. Under the railway station there is a Metro Station (Chamartin) linking with lines 1 and 10 of the Madrid Metro, also for travelling to Madrid city centre. Placed over the Chamartín Station is the Hotel Chamartín. Renfe trains platforms and destinations Chamartin Renfe train station has 21 platforms, numbered West to East.
