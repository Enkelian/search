Spent acid
Iron(II) chloride, also known as ferrous chloride, is the chemical compound of formula FeCl2. It is a paramagnetic solid with a high melting point. The compound is white, but typical samples are often off-white. FeCl2 crystallizes from water as the greenish tetrahydrate, which is the form that is most commonly encountered in commerce and the laboratory. There is also a dihydrate. The compound is highly soluble in water, giving pale green solutions. Production Hydrated forms of ferrous chloride are generated by treatment of wastes from steel production with hydrochloric acid. Such solutions are designated "spent acid," or "pickle liquor" especially when the hydrochloric acid is not completely consumed: Fe + 2 HCl → FeCl2 + H2The spent acid requires treatment if it is disposed. Ferrous chloride is used in the manufacturing of ferric chloride. Ferrous chloride can also be used to regenerate hydrochloric acid. It is also a byproduct from titanium production, since some titanium ores contain iron. Laboratory preparation Anhydrous FeCl2 Ferrous chloride is prepared by addition of iron powder to a solution of hydrochloric acid in methanol. This reaction gives the methanol solvate of the dichloride, which upon heating in a vacuum at about 160 °C converts to
