Run for Cover (Gary Moore album)
Run for Cover is the fifth solo studio album by Irish guitarist Gary Moore, released in 1985. It is often considered his breakthrough album. The album includes the top 5 single "Out in the Fields" and a re-recording of the song "Empty Rooms", originally from Moore's previous album Victims of the Future, which became one of Moore's biggest solo successes, reaching No. 23 on the UK charts.The album features many of Moore's musical friends, including Deep Purple bassist/vocalist Glenn Hughes, Paul Thompson of Roxy Music and Phil Lynott from Thin Lizzy. Lynott and Moore trade lead vocals on "Out in the Fields", while Lynott sings alone on "Military Man", an old Grand Slam track. "Out in the Fields" is about the turmoil in their native Ireland. Lynott also provided vocals for a re-recording of the Thin Lizzy classic "Still in Love with You", on which Moore originally played guitar; the track was initially issued as a B-side of "Out in the Fields", but is included on later remastered versions of the album.
