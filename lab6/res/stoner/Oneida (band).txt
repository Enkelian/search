Oneida (band)
Oneida is an American experimental rock band from Brooklyn, New York, United States. Their influences include psychedelic rock, krautrock, electronic, noise rock, and minimalism, but the overall structure and intent of their music is not taken directly from any of these styles. Common elements found in their music include improvisation, repetition, driving rhythms, antique and analog equipment, and an overall eclecticism. History In 2001 Oneida performed at the El Macombo in Toronto with the Constantines and Grand Total.In 2002 the band released an LP, Each One Teach One, which begins with two especially long tracks, Sheets of Easter and Antibiotics, the former over fourteen minutes long, the latter more than sixteen. Both of these songs consist of one repeated riff (with a few short interludes on Antibiotics), which typifies the band's frequent use of repetition. Oneida's music can also be distinguished by the band's use of antique keyboards and analog electric pianos.The band also operates Brah Records, an imprint of Jagjaguwar. The label has released records by Dirty Faces, Parts & Labor, Oakley Hall, Home, Company, and an Oneida/Plastic Crimewave Sound split 12". In September 2007, the group celebrated 10 years of existence with a concert at the P.S. 1
