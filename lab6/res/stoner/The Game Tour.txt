The Game Tour
The Game Tour was a concert tour by the British rock band Queen to support their successful 1980 album The Game. This tour featured the first performances in South America by the group. In Buenos Aires, Queen drew a crowd of 300,000—the largest single concert crowd in Argentine history as of 1982. In São Paulo, Brazil, the attendance was 131,000 and 120,000 on two consecutive nights. This was the only tour that Queen played in Venezuela where they were due to play 5 shows in its capital city Caracas. However, after their third performance on 27 September, the Venezuelan government declared an 8-day period of National Mourning due to the passing of Venezuelan former president Romulo Betancourt. The remaining two concerts were cancelled and all tickets were refunded to more than 50,000 disappointed fans.
