Live at Montreux 2010
Live at Montreux 2010 is a live album and Blu-ray/DVD by the Northern Irish, blues rock guitarist and singer, Gary Moore. It was recorded at the Montreux Jazz Festival on 6 July 2010, and released on 19 September 2011. This would prove to be Gary Moore's last filmed performance before his death on 6 February 2011. The live performance draws mainly from the Wild Frontier album and era, as well as featuring three new songs which were planned to feature on a new Celtic-rock album, although this project never materialised due to Gary's untimely death on 6 February 2011.
