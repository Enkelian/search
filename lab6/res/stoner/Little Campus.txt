Little Campus
The Little Campus (officially the Heman Sweatt Campus) is a historic district and part of the University of Texas at Austin campus in Austin, Texas. Originally built in 1856 as the Texas Asylum for the Blind, the complex was used for a variety of purposes through the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It was acquired by the University of Texas after World War I and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. History On August 16, 1856, the Texas Legislature enacted a measure providing for the establishment of a Texas Asylum for the Blind (now known as the Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired) in Austin. The state leased the Neillâ€“Cochran House as a temporary site for the asylum while a permanent building was constructed. The asylum facility was built between 1856 and 1857 at a cost of $12,390 (equivalent to $340,000 in 2019). In 1857 the asylum moved into its building, where it operated until the end of the American Civil War in 1865, at which point the campus was commandeered by General George Armstrong Custer, who used the facility as his family's residence while contributing to the occupation and Reconstruction of Texas.In
