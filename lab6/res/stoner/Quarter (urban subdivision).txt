Quarter (urban subdivision)
A quarter is a section of an urban settlement. Its borders can be administratively chosen (then denoted as borough), and it may have its own administrative structure (subordinate to that of the city, town or other urban area). Such a division is particularly common in countries like Spain (barrio), Portugal/Brazil (bairro), Poland (dzielnica), Serbia (четврт / četvrt), Croatia (četvrt), Georgia (კვარტალი), Germany (Stadtteil), Italy (Quartiere), France (Quartier), Romania (Cartier) and Cambodia (Sangkat). Quarter can also refer to a non-administrative but distinct neighbourhood with its own character: for example, a slum quarter. It is often used for a district connected with a particular group of people: for instance, some cities are said to have Jewish quarters, diplomatic quarters or Bohemian quarters. Most Roman cities were divided to four parts, called Quarters, by their two main avenues: the Cardo and the Decumanus Maximus. The Old City of Jerusalem currently has four quarters: the Muslim Quarter, Christian Quarter, Jewish Quarter and Armenian Quarter (it used to have a Moroccan Quarter). A Christian quarter also exists in Damascus.
