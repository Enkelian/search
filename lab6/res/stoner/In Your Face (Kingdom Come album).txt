In Your Face (Kingdom Come album)
In Your Face is the second album by the band Kingdom Come. Two singles were released in support of the album, both becoming minor hits in the UK: "Do You Like It" (no. 73) and "Overrated" (no. 85). The band was due to tour the UK, supporting WASP, shortly after release of the second single, but split up before the tour commenced (ironically WASP also lost guitarist and co-founder Chris Holmes at the same time, meaning they also had to cancel the tour). A third single "Stargazer" was pressed, but never officially released. The 12" and CD single versions of "Do You Like It", includes the previously unreleased "Slow Down"; a song that did not make it onto the album. In an interview, the band's members talk about the title of the album, saying that when you first look at the LP, you read "Kingdom Come", then, as you move your eyes downwards, you read "In your face". They laugh and say: "Kingdom come ... in your face, get it?", making an obscene joke or double entendre of it.
