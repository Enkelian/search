Mathematical Sciences Research Institute
The Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) is an independent nonprofit mathematical research institution in Berkeley, California. It is widely regarded as a world leading mathematical center for collaborative research, drawing thousands of visiting researchers from around the world each year.MSRI was founded in 1982, and its funding sources include the National Science Foundation, foundations, corporations, and more than 90 universities and institutions. The Institute is located at 17 Gauss Way on the University of California, Berkeley campus, close to Grizzly Peak (on the hills overlooking Berkeley). History The Mathematical Sciences Research Institute was founded in September 1982 by three UC Berkeley professors Shiing-Shen Chern, Calvin Moore, and Isadore M. Singer. Shiing-Shen Chern acted as the founding Director of the institute and Calvin Moore acted as the founding Deputy Director. MSRI was originally located at the UC Extension Building at 2223 Fulton Street, and on April 1, 1985, MSRI moved into its current facility on Berkeley hills. Initially, MSRI paid rent for this new building to the University of California. However, since August 2000, it has occupied the building without the rental burden, as one of several contributions of the UC campus. Governance MSRI is governed by a Board of Trustees
