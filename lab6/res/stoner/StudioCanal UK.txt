StudioCanal UK
StudioCanal UK (formerly Optimum Releasing) is the official branch of StudioCanal in both the United Kingdom and Ireland. The company releases many films, including foreign, anime (mostly Studio Ghibli), independent,, art, British, Irish and American films in the United Kingdom and sometimes Ireland. History Optimum Releasing (1999–2011) When named Optimum, the company's image was that of a modern and independent distributor of new releases and back catalogues. Films were released under four strands: Optimum Releasing (new theatrical releases), Optimum Home Entertainment (new DVD and Blu-ray releases), Optimum Classic (DVD re-releases of back catalogue films), and Optimum World (new and back catalogue world cinema releases). The latter three appear still to be in use, despite the name change to StudioCanal. Optimum released over two hundred films a year and were one of the most prominent distributors in the independent film and world cinema market in the United Kingdom since the closure of Tartan Films in June 2008. Kill List, The Guard, and a re release of Whisky Galore! were the last titles released under the Optimum Releasing banner. StudioCanal UK (2011–present) In May 2006, Optimum Releasing was acquired by French film producer and distributor StudioCanal, a subsidiary of Vivendi's Canal+ Group,
