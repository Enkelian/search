Administrative divisions of San Marino
These are the 9 castelli (municipalities) of San Marino: Though it is one of the biggest towns of the Republic, Dogana is not an autonomous castello but belongs to the castello of Serravalle. Like Italian comuni, the castelli of San Marino include a main town that is the seat of the castello, called the capoluogo, and some small settlements known as frazioni or curazie.
