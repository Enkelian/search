Tennessee State Fairground Sports Arena
The Tennessee State Fairground Sports Arena is an arena in Nashville, Tennessee, on the grounds of the Tennessee State Fair. It is also known by the nickname the TNA Asylum due to the venue hosting Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA, now Impact Wrestling) events for two years in the early 2000s. History The building was constructed in 1922, by workers from South Dakota. The building was originally a flea market. It was operated throughout the 1960s and 1970s by promoter Nick Gulas as a professional wrestling venue. After taping their initial shows in the Von Braun Center in Huntsville, Alabama, then moving their next few to the Nashville Municipal Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee, TNA moved their weekly pay-per-view events to the Tennessee State Fairgrounds Sports Arena in July 2002. The name "TNA Asylum" was first used during the ninth weekly pay-per-view by Ron Killings. The Asylum also served as the home of TNA Xplosion, TNA's weekly syndicated television show, from its inception until October 2004. After debuting TNA Impact!, which was taped at Soundstage 21 at Universal Studios Florida, TNA decided that they would eventually shut down their weekly pay-per-view operations in favor of switching to a monthly pay-per-view format.
