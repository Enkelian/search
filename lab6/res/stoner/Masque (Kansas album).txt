Masque (Kansas album)
Masque is the third studio album by American progressive rock band Kansas. The album was released in October 1975 and was reissued in remastered format on CD in 2001. The album was again remastered and reissued on vinyl in 2014. The opening track, "It Takes a Woman's Love (To Make a Man)", was remixed for release as a single, but failed to gain attention. The remix included additional guest vocals and contains segments far different from the album version. Peaking at #70 on the Billboard album chart, Masque would in the months subsequent to its September 1975 release sell approximately 250,000 units. Like all three of Kansas' first three album releases, Masque attracted new commercial interest due to the platinum success of the band's fourth and fifth studio albums: Leftoverture (1976) and Point of Know Return (1977), with Masque being certified Gold for sales of 500,000 units in December 1977.
