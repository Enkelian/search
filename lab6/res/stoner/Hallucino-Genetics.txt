Hallucino-Genetics
Hallucino-Genetics: Live 2004 is the first concert DVD from Primus, released in October 2004. The show was filmed on June 26, 2004 at the Aragon Ballroom in Chicago, Illinois, the band's last show of their 2004 tour. The performance features the original recording lineup of the band performing two sets, the second of which features the band playing their first studio album Frizzle Fry in its entirety. Track listing All music is composed by Primus; all lyrics by Les Claypool. Personnel Critical reception In his review for Allmusic, Greg Prato notes that "despite a lengthy absence from the concert trail, Primus is as wild 'n' wacky as ever, and not afraid to veer off into an extended jam on a moment's notice." He contends that "the Frizzle Fry portion certainly doesn't disappoint", elaborating that "while sonically the set is top-notch, the camera work could have been better... few front shots of drummer Alexander are included, so there is no clear view of what he's playing most of the time", but concludes that "these complaints are small; Hallucino-Genetics Live 2004 is a faithful representation of the group's reunion tour." == References ==
