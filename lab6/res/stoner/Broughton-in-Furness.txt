Broughton-in-Furness
Broughton in Furness is a small market town on the south western boundary of England's Lake District National Park. It is located in the Furness region of Cumbria, which was originally part of Lancashire before 1974. History Broughton in Furness is mentioned in the Domesday Book as one of the townships forming the Manor of Hougun held by Tostig Godwinson, Earl of Northumbria. Dating from around the eleventh century, the original settlement grew to become the local market town for both fishing and agriculture. Wool was particularly important for the town's development. The town was given a charter in 1575. Market Square was formally laid out in 1760 by John Gilpin Sawrey, the Lord of the Manor, who lived at Broughton Tower,a large mansion just a short distance from the Square. In the 1990s the A595 road was diverted in an attempt to improve the environment of the town and help it retain its rural feel. Governance With Cumbria having retained its two-tier local authority structure, Broughton is located within the Cumbria County Council and the South Lakeland District Council areas. In 1976 the parishes of Broughton West, Seathwaite with Dunnerdale, and Angerton were merged, creating Duddon Parish Council. Geography
