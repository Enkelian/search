SNL Studios
SNL Studios is a production company, founded in July 1997 as a joint venture between Saturday Night Live executive producer Lorne Michaels and NBC Studios (now Universal Television). While this venture also initially included Paramount Pictures, it was dissolved following NBC's merger with Universal Studios. On the television side, SNL Studios produces Saturday Night Live in association with Broadway Video. Film productions, typically offshoots of Saturday Night Live' sketches, include, among others, A Night at the Roxbury and Superstar. Following the announcement of the creation of SNL Studios, veteran Saturday Night Live producer Marci Klein was named as the president of SNL Studios Television in December 1999, while Richard Feldman was appointed head of SNL Studios Films in June of the same year.
