The lyrics were written by Burton C. Bell and Dino Cazares. Bell explained the lyrics to illustrate that: "Change is an inevitable course in nature and humanity. This world has seen much change as of late, and it is true globally, nationally, and personally. This is a true story of a personal struggle against a controlling and ineffectual organization. There is always a choice, and the choice is never easy." == References ==
