Galina Brezhneva
Galina Leonidovna Brezhneva (Russian: Галина Леонидовна Брежнева; 18 April 1929 – 30 June 1998) was the daughter of Soviet politician and longtime General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev and Viktoria Brezhneva. Life and death Galina Brezhneva was born on 18 April 1929 in Sverdlovsk. As a teenager she refused to become a member of the Komsomol; later, she refused to study for an academic degree. She was married briefly to Igor Kio, a union that lasted only nine days. By 1971, her father Leonid Brezhnev had become displeased with the way things were going in Galina's life. He wanted to arrange a marriage for her, after having her second marriage annulled. She ended up selecting Yuri Churbanov from a number of suitors. Churbanov was chosen even though he was already married and had children. By the end of Brezhnev's life, Galina was much less visible, and during the reign of Yuri Andropov, she disappeared from the public eye altogether. Brezhneva made a public comeback during Konstantin Chernenko's short rule, and appeared in a conference commemorating International Women's Day. At the conference, she wore only one piece of jewelry, the Order of Lenin that she had been awarded by Andrei Gromyko in 1978
