Annenberg TV News, or ATVN, is a student-produced 30-minute nightly news program serving the University of Southern California student body and Downtown Los Angeles. ATVN airs live at 5:30 p.m. Monday through Wednesday during the school year on YouTube and Trojan Vision, the school's on campus television network. Annenberg TV News is a product of USC Annenberg Media, a student-led media organization that is part of USC's journalism program. Background Founded in September 1998, ATVN gives students hands-on broadcast and multimedia journalism skills that make graduates competitive in media operations across the country. In 2016, Annenberg TV News moved from ATVN.org to USC Annenberg Media, a multiplatform news organization that is part of USC Annenberg's journalism school. Regardless of major or class standing, ATVN invites all students to volunteer in the newsroom and studio as assignment desk editors, multimedia journalists, anchors and reporters. Many journalism classes require students to work a shift for USC Annenberg Media to supplement their in-class learning. Every semester, a new staff of students takes command of the newscast. Students learn to make editorial decisions under deadline pressure, produce original stories and use studio equipment found in professional newsrooms and studios. These programs include Avid iNews,
