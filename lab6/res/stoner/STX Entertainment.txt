In April 2018, it was reported that the company was eyeing an initial public offering on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange that could value it at US$3.5 billion. In October 2018, STX reported it had abandoned the IPO, as conditions had deteriorated in Hong Kong due to turbulence in mainland Chinese equity markets and the U.S.-China trade war. History Founding In 2012, Simonds and McGlashan began conceptualizing a media company based on the idea of producing medium-budget projects with a star attached, a method that had gone out of style with Hollywood studios. The conversation led to the launch of STX Entertainment in 2014 with the mission to finance, develop, produce, market and self-distribute star-driven content around the world.
