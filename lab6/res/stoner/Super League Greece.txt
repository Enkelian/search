Super League Greece
The Super League Greece (Greek: Ελληνική Σούπερ Λίγκα) or Super League 1, is the highest professional football league in Greece. The league was formed on 16 July 2006 and replaced Alpha Ethniki at the top of the Greek football league system. It consists of 14 teams and runs from August to May, with teams playing 26 games each. As of September 2019, Super League Greece is ranked 15th in the UEFA ranking of leagues, based on performances in European competitions over the last five years. Since the foundation of the first official Panhellenic Championship in 1927, only six clubs have won the title, with the "POK" (Olympiacos, Panathinaikos and AEK Athens) dominating and only PAOK, Aris and AEL managing to break their dominance on few occasions. The current champions are PAOK, based in Thessaloniki. History Origins Between 1905 and 1912, a Panhellenic Championship was organised by the Hellenic Association of Amateur Athletics (SEGAS). This championship was actually a local tournament among clubs from Athens and Piraeus. After the Balkan Wars and World War I, two football associations were formed, one organising a football league in Athens and Piraeus, and one doing the same in Thessaloniki. These were the Athens-Piraeus FCA
