Symphony Hall (Sirius XM)
Symphony Hall is a Sirius XM Radio station featuring exclusively classical music. It is located on Sirius XM Radio channel 76 and DISH Network channel 6076. Originally Sirius only, it was merged with the XM Classics channel on November 12, 2008. Martin Goldsmith (former longtime host of the then-National Public Radio program Performance Today), Preston Trombly, Robert Aubry Davis, Lauren Rico, John Clare and Vincent Caruso are the channel's current on-air voices. Special programs include Millennium of Music, Vox Choral, Baroque and Beyond, and the Radio Netherlands Worldwide program Live at the Concertgebouw. The channel also carried the syndicated daily program Exploring Music prior to April 2010. Between 12 AM and 6 AM (ET), the channel's programming consists of automated classical music selections, with no on-air hosts. Since the Sirius XM merger, Symphony Hall competed with Sirius XM Pops for classical music listeners. However, on July 10, 2014, Sirius XM announced Sirius XM Pops would close and merge with Symphony Hall. This leaves Symphony Hall as the only classical station on Sirius XM. The internet player, however, can bias the station to not play any 20th century to present classical music. The former Sirius XM Pops station is still available
