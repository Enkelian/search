Yom Kippur
Yom Kippur (; Hebrew: יוֹם כִּיפּוּר, IPA: [ˈjom kiˈpuʁ], or יום הכיפורים), also known as the Day of Atonement, is the holiest day of the year in Judaism. Its central themes are atonement and repentance. Jews traditionally observe this holy day with an approximate 25-hour period of fasting and intensive prayer, often spending most of the day in synagogue services. Etymology Yom (יוֹם) means 'day' in Hebrew and Kippur (כִּפּוּר) comes from a root that means 'to atone'. Yom Kippur is usually expressed in English as "Day of Atonement". Kippur can also mean to cleanse, with the Yom Kippur procedures in the Temple cleansing the people of sin.
