EuroAtlantic Airways
EuroAtlantic Airways, legally EuroAtlantic Airways – Transportes Aéreos S.A., is a Portuguese airline specialized in leasing and air charter headquartered in Sintra and based at Lisbon Airport. History Founded as Air Zarco on 25 August 1993, the company adopted the trade name Air Madeira until 17 May 2000, when the Memorandum of Association was altered by deed, and the name of EuroAtlantic Airways – Transportes Aéreos S.A. was adopted. EuroAtlantic also took over the corporate design from Air Zarco which is still used today. The airline was founded by Portuguese businessman Tomaz Metello, who was the owner of the airline until 2019. It was sold to the Luxembourg group Imperial Jet, led by German-Lebanese pilot and businessman Abed El-Jaouni. EuroAtlantic also owns 38% of the national airline of São Tomé and Príncipe, STP Airways. EuroAtlantic operated a direct flight from Lisbon to Dili's Presidente Nicolau Lobato International Airport in January 2008 using a Boeing 767 carrying 140 members of the Portuguese National Guard. It was the first aircraft larger than a Boeing 737 to ever land at the airport. EuroAtlantic was known for operating the last Lockheed L-1011 TriStar in passenger service in Europe. It was phased out in March
