2018 Los Angeles Chargers season
The 2018 season was the Los Angeles Chargers' 49th as a member of the National Football League, their 59th overall, their 3rd in the Greater Los Angeles Area and their second under head coach Anthony Lynn. Despite a slow 1–2 start, the Chargers improved on their 9–7 record from last year with a Week 14 win over the Cincinnati Bengals. They also recorded a 10-win season for the first time since 2009 when they were in San Diego, also their first as a Los Angeles based team since 1960. With a Week 15 win over the Kansas City Chiefs, the Chargers clinched their first playoff berth since 2013 when they were based in San Diego. The Chargers finished 12–4, tied with the Chiefs for both the AFC West division title and the best record in the AFC. However, the Chiefs won the division and the AFC's No. 1 seed based on record vs. division opponents (5–1 to 4–2), giving the Chargers the Wild Card and the AFC's No. 5 seed. The Chargers defeated the Baltimore Ravens 23–17 in the Wild Card round, but lost to the eventual Super Bowl Champion New England Patriots 41–28 in the Divisional round. Offseason Roster
