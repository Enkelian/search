École nationale supérieure de mécanique et des microtechniques
The École Nationale Supérieure de Mécanique et des Microtechniques (ENSMM) is a French school of engineering. It is part of Polyméca, a network of schools focusing on mechanical engineering. History The school was founded in 1902 by the Université de Franche-Comté as Laboratoire de Chronométrie. In 1961, it turned to École nationale supérieure de chronométrie et micromécanique (ENSCM). Since the school is established in an area with a strong legacy on horology, ENSMM is deeply dedicated to the design and manufacturing of micro-mechanical devices and robotics. Location It is located in the city of Besançon, France eastern area (4 hours from Paris, 2 hours and a half from Strasbourg and 2 hours and a half from Lyon). Curriculum Study in France The school educates 250 engineers every year on 6 fields: Materials science Mechatronics Mechanical engineering Micromechanics Optoelectronics and Microelectromechanical systems Industrial engineeringStudents can choose to spend their last year within ENSMM or in one of the schools of the Polyméca network. Study abroad The ENSMM has concluded a partnership with several universities worldwilde: Technische Universität, Vienne, Austria Institut National d’Informatique, Alger, Algeria Federal University of Uberlândia, Brazil Universidade Polytechnique, São Paulo, Brazil École Polytechnique de Montréal, Montréal, Canada École
