Volcano (Jimmy Buffett song)
"Volcano" is a song performed by American popular music singer-songwriter Jimmy Buffett. It was written by Jimmy Buffett, Keith Sykes, and Harry Dailey and released as a single (b/w "Stranded on a Sandbar") on MCA 41161 in November 1979. It was first released on his 1979 album Volcano. It reached #66 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #43 on the Easy Listening chart. This song was originally a minor hit. The song and album are named for the then-dormant Soufrière Hills volcano on the island of Montserrat in the British West Indies where Buffett recorded the album in May 1979 at AIR Studios. The studio was destroyed by Hurricane Hugo in 1989 and Soufrière Hills erupted again in 1995. The lyrics describe the narrator's anxiety about his possible whereabouts following the impending eruption of a volcano. The bridge before the final chorus mentions a number of placenames, some important largely in the context of 1979: But I don't want to land in New York City,I don't want to land in Mexico. I don't want to land on no Three Mile Island, I don't want to see my skin a-glow. Don't want to land in Camanche Skypark, or in Nashville, Tennessee.
