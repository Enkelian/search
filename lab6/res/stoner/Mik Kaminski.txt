Mik Kaminski
Michael Kaminski (born 2 September 1951) is an English musician. He is best known for playing violin in the rock band Electric Light Orchestra (ELO) between 1973 and 1979. Early life Kaminski was born in Harrogate, North Yorkshire. He made his first professional performance with the Leeds Orchestra, when he was 14. During his time at the Leeds School of Music, he founded the band Cow, together with his friends John Hodgson (drums) and John Marcangelo (keyboards and percussion). Career In 1973 he joined Joe Soap and played violin on their Keep It Clean album. Their producer Sandy Roberton suggested Kaminski to Andy Roberts, who needed a violinist for his album. Thus Kaminski played in 1973 on Roberts' Andy Roberts and The Grand Stampede.After those albums Kaminski applied for the vacant post as ELO's violinist because of an advertisement in Melody Maker. He was recruited after two interviews and was also the only one who didn't play a bum note when bandleader Jeff Lynne held the audition.During his stint in ELO, Kaminski initially tried to imitate his predecessor Wilf Gibson by wearing a cape while playing the violin, but soon acquired his trademark blue violin, which he has played variants
