History of Saturday Night Live (1990–1995)
Saturday Night Live is an American sketch comedy series created and produced by Lorne Michaels for most of the show's run. The show has aired on NBC since 1975. The 1990–91 season brought the first major changes to the show's cast in over four years, adding cast members such as Chris Farley and David Spade. As the previous cast slowly left, the new players began to take over. With most of the older cast gone, Michaels attempted to push a mix of old (Kevin Nealon, Mike Myers) and new (Janeane Garofalo, Michael McKean) for the 1994–95 season's cast. This season is widely considered one of the show's worst (along with the 1980–81 and 1985–86 seasons). After this cast, Michaels replaced most of the cast with unknowns for the 1995–96 season, once again saving the show from cancellation. Transition in progress (1990–1991) The 1990–91 season was a transitional year. Jon Lovitz and Nora Dunn left the show after the previous season, the latter in a cloud of controversy. Lorne Michaels introduced a number of players who quickly became stars on the show: Chris Farley, Tim Meadows, Chris Rock, Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider, David Spade, and Julia Sweeney.
