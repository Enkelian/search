College Theological Society (Trinity College Dublin)
The College Theological Society, more commonly known as The Theo, was founded in 1830 as a student society in Trinity College Dublin in Ireland. Members gather weekly throughout the term to engage in debate and listen to guest speakers in the Graduates Memorial Building. Society The society's original purpose was to provide a forum for the discussion of Philosophical Theology for students of Trinity College Dublin. Since then, it has expanded to include the consideration of various religious topics in a way that appeals to the general student body. With strong ties to the School of Religions and Theology, all of Trinity's students of Religion are encouraged to become active members of the society. Its primary aim is to promote interreligious dialogue with a focus on topical issues. Guests of the society have ranged from prestigious academics to celebrated authors to successful politicians and organisational figures, all of whom speak on a wide range of subjects. The society frequently touches upon the role of religion within world society and has covered themes including Human Rights, Current Affairs, and Environmental and Social Responsibility. Other events hosted by the society include film screenings, debates, quizzes, parties and an annual trip to Dunderry
