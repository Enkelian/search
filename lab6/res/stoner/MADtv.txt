MADtv
Mad TV (stylized as MADtv) is an American sketch comedy television series originally inspired by Mad magazine. Antecedents The series was based loosely on Mad magazine, a property owned by Time Warner Entertainment (parent of series distributor WB Television Distribution) through its DC Comics subsidiary. From the magazine, the show featured animated Spy vs. Spy and Don Martin shorts, as well as recurring images of longtime Mad mascot Alfred E. Neuman in earlier seasons, though the live-action sketches had no relation to the magazine's content. Launch The first broadcast was October 14, 1995. The one-hour show first-ran on Saturday nights on Fox and was in syndication on Comedy Central. In Australia, the show screened on satellite and cable TV channel The Comedy Channel and in late-night timeslots on free-to-air broadcaster the Nine Network and its affiliates. Mad TV was created by Fax Bahr and Adam Small. The series was originally produced by Bahr/Small Productions and Quincy Jones/David Salzman Entertainment (QDE). After Bahr and Small left the series at the end of the third season (they were later credited as "executive consultants"), the series was handled by QDE and distributed by WB Television Distribution. The series was directed by Bruce Leddy
