Latitude Festival
The Latitude Festival is an annual music festival that takes place in Henham Park, near Southwold, Suffolk, England. It was first held in July 2006 and has been held every year since. The festival includes a comprehensive bill of musicians, bands and artists across four stages - the Obelisk Arena, the BBC Sounds Arena, the Sunrise Arena and the Lake Stage. The festival also comprises elements of theatre, art, comedy, cabaret, poetry, politics, dance and literature. The festival is run by Festival Republic (formerly the Mean Fiddler Group), which also runs the Reading and Leeds festivals and up until 2013 was contracted to run Glastonbury Festival. The festival has a sister festival called Longitude Festival.

Burglaries from more than 40 tents were subsequently reported to Suffolk Police. Inadequate security, including a decision by festival organisers, Mean Fiddler Music Group, not to engage a police presence on site for the duration of the festival attracted a degree of criticism.
