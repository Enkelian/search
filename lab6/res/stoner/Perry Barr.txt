Perry Barr
Perry Barr is a suburban area in north Birmingham, England. It is also the name of a council constituency, managed by its own district committee. Birmingham Perry Barr is also a parliamentary constituency; its Member of Parliament is Khalid Mahmood. The constituency includes the smaller Perry Barr ward, and the wards of Handsworth Wood, Lozells and East Handsworth, and Oscott, which each elect three councillors to Birmingham City Council. Etymology "Perry" means small, and is derived from the Latin parva (not "pear", as some sources claim) and "Barr" means "hill". The name probably relates to the adjacent Great Barr, including Barr Beacon, the area's tallest peak. History Perry Barr was originally two separate entities, both mentioned in the Domesday Book as 'Pirio' and 'Barre'. Pirio is recorded as having an estimated population of 35 and Barre with an estimated population of 25. William FitzAnsculf is recorded as being the tenant in chief of both manors, and Drogo as the tenant. It is thought that the two manors may have been combined in the Early Middle Ages. In 1874 Perry Barr established its own institute based on the model of the Birmingham and Midland Institute. Aston Villa opened their Wellington Road
