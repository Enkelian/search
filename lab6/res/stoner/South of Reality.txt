South of Reality
South of Reality is the second studio album by The Claypool Lennon Delirium consisting of American multi-instrumentalists Sean Lennon and Primus' Les Claypool, released on February 22, 2019. Background The album was preceded by the lead single and music video for "Blood and Rockets," followed by two successive prerelease tracks; "Easily Charmed by Fools" in late 2018, and "Amethyst Realm" in early 2019. Reception The album received generally positive reviews from music critics, with a rating of 78 based on 7 reviews at Metacritic, surpassing the score of 70 received by their debut LP Monolith of Phobos. Critics praised the album's unusual sound and improvement from their debut project: Paste magazine awarded the album an 8.5/10 writing "South of Reality is weird. Itâ€™s unorthodox... That's what makes the album so damn great." AllMusic noted that "If the duo's satire sometimes seems cheap -- the Tinder jibes on "Easily Charmed by Fools" are a little too easy -- they make up for it through sheer good humor, which is why the playfulness of South of Reality charms instead of alienates." Uncut called the album "A meaty maximalist feast, richer and riper than its predecessor." Track listing All tracks are written by
