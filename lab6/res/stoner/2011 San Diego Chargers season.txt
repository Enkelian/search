2011 San Diego Chargers season
The 2011 San Diego Chargers season was the franchise's 42nd season in the National Football League and the 52nd overall. The team failed to improve on its 9–7 record from 2010, and finished in a three-way tie with the Denver Broncos and Oakland Raiders for the AFC West division title, with an 8–8 record, but lost the tiebreaker to the Broncos and missed the playoffs for a second consecutive season. For Norv Turner, this was his fifth season as the head coach of the Chargers. The Chargers had the 18th pick in the 2011 NFL Draft. Offseason Coaching changes On January 11, defensive coordinator Ron Rivera became the new head coach of the Carolina Panthers. That same day, Rich Bisacchia was named the team's new special teams' coach, replacing Steve Crosby, whose contract was not renewed. Three days later (January 14), the team hired former San Francisco 49ers' defensive coordinator Greg Manusky to replace Rivera. Manusky previously served as the Chargers' linebackers coach from 2002–2006.
