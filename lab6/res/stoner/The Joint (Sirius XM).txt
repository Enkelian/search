The Joint (Sirius XM)
The Joint is a Reggae music channel on Sirius XM Radio channel 42 and on Dish Network channel 6042. Sirius XM describes the channel as "Our Foundation Is The Roots" and primarily airs non-mainstream reggae artists. The Joint is one of the few "World" music channels on Sirius XM. Until September 2008, The Joint was on XM channel 101 before moving to channel 95. On November 12, 2008, the channel replaced Reggae Rhythms, which was on Sirius, and in addition, it moved to its current channel position on the XM side. Mediabase still lists the channel as X101-FM. As of April 2009, The Joint has changed its logo from that which is shown above to the word "Joint" in all capital letters (except for the I) with a red, yellow, and green rainbow behind it. The logo also features a lion to the right of the word "Joint." The station is named after a slang term for a cannabis cigarette, referring to the popularity of cannabis in Jamaica. == References ==
