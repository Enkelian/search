On the Highwire
On the Highwire is a compilation album by English rock band Trapeze. Released on 2 December 2003 by Castle Communications, the album features all tracks from the band's 1979 sixth and final studio album Hold On, the 1998 live album Live: Way Back to the Bone and the 1981 live album Live in Texas: Dead Armadillos. Reception AllMusic writer Greg Prato claimed that "since On the Highwire skips the group's studio work with Hughes (which is by far the group's strongest work), [it] fails to deliver as a true career overview", noting that the first disc "falls a bit flat" but adding that the second "fares much better, as it focuses on much stronger material".
