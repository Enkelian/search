Bohemian
A Bohemian () is a resident of Bohemia, a region of the Czech Republic or the former Kingdom of Bohemia, a region of the former Crown of Bohemia (lands of the Bohemian Crown). In English, the word "Bohemian" was used to denote the Czech people as well as the Czech language before the word "Czech" became prevalent in the early 20th century.In a separate meaning, "Bohemian" may also denote "a socially unconventional person, especially one who is involved in the arts" according to Oxford Dictionaries Online. (See Bohemianism). Etymology The name "Bohemia" derives from the name of the Boii, a Celtic tribe who inhabited the area towards the latter La Tène period (1st century BC). The toponym Boiohaemum, first attested by Tacitus around AD 98, is taken to mean "home of the Boii" (from the Germanic root *haima- "world, home"). The word "Bohemian" has never been widely used by the Czech population. In Czech language, the region since the early Middle Ages has been called Čechy but also, especially during the period of restoration/emancipation of the Czech language and nation, as Čechie. Another term, stressing the importance of the state/nation, was Království české ("Czech Kingdom"), or Böhmen (Königreich) in German.
