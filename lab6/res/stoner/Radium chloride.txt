Radium chloride
Radium chloride (RaCl2) is a salt of radium and chlorine, and the first radium compound isolated in a pure state. Marie Curie and André-Louis Debierne used it in their original separation of radium from barium. The first preparation of radium metal was by the electrolysis of a solution of this salt using a mercury cathode. Preparation Radium chloride crystallises from solution as the dihydrate. It may be dehydrated by heating to 100 °C in air for one hour followed by ​5 1⁄2 hours at 520 °C under argon. If the presence of other anions is suspected, the dehydration may be effectuated by fusion under hydrogen chloride.Radium chloride can also be prepared by heating radium bromide in a flow of dry hydrogen chloride gas, or can be isolated from uranium and thorium ores by treating radium sulfate with sodium carbonate,leaving radium carbonate and then reacting the radium carbonate in hydrochloric acid. Properties Radium chloride is a colorless-white salt with a blue-green luminescence, especially when heated. Its color gradually changes to yellow with aging, whereas contamination by barium may impart a rose tint. It is less soluble in water than other alkaline earth metal chlorides – at 25 °C its solubility is
