Dani Bouzas
Daniel 'Dani' Bouzas Pan (born 21 January 1974) is a Spanish retired footballer who played as a right midfielder. Football career Born in Arteixo, Province of A Coruña, Galicia, Bouzas made his professional debuts in 1994 with Sporting de Gijón, being irregularly used over the course of two-and-a-half La Liga seasons. In December 1996 he moved to the second division with Albacete Balompié, again with inconsistent results – he only played 16 matches out of 42 in his final year. Bouzas returned to the top level again, signing with Rayo Vallecano, but only appeared five times in his two-season spell, which also included a loan at CD Toledo. His career would then be resumed in the third division, with CD Castellón, CD Logroñés (two years), CD Linares (five) and Deportivo Alavés. External links Dani Bouzas at BDFutbol
