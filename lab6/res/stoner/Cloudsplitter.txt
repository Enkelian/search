Cloudsplitter
Cloudsplitter is a 1998 historical novel by Russell Banks relating the story of abolitionist John Brown.The novel is narrated as a retrospective by John Brown's son, Owen Brown, from his hermitage in the San Gabriel Mountains of California. His reminiscences are triggered by the reception of an invitation from a Miss Mayo, assistant to Oswald Garrison Villard, then researching his book John Brown: A Biography Fifty Years After (Boston, 1910). Major themes Banks raises a number of thematic questions during the lengthy portrayal of his subject matter. Notable among them are: How emotional attachment and hermetic exile provide for an unreliable narration. The moral consequences of Radicalism: violent vs. non-violent protest. The fine line between sanity and religious fanaticism: "...the Lord speaks to me." How strong familial attachment is itself a form of slavery. Loss of innocence. Your actions affect those around you (John Brown with his family and friends).The narrative style employed by Banks is introspective and apologetic where each character's moral compass is seen as through the microscope of Owen Brown's telling; detailed and larger than life. Bank's prose uses language that registers on the psyche: evoking the conviction that redemption can be gained by an Augustinian confession.
