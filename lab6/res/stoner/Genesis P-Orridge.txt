Genesis Breyer P-Orridge (22 February 1950 â€“ 14 March 2020) was an English singer-songwriter, musician, poet, performance artist, and occultist.

P-Orridge preferred gender-neutral pronouns when being described.Born in Manchester as Neil Andrew Megson, P-Orridge developed an early interest in art, occultism, and the avant-garde while at Solihull School.
