The style of music early on was instrumental with a strong leaning towards rhythmic psychedelic rock/trance. The addition of vocals to Moss’s abilities in 1996 led to a shift in musical direction, where the writing turned to dark, melodic acoustic rock. During this period he wrote and recorded key tracks ‘Over Your Shoulder’, ‘Saviour’, ‘Too Late’ and ‘Angel’ (later re-titled to ‘Angelic’).Antimatter was formed in 1998 when Duncan Patterson (then of Anathema) approached Moss to record an album with him after hearing Moss's demos which bore a striking resemblance to his own newer material on Anathema's 'Alternative 4' album (neither party had heard the others latest material).
