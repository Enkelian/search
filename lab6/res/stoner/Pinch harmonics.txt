Pinch harmonics
Playing a string harmonic is a string instrument technique that uses the nodes of natural harmonics of a musical string to produce high pitched tones of varying timbre and loudness. Playing string harmonics produces "high pitched tones, like a whistle's, are produced when the musician lightly touches certain points on a string." "A flute-like sound produced on a string instrument by lightly touching the string with the finger instead of pressing it down," against the fingerboard (without stopping). Overtones When a string is plucked normally, the ear hears the fundamental frequency most prominently, but the overall sound is also colored by the presence of various overtones (frequencies greater than the fundamental frequency). The fundamental frequency and its overtones are perceived by the listener as a single note; however, different combinations of overtones give rise to noticeably different overall tones (see timbre). A harmonic overtone has evenly spaced nodes along the string, where the string does not move from its resting position. Nodes The nodes of natural harmonics are located at the following points along the string: Above, the length fraction is the point, with respect to the length of the whole string, the string is lightly touched.
