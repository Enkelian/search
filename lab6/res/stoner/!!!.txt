The band's eighth album, Wallop, was released in August 2019. Background and history !!! is an American band formed in the fall of 1996 by the merger of members of the groups Black Liquorice and Popesmashers. After a successful joint tour, the two bands decided to mix the disco-funk with more aggressive sounds and integrate the hardcore singer Nic Offer from the Yah Mos. The band's name was inspired by the subtitles of the movie The Gods Must Be Crazy, in which the clicking sounds of the Bushmen's Khoisan language were represented as "!". However, as the bandmembers themselves say, !!! is pronounced by repeating thrice any monosyllabic sound. "Chk Chk Chk" is the most common pronunciation, and the URL of their official website and the title of their Myspace page suggest it is the preferred pronunciation. The band's full-length debut record came out in 2000 as a self-titled album on the label Gold Standard
