Fogerty, however, has stated in interviews that the song was actually written for his then three-year-old son, Josh. Fogerty has also said that the reference to a parade passing by was inspired by the Dr. Seuss book And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street.Country singer Buck Owens is mentioned in the song, and the music reflects some of the Bakersfield sound Owens made famous.
