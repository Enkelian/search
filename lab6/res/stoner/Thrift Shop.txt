Thrift Shop
"Thrift Shop" is a song by American hip hop duo Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, featuring vocals from American singer Wanz. It was released on August 27, 2012 as Macklemore's eighth career single and the fourth single from their debut studio album, The Heist (2012). The song's lyrics show Macklemore's esteem for thrift shops and saving money, rather than flaunting expensive items like many rappers. Many music reviewers praised the song for its humorous lyrics and social critique. Despite being released on Macklemore's independent label with distribution by the Alternative Distribution Alliance (ADA), a Warner Music Group company, the single was a sleeper hit. It reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 and has since sold over 6 million copies in the US alone. The song also reached number one in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, France, Denmark, Netherlands, Australia and New Zealand. A music video was released simultaneously with the song on August 29, 2012, and has had more than 1.4 billion views on YouTube as of March 2020.
