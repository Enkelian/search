The entrance to the hospital was on what is now Bull Street, then Chapel Street, and ran along Steelhouse Lane, then Priory Congree. In 1536, the Priory was dissolved and the structures on site were demolished in 1547. The site remained as ruins for 150 years until it was purchased by John Pemberton in 1700.
