WTMO-CD
WTMO-CD, virtual and UHF digital channel 31, is a low-powered, Class A Telemundo owned-and-operated television station licensed to Orlando, Florida, United States. The station is owned by the Telemundo Station Group subsidiary of NBCUniversal (itself a subsidiary of Comcast). WTMO-CD's transmitter is located on Lake Sparling Road in Pine Hills. WTMO-CD is simulcast on the third digital subchannel of independent station WRDQ (channel 27, owned by Cox Media Group), as well as on translators WKME-CD (channel 15) in Kissimmee, and WMVJ-CD (channel 29) in Melbourne.

Until early 2006 at the latest, it was located on channel 40, but moved to channel 15 shortly before WACX signed on its digital signal on channel 40. Based in Kissimmee, this signal is far enough away with a directional pattern towards Kissimmee, so it would not interfere with WCEU (now WDSC-TV), which also broadcasts on channel 15. As a result, channel 15's coverage area only covers Kissimmee, forcing WTMO to reach the rest of the Orlando area via cable. In late 2006, ZGS acquired WDYB, WMVJ, and the channel 31 license (then WPXG-LP) from Tiger Eye Broadcasting to expand WTMO's
