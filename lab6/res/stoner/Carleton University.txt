Carleton University
Carleton University is a public comprehensive university in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Founded in 1942 as Carleton College, a private, non-denominational evening college to serve veterans returning from World War II, the institution was chartered as a university by the provincial government in 1952 through The Carleton University Act. The legislation was subsequently amended in 1957 to give the institution its current name. The university moved to its current campus in 1959, expanding rapidly throughout the 1960s amid broader efforts by the provincial government to increase support to post-secondary institutions and enhance access to higher education. The university is named for the now-dissolved Carleton County, which included the city of Ottawa at the time the university was founded. Carleton County, in turn, was named in honour of Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester, who served as Governor General of The Canadas from 1786 to 1796. Carleton, which has more than 159,000 alumni worldwide, is reputed for its strength in many disciplines including the humanities, international business, aerospace engineering, computer science, international affairs, journalism, political science, political management, public policy and administration, and legal studies. Carleton has produced 6 Rhodes Scholars, 29 Royal Society Fellows, 20 recipients of the Order of Canada, 8
