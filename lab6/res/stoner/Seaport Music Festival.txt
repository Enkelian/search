Seaport Music Festival
Seaport Music Festival is an international music festival staged at South Street Seaport in lower Manhattan during the summer. Founded in 2002, the annual music series is recognized for presenting a plethora of indie music's most relevant breaking and established bands—indie veterans to critically acclaimed newcomers—from around the globe. Overview Featuring national and international artists, SMF concerts (past and present) draw crowds of 7,500-plus fans who turn out to see bands not widely recognized by the general public. Yet, the sizes of the audiences are a testament to the sophistication of the indie music crowd in New York City. In its 16-year history, SMF has become a gateway for new bands to break into other larger New York festivals in subsequent summers. The once “new” artists who made SMF their first free large outdoor concert in New York City reads like a who's who of indie music. They include The xx, Deerhunter, Joanna Newsom, Au Revoir Simone, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, Sufjan Stevens, The Polyphonic Spree, Juana Molina, Benjy Ferree, Hot Chip, Oppenheimer, Camera Obscura, Bishop Allen, Tokyo Police Club, Devotchka, Atlas Sound, Spinto Band, Dirty on Purpose, Dr. Dog, Menomena, Oneida, No Age, and Telepathe, among others.
