Mamitu
Mamitu, also known as Mammetun, Mammetum, or Mammitu was the ancient Akkadian goddess of fate and destiny. She was believed to reside in Irkalla and decree the fates of all human beings based on arbitrary whims. Nonetheless, whatever decrees she issued were irrevocable. She was also worshipped as goddess of the oath, later a chthonic goddess of fate and a judge in the underworld, similar to the Anunnaki. She is occasionally regarded as a consort of Nergal. In some passages, she is also known as a demon of irrevocable curses. == References ==
