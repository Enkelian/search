Tusmore, Oxfordshire
Tusmore is a settlement about 5 1⁄2 miles (9 km) north of Bicester in Oxfordshire. It is the location of the Tusmore country house and estate. Manor Tusmore was settled in Saxon times. The toponym comes from Old English, either Thures mere ("Thur's pool") or Þyrsmere ("a lake haunted by a giant or demon").The Domesday Book records that in 1086 the manor of Tusmore belonged to Walter Giffard, 1st Earl of Buckingham.By the early part of the 14th century Tusmore was the poorest village in the Ploughley Hundred. Thereafter it was depopulated by the Black Death. By 1358 the village had been abandoned and Sir Roger de Cotesford was licensed to enclose the abandoned land. The fact that Tusmore was not required to pay tax in 1428 indicates that by then it had fewer than ten householders.The Fermor family were lords of the manor of Tusmore from 1606 until 1828, and Tusmore House was their family seat from about 1625 until 1810. In 1828 the last William Fermor died without a male heir and left the estate to his adopted daughter and her husband, John and Maria Turner Ramsay. In 1857 the Ramsays sold the estate to Henry Howard, 2nd
