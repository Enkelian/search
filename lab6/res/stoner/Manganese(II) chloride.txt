Manganese(II) chloride
Manganese(II) chloride is the dichloride salt of manganese, MnCl2. This inorganic chemical exists in the anhydrous form, as well as the dihydrate (MnCl2·2H2O) and tetrahydrate MnCl2·4H2O), with the tetrahydrate being the most common form. Like many Mn(II) species, these salts are pink, with the paleness of the color being characteristic of transition metal complexes with high spin d5 configurations. Preparation Manganese chloride is produced by treating manganese(IV) oxide with concentrated hydrochloric acid. MnO2 + 4 HCl → MnCl2 + 2 H2O + Cl2This reaction was once used for the manufacture of chlorine. By carefully neutralizing the resulting solution with MnCO3, one can selectively precipitate iron salts, which are common impurities in manganese dioxide. In the laboratory, manganese chloride can be prepared by treating manganese metal or manganese(II) carbonate with hydrochloric acid: Mn + 2 HCl + 4 H2O → MnCl2(H2O)4 + H2 MnCO3 + 2 HCl + 3 H2O → MnCl2(H2O)4 + CO2 Structures Anhydrous MnCl2 adopts a layered cadmium chloride-like structure. The tetrahydrate consists of octahedral cis-Mn(H2O)4Cl2 molecules. The trans isomer, which is metastable, is also known. The dihydrate MnCl2(H2O)2 is a coordination polymer. Each Mn center is coordinated to four doubly bridging chloride ligands. The octahedron is completed
