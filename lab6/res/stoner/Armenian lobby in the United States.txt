Armenian lobby in the United States
The Armenian American lobby is the diverse coalition of those who, as individuals and as groups, seek to influence the United States foreign policy in support of Armenia, Armenians or Armenian policies. One of its primary goals is for the United States to recognize the Armenian Genocide, but the Turkish and occasionally Israeli lobby have until recently, successfully lobbied against this. Organization The Armenian lobby is almost exclusively formed by domestic organizations such as the Armenian National Committee of America and the Armenian Assembly of America, leaving the Armenian Government largely out of the lobbying process. The two organizations have similar lobbying goals, mostly revolving around improving U.S. relations with Armenia in terms of aid, blocking aid to Turkey and Azerbaijan, as well as their ultimate goal of Armenian Genocide recognition. However, the two groups provide different approaches to promoting the Armenian cause. The ANCA focuses mostly on grassroots initiatives to mobilize a highly concentrated Armenian electorate. On the other hand, the AAA focuses on retaining large donations from influential Armenians in America. The AAA draws upon the AIPAC model, which is very much centered on influencing foreign policy. The competition between these two groups creates a "hyper-mobilization" of resources
