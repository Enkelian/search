Ascension of the Watchers
Ascension of The Watchers is a band that was started by Burton C. Bell (Fear Factory, G/Z/R) and John Bechdel (Ministry, Fear Factory, Killing Joke, Prong, Murder, Inc.). They wrote and recorded their first release, Iconoclast, at Bechdel's home in rural Pennsylvania. Iconoclast was originally released on 12" vinyl but has since been released on CD. In October 2005 they headlined The Surfacing Tour with Bechdel's other band, False Icons and Still Life Decay, a New York City industrial metal band that Burton has recorded with. A full-length album and some "special shows" are in the planning stages for 2007 according to an announcement Burton made on the Official Ascension of The Watchers website in October 2006. In July 2018, Burton announced that AOTW will be recording their second studio album "Stormcrow". Line-up Burton C.
