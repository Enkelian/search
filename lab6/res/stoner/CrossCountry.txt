It is one of only two franchised train operating companies that does not operate any stations, the other being Caledonian Sleeper. All services call at Birmingham New Street. History Formation In June 2006 the Department for Transport announced its intention to restructure a number of franchises. The changes created a 'New Cross Country' franchise that would incorporate the existing InterCity Cross Country franchise run by Virgin CrossCountry, without the West Coast Main Line services (with the Birmingham to Scotland services transferring to Virgin Trains West Coast and the Manchester to Scotland services transferring to First TransPennine Express). Some services from the Central Trains franchise were to be added. In October 2006 the Department for Transport issued the invitation to tender to the shortlisted bidders: Arriva, FirstGroup, National Express and Virgin Rail Group. On 10 July 2007
