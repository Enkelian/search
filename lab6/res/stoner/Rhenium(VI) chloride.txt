Rhenium(VI) chloride
Rhenium(VI) chloride is the inorganic compound with the formula ReCl6. It is a black paramagnetic solid. The molecules adopt an octahedral structure as seen in tungsten(VI) chloride. Preparation and reactions Rhenium(VI) chloride is prepared from the rhenium hexafluoride with excess boron trichloride: 2 ReF6 + 6 BCl3 → ReCl6 + 6 BF2ClIt is unstable at room temperature with respect to rhenium(V) chloride: 2 ReCl6 → [ReCl5]2 + Cl2 == References ==
