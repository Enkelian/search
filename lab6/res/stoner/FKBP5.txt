FKBP5
FK506 binding protein 5, also known as FKBP5, is a protein which in humans is encoded by the FKBP5 gene. Function The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the immunophilin protein family, which play a role in immunoregulation and basic cellular processes involving protein folding and trafficking. This encoded protein is a cis-trans prolyl isomerase that binds to the immunosuppressants FK506 and rapamycin. It is thought to mediate calcineurin inhibition. It also interacts functionally with mature corticoid receptor hetero-complexes (i.e. progesterone-, glucocorticoid-, mineralocorticoid-receptor complexes) along with the 90 kDa heat shock protein and P23 protein. Clinical significance The FKBP5 gene has been found to have multiple polyadenylation sites and is statistically associated with a higher rate of depressive disorders. Interactions FKBP5 has been shown to interact with Heat shock protein 90kDa alpha (cytosolic), member A1.
