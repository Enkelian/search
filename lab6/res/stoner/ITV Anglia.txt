Its principal programme nowadays is ITV News Anglia which is split into two regional editions, both airing at 6pm on weekdays. History Anglia Television launched on 27 October 1959 as an independent company serving the East of England, the eleventh ITA station to go on air. At launch, Anglia broadcast from the Mendlesham Transmitter. It was soon joined by Sandy Heath and then Belmont. Under the chairmanship of Aubrey Buxton the station soon established a reputation for producing excellent drama, through a deal with then-ITV London station Associated Rediffusion. Anglia also established the long-running nature documentary series Survival. During the early 1960s, Anglia looked toward the unserved portion of south-east England, which was to be served by a transmitter at Dover, as a logical extension to its eastern bailiwick â€“
