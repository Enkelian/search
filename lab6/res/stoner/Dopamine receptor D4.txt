Dopamine receptor D4
The dopamine receptor D4 is a dopamine D2-like G protein-coupled receptor encoded by the DRD4 gene on chromosome 11 at 11p15.5.The structure of DRD4 was recently reported in complex with the antipsychotic drug nemonapride.As with other dopamine receptor subtypes, the D4 receptor is activated by the neurotransmitter dopamine. It is linked to many neurological and psychiatric conditions including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, ADHD, addictive behaviors, Parkinson's disease, and eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa. A weak association has been drawn between DRD4 and borderline personality disorder. It is also a target for drugs which treat schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. The D4 receptor is considered to be D2-like in which the activated receptor inhibits the enzyme adenylate cyclase, thereby reducing the intracellular concentration of the second messenger cyclic AMP. Genetics The human protein is coded by the DRD4 on chromosome 11 located in 11p15.5.There are slight variations (mutations/polymorphisms) in the human gene: A 48-base pair VNTR in exon 3 C-521T in the promoter 13-base pair deletion of bases 235 to 247 in exon 1 12 base pair repeat in exon 1 Val194Gly A polymorphic tandem duplication of 48 bpMutations in this gene have been associated with various behavioral phenotypes, including autonomic
