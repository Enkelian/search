Grave (band)
Grave is a Swedish death metal band that was formed in 1986 by vocalist and guitarist Ola Lindgren, who is their only constant member. The band had particular success in the early 1990s, and their first four albums, Into the Grave, You'll Never See..., Soulless and Hating Life, cemented their reputation as one of Sweden's foremost death metal bands. Grave went on hiatus in 1997, but got back together two years later. Since then, they have released seven more albums, making a total of eleven studio albums. Along with Dismember, Entombed and Unleashed, Grave is considered one of the "big four" of Swedish death metal. Band history Early career (1986â€“1993) The band started in 1986 under the name Corpse and changed it to Grave in 1988. They recorded various demos from 1986 to 1991, and recorded some singles and EPs as well. Their debut full-length album Into the Grave was released in 1991. The release led to a European and American tour. In 1992, the band released their second album You'll Never See..., which was a continuation of the style featured on their debut. However, bassist Jonas Torndal left the band as a result of his increasing dislike for touring.
