Renee Marlin-Bennett
Renee Marlin-Bennett (born September 29, 1959), is a professor of Political Science at Johns Hopkins University. Her research on global problems probes power, information flows, borders, and bodies. The research draws upon approaches from international theory, pragmatism, international political sociology, and global political economy. Early in her career, her focus was on the evolution of rules that order global practices as well as those that provide the basis for disorder. She has examined substantive areas such as trade, intellectual property, information, and privacy to examine how contestation, rhetorical frames, and path dependence contribute to development of global orders. Her current research on global problems focuses on instances of power and how they can congeal into governance or disruption of governance, especially as Information Age technologies change who and what can be an actor in global politics. This stream of research includes analysis of politics online and of global sites within cyberspace as opportunities for complicating our understanding of the practices of global politics. She also researches this theme of power instances by exploring the relation between the embodied human and global practices, the politics of borders, and technologies and art in global affairs.
