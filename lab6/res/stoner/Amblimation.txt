Amblimation
Amblimation was a British animation studio and the animation production arm of Amblin Entertainment. It was founded by Steven Spielberg in 1989, after he parted ways with Don Bluth, due to creative differences. It only made three films: An American Tail: Fievel Goes West (1991), We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story (1993), and Balto (1995), all of which were distributed by Universal Pictures. The company's mascot, Fievel Mousekewitz, appears in its production logo. The studio was shut down in 1997 and became a self-storage facility called Access Self-Storage. Some of the Amblimation staff went on to join DreamWorks Animation, which was later acquired in 2016 by Universal's parent company NBCUniversal for $3.8 billion.
