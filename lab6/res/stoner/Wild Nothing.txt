Wild Nothing is an American indie rock/dream pop band from Blacksburg, Virginia, formed in late 2009 by Jack Tatum. During live performances, Tatum is joined by additional musicians, currently Nic Hessler (guitar), Jeff Haley (bass), Joshua Sushman (keyboards, saxophone) and Cameron Allen (drums). To date, Wild Nothing has released four studio albums, Gemini (2010), Nocturne (2012), Life of Pause (2016) and Indigo (2018), and three EPs, Golden Haze (2010), Empty Estate (2013) and Laughing Gas (2020). History Jack Tatum (whose full name is John Alexander Tatum) previously played in bands Jack and the Whale and FACEPAINT in the college town of Blacksburg. He began recording under the name Wild Nothing in the summer of 2009. Emerging at a time when a handful of C86-esque groups were in vogue, Tatum's demos garnered attention in indie music circles with a cover of Kate Bush's "Cloudbusting". Tatum signed with the Captured Tracks record label after the success of these demos, and began touring with Haley, Goodman and drummer Max Brooks. Wild Nothing's first single, "Summer Holiday," was released on Captured Tracks in 2009, followed by "Cloudbusting." The band's debut full-length, Gemini, was released in the spring of 2010. Gemini was ranked the 49th
