Cyberdelic
Cyberdelic (from "cyber-" and "psychedelic") was the fusion of cyberculture and the psychedelic subculture into a new counterculture of the 1980s and 1990s. Cyberdelic art was created by calculating fractal objects and representing the calculation results as still images, animations, music, or other media. Rave dance parties featured psychedelic trance music, with the accompaniment of laser light shows, projected images, and artificial fog. Attendees often used "club drugs". Advocates Timothy Leary, an advocate of psychedelic drug use who became a cult figure of the hippies in the 1960s, reemerged in the 1980s as a spokesperson of the cyberdelic counterculture, whose adherents called themselves "cyberpunks", and became one of the most philosophical promoters of personal computers (PC), the Internet, and immersive virtual reality. Leary proclaimed that the "PC is the LSD of the 1990s" and admonished bohemians to "turn on, boot up, jack in".In contrast to some of the hippies of the 1960s who were antiscience and antitechnology, the cyberpunks of the 1980s and 1990s ecstatically embraced technology and the hacker ethic. They believed that high technology (and smart drugs) could help human beings overcome limits, that it could liberate them from authority and even enable them to transcend space, time,
