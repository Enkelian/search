Archetype Tour was a concert tour headlined by American industrial metal band Fear Factory, in support of their 5th album, Archetype. The tour started on January 23, 2004 at the Big Day Out in Sydney, Australia, as a mystery band, and ended on February 25, 2005 at the Artafe Vega Rock in Spain. This was the first time they performed live since 2001.
