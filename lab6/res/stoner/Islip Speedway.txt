Islip Speedway
Islip Speedway was a .2-mile (320-meter) oval race track in Islip, New York which was open from 1947 until 1984. It is the smallest track ever to host NASCAR's Grand National Series, from 1964 to 1971. The first demolition derby took place at Islip Speedway in 1958. The idea was patented by Larry Mendelsohn, who worked at Islip Speedway. The speedway has since been demolished. Demolition Derby Islip Speedway is credited with hosting the first demolition derby, which took place in 1958. According to Larry Mendelsohn, he originated the idea after realizing that spectators enjoyed watching the cars crash more than the races. However, there are alternative accounts to the origins of demolition derby. One source claims that Don Basile invented the demolition derby at Carrell Speedway in 1947. The ABC television show Wide World of Sports broadcast demolition derbies at Islip Speedway beginning in the early 1960s. This exposure gave the event national attention and helped increase its popularity. Figure 8 In 1962 a Figure 8 track was added. The Figure 8 course shared the north and south turns with the oval and crisscrossed using lanes paved through the infield. The first Figure 8 race was held on August
