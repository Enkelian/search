Obi strip
An obi (帯) is a strip of paper looped around a book or other product. This extends the term obi used for Japanese clothing; it is written with the same kanji. It is also referred to as a tasuki (襷) (another kimono accessory), or more narrowly as obigami (帯紙, belt paper). For books Many books in Japan are supplied with an obi, which is normally added outside any dust jacket. However, a book in a slipcase may have an obi around the slipcase. In English, the term belly-band is sometimes used instead.
