Steam was an American pop-rock music group, best known for the 1969 number one single, "Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye". The song was written and recorded by studio musicians Gary DeCarlo, Dale Frashuer, and producer/writer Paul Leka at Mercury Records studios in New York City. The single was attributed to the band "Steam" although at the time there was actually no band with that name. Leka and the studio group recorded the first album. Band history Frashuer and DeCarlo were members of a vocal group called the Glenwoods from Bridgeport, Connecticut, for which Leka played the piano. The duo separated but kept in touch. Leka became a songwriter with Circle Five Productions and in 1967, he wrote and produced the Lemon Pipers' "Green Tambourine" and other Pipers songs with Shelley Pinz. In 1969, Leka was working at Mercury Records and he convinced the label's A&R to record DeCarlo (aka Garrett Scott). With Leka producing, DeCarlo recorded four singles, all of which Bob Reno, the label's head, thought would do well issued as an A-side. DeCarlo's first single was to be "Workin' On A Groovy Thing", but it was beaten by the the 5th Dimension version released a week
