The Amp
The Amp was a satellite and cable television channel, showing music videos, owned by British Sky Broadcasting, and operated on their behalf by Chart Show Channels. It was operated as part of a trio, with Scuzz and Flaunt as its sister stations. The Amp was a channel that aired more 'Alternative' or 'Non Mainstream' music along with a selection of trip hop, downtempo, electronica, ambient videos and programming from today and days gone by. Mainly old British 'indie' bands. It was an interactive channel in the early days but this was later dropped with the takeover and it was populated with specialist TV shows talking about the careers of famous 'Alternative' Rock bands. While playing music videos back to back during the day. It was dropped and replaced by a classic pop channel Bliss in March 2006 because although the channel had a loyal fan base, it simply failed to reach out to a wide enough audience and wasn't cost effective. Until November 15th 2018, the only original channel that still existed was Scuzz which was also owned by BSkyB, as Flaunt closed on 17 March 2010, while Bliss closed on 27 November 2015.
