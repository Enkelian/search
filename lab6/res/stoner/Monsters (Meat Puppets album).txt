As an added bonus, the reissue includes an "Enhanced CD" partition for play on home computers. Monsters offers the promotional video for "Light". The clip was produced and directed by Bill Taylor and features shots of the Puppets live in concert. Content Musical style Monsters was described as a "heavy rock attack" by Stephen Thomas Erlewine in an AllMusic biography of the band, while Roaul Hernandez of Austin Chronicle remarked that the record was "metal all the way". Reception AllMusic's Greg Prato gave a mixed review of Monsters, commenting that while songs were "hindered" by "synth textures" and individual instrument recording, the record had "several highlights" including a "viscious" album opener in "Attacked By Monsters", and the "tough rocker" "The Void".
