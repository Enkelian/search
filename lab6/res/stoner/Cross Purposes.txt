Cross Purposes
Cross Purposes is the seventeenth studio album by English rock band Black Sabbath, released in January 1994. Album information Dehumanizer saw the reunion of Mob Rules-era Black Sabbath, but, after the tour, Ronnie James Dio (vocals) and Vinny Appice (drums) departed. They were replaced by former Sabbath vocalist Tony Martin and former Rainbow drummer Bobby Rondinelli. Geezer Butler remained with the group, although he would depart later in the year again before the recording of the Forbidden album. Rondinelli left the recording sessions for Quiet Riot's album "Terrified" to join Black Sabbath. The song "Cardinal Sin" was originally intended to be titled "Sin Cardinal Sin" (or "Sin, Cardinal Sin") but a printing error on the album sleeve caused the first word to be removed. Sabbath simply adopted the title "Cardinal Sin" as the name of the song. A promo video in black-and-white was shot for the song "Hand That Rocks the Cradle". Tony Martin explains in an interview with Martin Popoff that he wrote this song about Beverly Allitt, a children's hospital nurse in England that was convicted of serial infanticide in 1993. The video features a young girl, assumably in reference to this. "What's the Use?" was released only
