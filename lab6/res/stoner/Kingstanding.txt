Kingstanding houses a covered drinking water reservoir, Perry Barr Reservoir, on the site of the former Perry Barr Farm. Kingstanding is served by two libraries; Kingstanding Library and Perry Common Library. The area known as Kingstanding Circle is the where the Kingstanding village centre lies with its shops and Kings Road/ Kingstanding Road roundabout. History The name of the area is derived from the occasion when the Stuart King Charles I supposedly reviewed his troops standing on the Neolithic Bowl Barrow in the area on 18 October 1642 during the English Civil War, after his stay at nearby Aston Hall. The first references to Kingstanding were as King's Standing. The course of the Icknield Street Roman Road runs past this barrow; and when the foundations for the water pumping station were being dug in 1884, a hoard of Roman coins was discovered. The area was largely rural until the 1928, when large-scale residential development commenced in the area.
