2007–08 Superleague Greece
The 2007–08 Superleague Greece was the second season since it establishment, and began on 1 September 2007. The defending champions were Olympiacos. Asteras Tripoli, Veria and Levadiakos were promoted from Beta Ethniki in the previous season. Postponement On 25 August, the Superleague and the Hellenic Football Federation decided to postpone the opening fixtures scheduled for that weekend (25 and 26 August) due to the ongoing fire disaster in the south of Greece (especially in the Peloponnese and Euboea). The championship started on 1 September 2007. Matchday 2 was carried out on the weekend of 21–22 September due to UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying matches (8 September) and Greek legislative election (16 September). On 20 February 2008 UEFA president Michel Platini presented the Hellenic Football Federation with a CHF 1 million cheque to help finance the rebuilding of football facilities damaged by the fires in Greece that summer.
