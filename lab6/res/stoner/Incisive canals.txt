Incisive canals
In the opening of the incisive foramen, the orifices of two lateral canals are visible; they are named the incisive canals or foramina of Stensen. Through each of them ascends the terminal branch of the greater palatine artery while the nasopalatine nerve descends, to anastomose with the posterior septal branch of sphenopalatine artery and the greater palatine nerve respectively.
