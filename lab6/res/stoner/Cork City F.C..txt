Cork City F.C.
Cork City Football Club (Irish: Cumann Peile Chathair Chorca√≠) is an Irish association football club based in Cork. The club currently plays in the League of Ireland Premier Division. The club was founded and elected to the League of Ireland in 1984. It was one of the first clubs in Ireland (and the first in Cork) to field a team of professional footballers. With the progression of professionalism at the club, continued development of the Turners Cross stadium and the transition to summer football, the club became one of the biggest and best supported clubs in the country. In 2008, financial issues resulted in a period of examinership, and the club's then holding company was wound up in 2010. A team was entered into the 2010 League of Ireland First Division, before the club re-acquired rights to the name "Cork City Football Club", and was promoted back to the premier division for the 2012 season. Cork City FC won its third premier division title, and first FAI Cup double, during the 2017 season. City's traditional colours are green and white with red trim, and the crest is a variant of the Cork coat of arms. The club play home games
