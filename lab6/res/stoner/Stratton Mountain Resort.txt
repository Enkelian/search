Stratton Mountain Resort
Stratton Mountain Resort is a ski area in the northeastern United States, located on Stratton Mountain in Stratton, Vermont, east of Manchester.

A big expansion took place for the 1964–65 season when the Snow Bowl was opened, bringing a double chairlift and over thirty acres (12 ha) of terrain. Another double chairlift was opened and the base lodge was expanded for the 1966–67 season, giving way to the birth of European style après-ski entertainment by the Innsbruck Trio, a group of Austrian ski instructors. The group became known as the Stratton Mountain Boys and a key marketing component of the mountain.In the early 1970s, following development of the initial terrain, Stratton began to develop a new beginner area; this opened in 1972 with additional trails, though plans for a new lift were not realized.
