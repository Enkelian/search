AnandTech
AnandTech is an online computer hardware magazine owned by Future plc. It was founded in 1997 by then-14-year-old Anand Lal Shimpi, who served as CEO and editor-in-chief until August 30, 2014, with Ryan Smith replacing him as editor-in-chief. The web site is a source of hardware reviews for off-the-shelf components and exhaustive benchmarking, targeted towards computer building enthusiasts, but later expanded to cover mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Its investigative articles have been cited by other technology news sites like PC Magazine and The Inquirer.Some of their articles on mass-market products such as mobile phones are syndicated by CNNMoney. The large accompanying forum is recommended by some books for bargain hunting in the technology field. AnandTech was acquired by Purch on 17 December 2014. Purch was acquired by Future in 2018. History In its early stages, Matthew Witheiler served as co-owner and Senior Hardware Editor, creating insightful and in-depth reviews for the site. In 2004 AnandTech added a feature to search for computer prices via a price engine developed in house by the senior editor as a graduate project in data mining. This price engine is called RTPE. In 2006 an AnandTech editor launched a spin-off called DailyTech,
