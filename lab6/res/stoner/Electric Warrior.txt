Electric Warrior
Electric Warrior is the second studio album by English rock band T. Rex, their sixth if including the group's earlier incarnation as Tyrannosaurus Rex. The album marked a turning point in the band's sound, dispensing with the folk-oriented music of the group's previous albums and pioneering a flamboyant, pop-friendly take on electric rock and roll known as glam rock.The album reached number 1 on the UK charts and became the best selling album of 1971. The single "Get it On" reached the top ten in the US Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. Retitled "Bang A Gong (Get It On)" by the US record company, it also became the band's only hit in North America. Electric Warrior has since received acclaim as a pivotal release of the glam rock movement. Promotion Marc Bolan, in a 1971 interview contained on the Rhino Records reissue, said of the album "I think Electric Warrior, for me, is the first album which is a statement of 1971 for us in England. I mean that's... If anyone ever wanted to know why we were big in the other part of the world, that album says it, for me."Bolan was a guest on the BBC Television show,
