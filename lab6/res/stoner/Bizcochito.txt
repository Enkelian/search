Bizcochito
Biscochitos or bizcochitos are a crisp lard- or butter-based cookie, flavored with cinnamon and anise. The name is a Spanish diminutive form of bizcocho. The dough is rolled and traditionally cut into the shape of stars and crescent moons. The cookie was developed by residents of New Mexico over the centuries from the first Spanish colonists of what was then known as Santa Fe de Nuevo MÃ©xico. The recipe for making the cookie has been greatly influenced not only by local and indigenous customs but also by recipes brought to New Mexico by immigrants from other Hispanic countries. Biscochitos are served during special celebrations, such as wedding receptions, baptisms, and religious holidays (especially during the Christmas season). It is commonly served along with hot chocolate. The cookie is seldom known outside the boundaries of the original Spanish province, although Spanish speakers may recognize the association with bizcocho, from the name, and may have some idea of what they must be, even if they have not encountered them before. State cookie In 1989, the U.S. State of New Mexico made the biscochito its official state cookie. This act made New Mexico the first U.S. state to have an official state cookie.
