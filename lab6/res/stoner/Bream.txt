Bream
Bream ( (listen) ) is a species of freshwater and marine fish belonging to a variety of genera including Abramis (e.g., A. brama, the common bream), Acanthopagrus, Argyrops, Blicca, Brama, Chilotilapia, Etelis, Lepomis, Gymnocranius, Lethrinus, Nemipterus, Pharyngochromis, Rhabdosargus, Scolopsis, or Serranochromis. Although species from all of these genera are called "bream", the term does not imply a degree of relatedness between them. Fish termed "bream" tend to be narrow, deep-bodied species. The name is a derivation of the Middle English word breme, of Old French origin. The term sea bream is sometimes used for Gilt-head bream (Sparus Aurata), (Orata in Italy and Spain) or porgies (both family Sparidae) or pomfrets (family Bramidae) .
