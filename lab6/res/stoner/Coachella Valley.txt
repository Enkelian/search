Coachella Valley
The Coachella Valley ( KOH-ə-CHEL-ə, koh-CHEL-ə) is an arid rift valley in the Colorado Desert of Southern California’s Riverside County. The valley extends approximately 45 mi (72 km) southeast from the San Gorgonio Pass to the northern shore of the Salton Sea, and is approximately 15 mi (24 km) wide along most of its length. It is bounded on the northeast by the San Bernardino and Little San Bernardino Mountains, and on the southwest by the San Jacinto and Santa Rosa Mountains. The Valley is best known as the location of several wintertime resort cities, especially Palm Springs, that are popular destinations for snowbirds—people who live in cold climates and seek out warmer weather during the winter. The valley is also known for a number of annual events, including the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, the Stagecoach Country Music Festival, and the Riverside County Fair and National Date Festival, all held in Indio. Other events include the Palm Springs Modernism Week, Palm Springs International Film Festival, the ANA Inspiration (Dinah Shore) women’s golf tournament, and the Indian Wells Masters tennis tournament. In addition to Palm Springs and Indio, the valley is home to the resort cities of Cathedral City,
