The video depicts Soundgarden as a motorcycle gang who rides Segways. Midway through the video, the band is shown shutting off an electronic music DJ's laptop, then taking over the stage and playing a show. The DJ proceeds to call the cops, and then the band flees the stage and rides again on the Segways with police in pursuit, ending with the band being arrested. One of the police officers who was arresting the band was played by electronic music artist Deadmau5. Rolling Stone referred to Soundgarden in the video as "badass." Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron said he felt it was "refreshing" that Dave Grohl decided to make a humorous video for "By Crooked Steps" when it is such a serious song. Cameron went on to say that this was a new experience since Soundgarden had only made "more traditional rock music videos"
