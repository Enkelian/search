Rhodium(III) chloride
Rhodium(III) chloride refers to inorganic compounds with the formula RhCl3(H2O)n, where n varies from 0 to 3. These are diamagnetic solids featuring octahedral Rh(III) centres. Depending on the value of n, the material is either a dense brown solid or a soluble reddish salt. The soluble trihydrated (n = 3) salt is widely used to prepare compounds used in homogeneous catalysis, notably for the industrial production of acetic acid and hydroformylation. Structures Aqueous solutions of RhCl3(H2O)3 have been characterized by 103Rh NMR spectroscopy, which shows the presence of several species. The proportions of which change with time and depend on the concentration of chloride. The relative distribution of these species determines the colour of the solutions, which can range from yellow (the hexaaquo ion) to "raspberry-red". Some of these species are [Rh(H2O)6]3+, [RhCl(H2O)5]2+, cis- and trans-[RhCl2(H2O)4]+, and [RhCl3(H2O)3]. Individual ions have been separated by ion exchange chromatography.Anhydrous rhodium chloride crystallises in the YCl3 and AlCl3 motif (see image in upper right). The metal centres are octahedral, and the halides are doubly bridging. It is a dense brown solid that is insoluble in common solvents and of little value in the laboratory. Preparation RhCl3(H2O)3 is produced from salts such as Na3RhCl6,
