Construction of the new sign started in March, and the new sign was finished and premiered on August 8, 2017. Guinness World Records has awarded the sign the title of the "first 3D robotic billboard". History & Design Early Signs (1920-2003) The first Coke Times Square debuted in 1920 at 49th and Broadway, with neon lighting being added in 1923. It flashed the words "Drink Coca-Cola, Delicious and Refreshing" and was the world's second-largest electric billboard at the time. This sign was replaced in 1932 with a new sign on 47th Street which highlighted a soda jerk, and was replaced again in the 1960s with a simpler sign that read, "The Pause That Refreshes." By the mid 1960s, the slogan "Things Go Better With Coke" was the latest slogan on the sign.
