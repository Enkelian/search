Spanish transition to democracy
The Spanish transition to democracy (Spanish: Transición española a la democracia, IPA: [tɾansiˈθjon espaˈɲola a la ðemoˈkɾaθja]), known in Spain as the Transition (Spanish: La Transición, IPA: [la tɾansiˈθjon]) or the Spanish transition (Spanish: Transición española, IPA: [tɾansiˈθjon espaˈɲola]), is a period of modern Spanish history that started on 20 November 1975, the date of death of Francisco Franco, who had established a dictatorship after the victory of the Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War. However, historians disagree on the exact date the transition was completed: some say it ended after the 1977 general election, while others place it later, when the 1978 Constitution was approved. Others suggest it ended with the failure of the 1981 attempted coup d'état. At its latest, the Transition is said to have ended with the first peaceful transfer of executive power, after the victory of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) in the 1982 general election. Political role of Juan Carlos I Francisco Franco came to power in 1939, following the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), and ruled as a dictator until his death in 1975. In 1969, he designated Prince Juan Carlos, grandson of Spain's most recent king, Alfonso XIII, as his official successor.
