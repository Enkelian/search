Since then I have done a bit of session work, including a tour with Adam Faith and drifted through a number of rock bands until someone who heard me do a gig with a band called Monksilver mentioned me to Steve Harley. We soon discovered we could communicate on the same level, and having joined the band, I quickly realised that I had found my niche in rock music."With Steve Harley and Cockney Rebel, Elliott enjoyed three top 10 albums including the number 1 single "Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me)" and other 4 top 10 singles.
