The term Underground music can be taken to denote those practices perceived as outside, or somehow opposed to, mainstream popular music culture. Underground music is intimately tied to popular music culture as a whole, so there are important tensions within underground music because it appears to both assimilate and resist the forms and processes of popular music culture.

Notions of individuality non-conformity are also commonly deployed in extolling the virtue of underground music.

However most underground music is readily accessible, although performances and recordings may be difficult for the uninitiated to find.
