Molarity
Molar concentration (also called molarity, amount concentration or substance concentration) is a measure of the concentration of a chemical species, in particular of a solute in a solution, in terms of amount of substance per unit volume of solution. In chemistry, the most commonly used unit for molarity is the number of moles per litre, having the unit symbol mol/L or mol⋅dm-3 in SI unit. A solution with a concentration of 1 mol/L is said to be 1 molar, commonly designated as 1 M. To avoid confusion with SI prefix Mega which has the same abbreviation, small caps ᴍ or italicized M are also used in journals and textbooks. Definition Molar concentration or molarity is most commonly expressed in units of moles of solute per litre of solution. For use in broader applications, it is defined as amount of substance of solute per unit volume of solution, or per unit volume available to the species, represented by lowercase c: c = n V = N N A V = C N A . {\displaystyle c={\frac {n}{V}}={\frac {N}{N_{\rm {A}}\,V}}={\frac {C}{N_{\rm {A}}}}.} Here, n is the amount of the solute in moles, N is the number of constituent particles present in volume
