Private Secretary
A personal secretary (PS) is a civil servant in a governmental department or ministry, responsible to a secretary of state or minister. A personal secretary is normally of middle management level; however, as the key official responsible for disseminating the decision of ministers and indeed as their gatekeeper, his or her role is of considerably greater significance than this grade or level suggests. Depending on what level of politician the official works for they will be assisted by one or more assistants and or deputy secretaries, or even head a whole office in which those may be section chiefs.
