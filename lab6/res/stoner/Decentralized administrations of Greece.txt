Decentralized administrations of Greece
The decentralized administrations (Greek: αποκεντρωμένες διοικήσεις, apokentroménes dioikíseis) are the third level of administrative divisions in Greece. They were created in January 2011 as part of a far-reaching reform of the country's administrative structure, the Kallikratis reform (Law 3852/2010).They enjoy both administrative and financial autonomy and exercise devolved state powers in urban planning, environmental and energy policy, forestry, migration and citizenship. Beyond that, they are tasked with supervising the first and second-level self-governing bodies: the municipalities and regions. They are run by a government-appointed general secretary, assisted by an advisory council drawn from the regional governors and the representatives of the municipalities.
