Rochester Lancers (1967–80)
The Rochester Lancers were a soccer team based in Rochester, New York that played in the American Soccer League from 1967 until 1969 and the North American Soccer League from 1970 to 1980 at Aquinas Stadium (renamed Holleder Memorial Stadium in 1974). They were owned by Charlie Schiano (majority stake), Pat DiNolfo, Nuri Sabuncu and Tony Pullano. History After three years competing in the ASL, the club jumped to the newer NASL and won the league championship in their first season. They followed that up with a division title the next season and a second consecutive MVP award for forward Carlos Metidieri. During the 1971 NASL playoffs, the Lancers won the longest game in NASL history, 2–1. Game 1 of the best-of-three semifinal against the Dallas Tornado was mercifully ended by league scoring champion Metidieri late in the 6th overtime period, in the 176th minute, less than four minutes shy of playing two complete games in one day! A week later Rochester lost the deciding Game 3 in the 148th minute of a 4 OT battle.They were the only NASL club in history to participate in an international tournament, in the 1971 CONCACAF Champions' Cup where they finished in fourth-place.
