Steel crisis
The steel crisis was a recession in the global steel market during the 1973–75 recession and early 1980s recession following the post–World War II economic expansion and the 1973 oil crisis, further compounded by the 1979 oil crisis, and lasted well into the 1980s. Steel prices dropped significantly as the market became saturated with steel from previous demand, and many steel mills in the Western world were driven out of business. Some areas affected by the steel crisis were the Rust belt in North America, the English Midlands in the United Kingdom, the Ruhr area in West Germany and Bergslagen in Sweden. United States Steel production in the United States peaked at 111.4 million tons in 1973, and declined slightly to 97.9 million tons in 1978. By 1984, steel production collapsed to just 70 million tons. The next peak was not reached until 2000, when 100 million tons was produced, before falling to just 86 million tons in 2014. Imports played a role in this decline: from just 146,000 tons in 1946, steel imports reached 24 million tons in 1978 (for comparison, the U.S. imported 34.5 million tons in 2017); the U.S. became a net importer of steel in 1959.
