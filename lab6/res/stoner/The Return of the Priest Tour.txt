The Return of the Priest Tour
The Return of the Priest Tour was a 1971 concert tour by British heavy metal band Judas Priest running from 6 March 1971 until 28 December 1971 throughout England and a couple of dates in Wales. This tour consisted of a differently formed Judas Priest. It featured founding members Al Atkins (vocals), K.K. Downing (guitar) and Ian Hill (bass) along with John Ellis (drums). Alan Moore replaced John Ellis on drums around October 1971. December 1971 Chris "Congo" Campbell replaced Alan Moore on drums. Atkins asked to join the band, in which they accepted his offer, and also suggested to use the Judas Priest name from the original group he fronted, which disbanded in April 1970.
