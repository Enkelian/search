Pinkerton's Assorted Colours
Pinkerton's Assorted Colours were a mid-1960s pop band from England. They are best known for their 1965 hit, "Mirror, Mirror", which reached No. 9 in the UK Singles Chart. Career Formed in Rugby, Warwickshire as 'The Liberators', they became Pinkerton's Assorted Colours in 1965, and scored a Top 10 hit with their first single release, "Mirror, Mirror" written and sung by bandmember Tony Newman. They were managed by Reginald Calvert, and supported by his then radio station, Radio City. Lack of further chart success found them dubbed one-hit wonders. Stuart Colman, Pinkertonâ€™s one time bassist, went on to become a BBC Radio One DJ, and later a producer for Shakin' Stevens, Cliff Richard and Billy Fury. After their second single they shortened their name to 'Pinkerton's Colours', then to 'Pinkertons.' In 1969, following several lineup changes, they reformed as The Flying Machine, who also became one-hit wonders, albeit in the United States.Band member Barrie Bernard later played in Jigsaw. Drummer David Holland left the band in 1968 to form Trapeze, and later became successful as the drummer for Judas Priest.
