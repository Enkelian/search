Live (UFO album)
Live is a live album by the band UFO. It was the group's first live recording and was initially released exclusively in Japan in December 1971 entitled U.F.O Landed Japan. The album was later released abroad in 1972 onward with different titles, such as UFO Live in Japan and UFO Lands in Tokyo. It features the original lineup of the band with Mick Bolton on guitar, and consists of blues covers and songs from their first two space-rock albums. All of the tracks are in a jam-oriented style which is very different from the aggressive, song-oriented style they would be later known for. It was the last album to feature Mick Bolton on guitar, he would be replaced with Michael Schenker. The album was reissued on the Flying, The Early Years compilation, along with all of the band's other pre-Schenker work.
