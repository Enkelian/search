Order of Australia
The Order of Australia is an order of chivalry established on 14 February 1975 by Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia, to recognise Australian citizens and other persons for achievement or meritorious service. Before the establishment of the order, Australian citizens received British honours. The Queen of Australia is sovereign head of the order, while the Governor-General of Australia is the principal companion/dame/knight (as relevant at the time) and chancellor of the order. The governor-general's official secretary, currently Paul Singer, is secretary of the order. Levels of membership The order is divided into a general and a military division. The five levels of appointment to the order in descending order of seniority have been: Knight and Dame of the Order of Australia (AK and AD – inactive); Companion of the Order of Australia (AC – quota of 35 per annum); Officer of the Order of Australia (AO – quota of 140 per annum); Member of the Order of Australia (AM – quota of 365 per annum); and Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM – no quota).Honorary awards at all levels may be made to deserving non-citizens – these awards are made additional to the quotas.
