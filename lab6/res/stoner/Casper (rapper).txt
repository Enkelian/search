Casper (rapper)
Benjamin Griffey (born 25 September 1982), better known by his stage name Casper, is a German American rapper signed to the German music label Sony Music. Biography Casper was born in Lemgo in North Rhine-Westphalia to a German mother and an American father, Arlen Griffey, who was a soldier stationed in Lemgo. His family moved to Augusta, Georgia, in the United States, when he was two weeks old, where he lived in a trailer park. At the age of 11, he moved back to Germany and settled in Bielefeld with his mother and younger sister. Despite his mother being German, he had not been raised bilingually and therefore struggled at school initially. Career Casper was involved in many studio recordings with other German rappers, such as Abroo and Separate. Together they founded the hip-hop group Kinder des Zorns. In 2004 they released Rap Art War, their first and only album. In 2006 he released a mixtape called Die Welt Hört Mich with the label 667 - One More Than The Devil.
