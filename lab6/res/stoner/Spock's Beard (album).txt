Spock's Beard (album)
Spock's Beard is the eponymous ninth studio album by American progressive rock band Spock's Beard. On September 21, 2006, Dave Meros added the tentative track list to the band's website, and said the following regarding the album's title: "As you probably know by now, we're calling our ninth studio release simply Spock's Beard. No big heavy reasoning behind that, really, it just seemed like a cool thing to do. (Of course, you are more than welcome to help us invent some heavy philosophical or hidden meaning so we'll have something interesting to say in interviews...There are a few cool song titles that could have become the CD title...but we've done that a lot before. Then there is the obvious 'SB9' and its variations, or the clever play on words thing, like 'nein' or 'asinine' or something like that."Like its predecessors "A Guy Named Sid" (from Feel Euphoria) and "A Flash Before My Eyes" (from Octane), the individual sections of "As Far as the Mind Can See" are divided into separate tracks on the album.
