Battle Cry is a live video released by Judas Priest on 25 March 2016 on DVD and on 1 April 2016 on Blu-ray. It was filmed at the Wacken Open Air festival on 1 August 2015 in front of a capacity of 85,000 people. A CD version was also released bundled with the DVD version as well. Both DVD and Blu-ray formats contain three bonus tracks recorded from their 10 December 2015 show at the Ergo Arena in Gdansk, Poland. Reception Chad Bowar of Loudwire stated "Priest have released a plethora of live albums over the years, and Battle Cry is a worthy addition to that canon. It effectively captures this era of the band, who have aged extremely gracefully and show no signs of slowing down any time soon."
