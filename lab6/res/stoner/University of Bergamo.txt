University of Bergamo
The University of Bergamo (Italian: Università degli Studi di Bergamo), known colloquially as UniBg, is an Italian public university located in Bergamo, Italy. It was founded on 11 December 1968 and is organized in six departments. History The University of Bergamo, founded in 1968, was originally named "The Institute of Foreign Languages and Literature". Under Rector Serio Galeotti (1972–75), the degree course in Economics and business was introduced (1974), finally becoming a Faculty in 1988. During the Chancellorship of Giorgio Szëgo, characterized by the new Faculty of Economics, the University continued to expand, but it was the Rector Pietro Enrico Ferri in 1990 who introduced the Faculty of Engineering in Dalmine and accompanied the passing of the private Institute to the State under the new name of "Università degli Studi di Bergamo". Over the years the University has played an important role in recuperating some of the historic buildings in the Upper City: the Faculty of Foreign Languages started off in the ex-palace of the Venetian Governor in Piazza Vecchia; Economics was in the ex-Capuchin monastery in Piazza Rosate, while the Rector's seat is still in the ex-Terzi Palace of St. Agatha in Via Salvecchio. The University has steadily expanded
