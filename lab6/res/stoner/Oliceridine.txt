Oliceridine
Oliceridine (developmental code name TRV-130; tentative brand name Olinvo) is an opioid drug that is under evaluation in human clinical trials for the intravenous treatment of severe acute pain. It is a μ-opioid receptor biased agonist developed by Trevena. In cell-based (in vitro) research, oliceridine elicits robust G protein signaling, with potency and efficacy similar to that of morphine, but with less β-arrestin 2 recruitment and receptor internalization—thus, it may have fewer adverse effects than morphine. In general, in vitro potency does not guarantee any clinical relevance in humans. Society and culture An FDA advisory committee voted against the approval of oliceridine in 2018, due to concerns that the benefit of the drug did not exceed the risk. The risks of oliceridine include prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG, and depression of the respiratory drive (which could cause a person to stop breathing). As a result of the committee's vote, the FDA declined to approve oliceridine, citing safety concerns.
