Sounds of the Underground
The Sounds of the Underground tour was a festival-like tour that rivaled Ozzfest in its first year of existence. It was held annually for three years (2005, 2006, and 2007). The tour features extreme metal and metalcore, and hardcore bands. The existence of this tour, which was held in national arenas, was to attract the rising interest of metal, hardcore, and metalcore bands in the mainstream. In December 2007, it was announced that the tour would no longer be held as it could not compete with Ozzfest and Mayhem festival scheduled to start sometime in the summer of 2008. Sounds of the Underground was initially a radio show in Kitchener, Canada on 88.3 CJIQ that got taken off the air for indecent remarks, but is now back on air on a different channel 93.3 CFRU, hosted by James Hammond. Sounds of the Underground was later taken off air from 93.3 CFRU as well for indecent remarks. 2005 line-up Lamb of God Clutch Poison the Well Opeth From Autumn to Ashes (dropped off tour in July because of musical differences) Unearth Chimaira Norma Jean Every Time I Die Throwdown Gwar Strapping Young Lad High on Fire All That Remains Madball (started
