Swayne Field
Swayne Field was a minor league baseball park in Toledo, Ohio. It was the home of the Toledo Mud Hens from July 3, 1909, until the club disbanded after the 1955 season. It was also home to a short-lived entry in the South-Michigan League in 1914. The park was named for Noah H. Swayne, Jr., the son of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Noah Haynes Swayne, who donated the land for the ballpark. The double-decker ballpark replaced Armory Park. The main stand was built of steel and concrete, one of the first minor league ballparks not made primarily of wood. The ballpark was located on a block bounded by Monroe Street (southwest, first base), Detroit Avenue (southeast, right field), Council Street (northeast, left field) and railroad tracks (northwest, third base). Ground was broken on March 6, 1909, and the park opened on July 3. The opening game crowd got its money's worth, as the game went 18 innings, Columbus edging out Toledo 12-11. (Toledo Baseball Guide, p. 97) Field dimensions initially were 360 feet (110 m) down the left field line, 482 feet (147 m) to center field, and 327 to right field. The park initially held 11,800 spectators. 1928 expansion
