Larry the Lobster
Larry The Lobster was the subject of an April 10, 1982 comedy sketch by Eddie Murphy on Saturday Night Live. Background In an early example of interactive television, Murphy held Larry, a live lobster, aloft and declared that the show's audience would determine whether he lived or died. Murphy then read two "900" phone numbers, one for those who wanted to spare Larry, and another for those who wanted to see him cooked. Calls cost $0.50 each. Murphy tended to read the number to save Larry very quickly, as opposed to his giving the number to cook Larry very slowly and clearly. Updates on the voting were given by other cast members over the course of the episode, and in the span of 30 minutes, viewers made nearly 500,000 calls, sending phone traffic soaring.The heavy phone use stood as a record or near-record for many years. The spike in traffic perplexed AT&T employees, who eventually figured out that the program was responsible.Though the phone network survived the spike, it was sufficiently threatening to operations that AT&T established communication with the television networks so that they could be warned of potentially disruptive future events; this system remains in use to this
