The video was shot in New York City and portrayed Sonic Youth performing in the midst of a fashion show that showcased "grunge" clothing. The clothing, in fact, was one of the collections ("Grunge Collection") done by Marc Jacobs for Perry Ellis in 1992. Jacobs was a close friend of bassist Kim Gordon and the band. The video also marked the first film appearance of ChloÃ« Sevigny. Singles chart References Sonic Youth - Discography - Sugar Kane External links Lyrics of this song at MetroLyrics
