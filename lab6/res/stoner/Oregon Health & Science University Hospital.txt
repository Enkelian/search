Oregon Health & Science University Hospital (OHSU Hospital) is a 522 bed teaching hospital, biomedical research facility, and Level I trauma center located on the campus of Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) in Portland in the U.S. state of Oregon. OHSU hospital has consistently been ranked by the U.S. News & World Report as the #1 hospital in the Portland metro regional area and is frequently ranked nationally in multiple medical specialties. Located on OHSU's Marquam Hill campus south of Downtown Portland, the hospital is adjacent to Doernbecher Children's Hospital and a Shriners Hospital for Children. OHSU Hospital is one of only two Level I trauma centers in Oregon. History The hospital was the subject of a lawsuit in 2006 due to a surgery performed on former television personality Ken Ackerman. The jury awarded Ackerman $1.4 million in the medical malpractice suit in a case that then spent years on appeal in the courts and saw a change in the Oregon Tort Claims Act while the case continued. In October 2008, the hospital decided to postpone a $350 million expansion of its Kohler Pavilion wing. The hospital did open 60 additional beds in the Kohler wing in February 2009,
