Foramen lacerum
The foramen lacerum (Latin: lacerated piercing) is a triangular hole in the base of skull, located between the sphenoid, the apex of the petrous temporal and the basilar part of the occipital. Structure The foramen lacerum (Latin: lacerated piercing) is a triangular hole in the base of skull located between the sphenoid, apex of petrous temporal and basilar part of occipital. It is the juncture of the petroclival, sphenopetrosal, and pterygosphenoidal sutures. The foramen lacerum is a foramen situated anteromedial to the carotid canal. Development The foramen lacerum fills with cartilage after birth. Variation Function The artery of pterygoid canal, the nerve of pterygoid canal and some venous drainage pass through the foramen lacerum. In the foramen lacerum the greater petrosal nerve joins with the deep petrosal nerve to form the nerve of the pterygoid canal. The deep petrosal nerve carries sympathetic and the greater petrosal nerve carries parasympathetic fibers of the autonomic nervous system to blood vessels, mucous membranes, salivary glands, and lacrimal glands. Furthermore, one of the terminal branches of the ascending pharyngeal artery (itself a branch of the external carotid artery) passes through the foramen lacerum. The ascending pharyngeal artery is one of three possible "meningeal branches"
