Who's Real
"Who's Real" is a song by American hip hop recording artist Jadakiss, released June 16, 2009 as the fourth single from his third studio album The Last Kiss. The song features guest appearances from fellow American rappers OJ Da Juiceman and Swizz Beatz, the latter of whom produced the track. The single was officially released on June 16, 2009. Background The original version had a longer second verse: after Juiceman's lines follow the lines by Jusmula (beginning with "It's real funny when a nigga play a C.L.,/ O.S.E., I be trippin' like G.L." and so on). It also contained the word "bastards" in Jada's line "Couple of flips and then stash it, bastards", which got blocked out in the final version, so it would be totally without profanities. Music video A music video was directed by Taj and shot on May 13, 2009. There are cameo appearances from Ja Rule, Clipse, Clyde Carson, DJ Webstar, Grafh, and Styles P. There are also various Ruff Ryders Lifestyles members with their motorbikes featured in the video. The music video was released as the New Joint of the Day on 106 & Park on June 10, 2009.
