United Kingdom Independent Broadcasting
United Kingdom Independent Broadcasting (UKIB) is an affiliation of three British independent television production companies and broadcasters. The primary function of its predecessor (ITCA, the Independent Television Companies Association) was to represent independent British television interests as a member of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). The members of UKIB are the ITV Network Centre, the 17 ITV Companies, Channel 4, and S4C. History United Kingdom Independent Broadcasting (UKIB) was formed in 1981, when the Association of Independent Radio Contractors (AIRC) was admitted as an active member of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). It replaced Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA, formerly Independent Television Authority or ITA) as the second British EBU member. Once ITCA was admitted as a fully active EBU member, the AIRC joined with ITA to form the Commercial Radio Companies Association (CRCA) in 1996. CRCA cancelled its EBU membership by the end of 2002. The IBA continued to exist until it was disbanded by the Broadcasting Act 1990, which replaced it with the Independent Television Commission (ITC) and the Radio Authority. Members Digital channels Besides the main ITV, Channel 4, and S4C channels, there are several digital-only channels (ITV2, ITV3, ITV4, and CITV) owned by ITV plc and E4,
