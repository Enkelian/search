Buddhist Churches of America
The Buddhist Churches of America (abbreviated as BCA in English, 米国仏教団 or Beikoku Bukkyōdan in Japanese) is the United States branch of the Nishi Honganji subsect of Jōdo Shinshū ("True Pure Land School") Buddhism. Jōdo Shinshū is also popularly known as "Shin Buddhism". The BCA is one of several overseas kyōdan ("districts") belonging to the Nishi ("Western") Honganji. The other kyōdan are Hawaiʻi, Jodo Shinshu Buddhist Temples of Canada, and South America. The BCA's headquarters is at 1710 Octavia Street, San Francisco, near Japantown. It is the oldest Buddhist organization in the mainland United States. Origins and development The origins of the Buddhist Churches of America (BCA) or American Buddhist Churches (ABC) began with the arrival of Japanese immigrants to the American mainland during the late 1800s. Devout Shin Buddhists who had expressed concern over the lack of religious services, and the activities of Christian missionaries among the newly-arrived immigrant population, petitioned the monshu (head abbot) of the Nishi Honganji to send priests to the US. The first Jōdo Shinshū priests arrived in San Francisco in 1893, and the first American temple constructed in 1899. The priests' arrival was a source of concern to the Japanese consul to the U.S.
