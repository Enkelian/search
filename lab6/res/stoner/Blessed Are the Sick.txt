Blessed Are the Sick
Blessed Are the Sick is the second studio album from death metal band Morbid Angel. Though the album features some fast sections, the overall sound is markedly slower than the debut and features marked classical music undertones (main composer Trey Azagthoth would dedicate this album to Mozart). Tracks 9, 10 and 12 are re-recorded songs from the 1986 demo Abominations of Desolation. The cover painting is "Les Trésors de Satan" by Jean Delville. The album was reissued in 2009 as a Digipak in DualDisc format. The CD side contains the original audio release and the DVD side contains a one-hour documentary. Track listing All lyrics are written by David Vincent, except where noted; all music is composed by Trey Azagthoth, except "Desolate Ways" by Richard Brunelle..
