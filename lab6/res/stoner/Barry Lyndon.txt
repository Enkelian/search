Barry Lyndon is a 1975 period drama film written, directed and produced by Stanley Kubrick, based on the 1844 novel The Luck of Barry Lyndon by William Makepeace Thackeray. It stars Ryan O'Neal, Marisa Berenson, Patrick Magee, Leonard Rossiter and Hardy Kr√ºger.

Kubrick began production on Barry Lyndon after his 1971 film, A Clockwork Orange.
