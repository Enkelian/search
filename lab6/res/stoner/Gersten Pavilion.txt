Gersten Pavilion
The Gersten Pavilion is a 3900-seat multi-purpose arena in Los Angeles, California. It is the home of the Loyola Marymount University Lions. It was built in 1981. It was also the part-time practice home for the Los Angeles Lakers. It was the site for the weightlifting competition for the 1984 Summer Olympics. On March 4, 1990, LMU star Hank Gathers died during a West Coast Conference men's basketball tournament game from cardiomyopathy. The tourney was promptly suspended and LMU was awarded the NCAA bid based on their regular season title. The facility also hosted the WCC tournament in 1997. The arena is known among LMU alumni as "Hank's House" in honor of Gathers. See also List of NCAA Division I basketball arenas References External links LMU Gersten Pavilion page
