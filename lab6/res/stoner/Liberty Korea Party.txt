Liberty Korea Party
The Liberty Korea Party (Korean: 자유한국당; Hanja: 自由韓國黨; RR: Jayuhangukdang) was a conservative political party in South Korea that was described variously as right-wing, right-wing populist, or far-right. Until February 2017, it was known as the Saenuri Party (Korean: 새누리당), and before that as the Hannara Party (Korean: 한나라당; lit. Grand National Party) from 1997 to 2012, both of which are still colloquially used to refer to the party. The party formerly held a plurality of seats in the 20th Assembly before its ruling status was transferred to the Democratic Party of Korea on December 27, 2016, following the creation of the splinter Bareun Party by former Saenuri members who distanced themselves from President Park Geun-hye in the 2016 South Korean political scandal. History 1997: Foundation of Hannara party The party was founded in 1997, when the United Democratic Party and New Korea Party merged. Its earliest ancestor was the Democratic Republican Party under the authoritarian rule of Park Chung-hee in 1963. On Park's death, and at the beginning of the rule of Chun Doo-hwan in 1980, it was reconstituted and renamed as the Democratic Justice Party. In 1988, party member Roh Tae-woo introduced a wide range of political reforms
