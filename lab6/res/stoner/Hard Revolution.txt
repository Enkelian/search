Hard Revolution
Hard Revolution is a crime novel written by George Pelecanos and set in Washington, DC. The main character of the book is Derek Strange, a black rookie police officer. The story is a prequel to other novels featuring Strange as a private detective. The book begins in 1959 when Strange is a child, setting the stage for the moral paths that the characters take as Pelecanos shows their evolution. The story then jumps to 1968 just after Strange joins the police force. As in all of Pelecanos’ books, Washington, DC is a character throughout the book, featuring major local landmarks, personalities and music. Another major theme in the book is race and racial tension. Throughout the book, Strange fought through the pressure of work and of peer for acceptance of his community. The book climaxes with the death of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and the 1968 Washington, D.C. riots, as Strange and veteran Detective Frank Vaughn search for the killer of Strange’s brother in the chaos. Critical reception A review in BookReport.com stated "Pelecanos's Washington, D.C. is not that of the edifices and facades of government; rather, he walks the streets that aren't mentioned in any guidebooks."A review in
