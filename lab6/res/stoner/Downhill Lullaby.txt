Downhill Lullaby
"Downhill Lullaby" is a song by American singer Sky Ferreira, released as the lead single from her upcoming second studio album Masochism on March 27, 2019. It is her first original material and single since 2014's "I Blame Myself". Background After various delays for new music spanning several years, Ferreira began hinting at an upcoming album in November 2018. In early March 2019, she stated on Twitter that the first song to be released from the album "is not a pop song". Composition In writing the track, Ferreira explained that she aimed to capture the sound of "the birds in Snow White, singing underwater, while slowly being suffocated by plastic." The song was described as a "five-and-a-half-minute, goth-noir, chamber-pop piece—with strings!—that could have easily closed an episode of the revived Twin Peaks." Critical reception "Downhill Lullaby" received universal acclaim from music critics. Rolling Stone's editor Brittany Spanos ranked the song as "Song You Need to Know" describing the song as "one of her finest and most melodramatic performances yet". Year-end lists Promotion Ferreira posted the cover art and announced the release date in a social media post on March 21, 2019. == References ==
