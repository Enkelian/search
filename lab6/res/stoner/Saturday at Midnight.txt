The band had performed the song earlier on the Laugh Trax in 1982, along with "She's Tight". Critical reception In a review of One on One, AllMusic stated: "There are several truly odd detours on the album, usually when the group veers too strongly toward the new wave, like on the awkward, clanking "Saturday at Midnight" and the stiff Devo misinterpretation "I Want Be Man." These tracks accentuate the album's 1982 artifact appeal, but ironically, are the things that kept it from being a blockbuster at the time." Track listing
