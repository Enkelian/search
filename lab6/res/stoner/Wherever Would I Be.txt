Reviewing the song for AllMusic, Doug Stone commented: "Cheap Trick sleepwalks through the motions on this Diane Warren treacle. Loopy axe murderer Rick Nielsen steps up for a decent guitar solo, but no rock band should put fans through something like this. On the back is "Busted," the title track to Trick's nadir. Cheap Trick is so much above the material on both sides here."
