God & Guns is the thirteenth studio album by the southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd, released on September 29, 2009. The single "Still Unbroken" was released on July 27, 2009 followed by another track, "Simple Life", on August 4, 2009. "Still Unbroken" was written after the death of original bassist Leon Wilkeson in 2001. It was the theme song of WWEâ€™s Breaking Point PPV event and is featured on WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010. "God & Guns" was the last Lynyrd Skynyrd album to feature the band's longtime keyboardist Billy Powell, who died in January 2009. Ean Evans, who had replaced Leon Wilkeson on bass, also died before this album came out. The late Hughie Thomasson (dec.2007) had contributed to the writing of many songs, but recording did not begin until 2008 and he does not play on the album. This album is the first with guitarist Mark Matejka.
