The Great American Steak Religion
The Great American Steak Religion was a Canadian independent record label which released many notable hardcore records from the likes of Shotmaker, His Hero Is Gone, and Chokehold during the 1990s. Originally based in Ottawa at 5 Arlington Ave, founder Yannick Lorrain moved to Quebec City and then Montreal, taking the label with him. In 2004 the last release under this label was issued, the Union Of Uranus discography titled To This Bearer Of Truth. Many of the releases were issued only on vinyl and were etched with the word "Verse" and then a number, hence the tagging of each release as such.
