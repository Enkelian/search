Morus (plant)
Morus, a genus of flowering plants in the family Moraceae, consists of diverse species of deciduous trees commonly known as mulberries, growing wild and under cultivation in many temperate world regions. Generally, the plant has three main species by color of its fruits: white, red, and black mulberry, with numerous cultivars, but more than 200 species are identified in taxonomy. It is native to Southern Asia, but is widely distributed across Europe, South Africa, South America, and North America. It is regarded as an invasive species in Brazil.The closely related genus Broussonetia is also commonly known as mulberry, notably the paper mulberry, Broussonetia papyrifera. Description Mulberries are fast-growing when young, and can grow to 80 feet (24 m) tall. The leaves are alternately arranged, simple, and often lobed and serrated on the margin. Lobes are more common on juvenile shoots than on mature trees. The trees can be monoecious or dioecious.The mulberry fruit is a multiple, about 2–3 cm (3⁄4–1 1⁄4 in) long. Immature fruits are white, green, or pale yellow. The fruit turns from pink to red while ripening, then dark purple or black, and has a sweet flavor when fully ripe.
