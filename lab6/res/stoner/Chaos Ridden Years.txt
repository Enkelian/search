Chaos Ridden Years
Chaos Ridden Years is a live album by Finnish melodic death metal band Children of Bodom. The release was released on Spinefarm Records both as a live album entitled Chaos Ridden Years on October, 2006 and the DVD version entitled Stockholm Knockout Live - Chaos Ridden Years on October 11, 2006, directed by Patric Ullaeus. The album is a live show from Arenan, Stockholm, Sweden and contains: a documentary of the band, the making of the album, deleted scenes, a photo gallery, and seven promotional videos. Laiho said in an interview with the Finnish music magazine Soundi that he did not want to record the DVD in Finland, because it was going to be an international release, and it would be ridiculous making speeches between the songs in English in the band's homeland Finland.
