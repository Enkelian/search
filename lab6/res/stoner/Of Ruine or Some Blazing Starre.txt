Of Ruine or Some Blazing Starre
Of Ruine or Some Blazing Starre - The Broken Heart of Man is an album by English band Current 93. Although musically one of Current 93's gentlest albums it is also lyrically very dark, prominently featuring the motif of blood, menstrual and otherwise. David Tibet states in the liner notes that all songs should be regarded as one piece of music; indeed, the album is similar to a stream-of-consciousness narrative, and several tracks contain similar - and in some cases, identical - musical themes. For example, the last three tracks were intended as a single piece, and are often performed live as such. Portions of the song are also musically identical to the Thunder Perfect Mind-era live song "Imperium V", which serves as a lyrical prelude as well.
