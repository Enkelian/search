Dumfries
Dumfries ( (listen) dum-FREESS; possibly from Scottish Gaelic: Dùn Phris) is a market town and former royal burgh within the Dumfries and Galloway council area of Scotland. It is located near the mouth of the River Nith into the Solway Firth. Dumfries is the traditional county town of the historic county of Dumfriesshire. Dumfries is nicknamed Queen of the South. The nickname has also given name to the town's professional football club. People from Dumfries are known colloquially in Scots language as Doonhamers. Toponymy There are at least three theories on the etymology of the name. One is that the name Dumfries originates from the Scottish Gaelic name Dùn Phris which means "Fort of the Thicket". Another is that it comes from a Brittonic cognate of the alleged Gaelic derivation (Welsh Din Prys). Dumfries may be the same place as Penprys, which is mentioned in an awdl by Taliesin, and suggests that the first element may have originally been pen, "summit, head" (Welsh pen). According to a third theory, the name is a corruption of two Old English or Old Norse words which mean "the Friars’ Hill"; those who favour this idea allege the formation of a religious house near
