Laika (band)
Laika were an English band founded in 1993 by Margaret Fiedler (vocals, programming) and John Frenett (bass), both formerly of Moonshake, along with producer Guy Fixsen and other artists associated with the label Too Pure. Their experimental style blended diverse genres, including electronica, krautrock, dub, hip-hop, and jazz. They released their debut album Silver Apples of the Moon in 1995, and followed with 1997's Sounds of the Satellites, both to critical praise. History 1993: Formation Margaret Fiedler moved from New York City to London in 1989 in search of music which better suited her interests. The first significant band she joined was Moonshake, in which she was one of two lead vocalists, a songwriter and a multi-instrumentalist predominantly playing guitar, keyboards and samplers. Moonshake's songwriting was split between Fiedler and the other singer, David Callahan, who had a very different style: Callahan favoured an art-punk storytelling approach with a dub/funk undercurrent while Fiedler preferred a more enveloping and abstract approach drawing on rhythmic Krautrock-esque loops and murmured vocals. The early Moonshake records, released on the Too Pure label, were engineered by the producer Guy Fixsen, who had also worked with bands including My Bloody Valentine and The Breeders.The creative tensions
