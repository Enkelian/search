AVI Global Trust
AVI Global Trust (LSE: AGT) is a large London-based British investment trust dedicated to investments in companies trading at a discount to Net Asset Value. Established as British Empire Trust in 1889, the company is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index. The chairman is Susan Noble. The firm's recent history dates to 1985, when Asset Value Investors, an employee-owned management company was established to manage the firm, then valued at £6 million.Its goal of acquiring firms under NAV has led it to attempt takeovers of other investment trusts trading at a discount. In 1986 the company acquired Ashdown Investment Trust for £66 million. In 1989 it mounted a hostile takeover bid for Schroder Global Trust. In 1995 it acquired the Selective Assets Trust (formerly the Edinburgh Assets Trust) for £42 million. It changed its name from British Empire Trust to AVI Global Trust in May 2019.
