Death Cult (EP)
Death Cult is the debut four-track EP by the post punk/gothic rock band Death Cult (who later shortened their name to the Cult). Released in July 1983 on the Situation Two label, the EP reached No. 2 on the UK Independent Chart. The EP is often erroneously referred to as Brothers Grimm (after the song title of the first track on the A-side of the record). In 1988, the EP was released on compact disc coupled with the contents of the group's only other official release, "Gods Zoo", retaining the same eponymous title. In 1996, the contents of the 1988 CD release were remastered and reissued with an additional four tracks from a BBC Radio 1 session. This release was titled Ghost Dance. Development Death Cult formed in April 1983 when Ian Astbury (formerly of Southern Death Cult) and Billy Duffy (formerly of Theatre of Hate) joined forces after meeting each other when Southern Death Cult supported Theatre of Hate on a number of dates during the latter's tour. By June 1983, the group had written 10 songs, four of which would be recorded for their debut EP.The first track, "Brothers Grimm", was originally written by Duffy and UK Decay
