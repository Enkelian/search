Charred Walls of the Damned
Charred Walls of the Damned is an American heavy metal supergroup formed in 2009 consisting of drummer Richard Christy, bassist Steve Di Giorgio, vocalist Tim "Ripper" Owens and guitarist Jason Suecof. The band was formed by Christy after a five-year absence from the metal scene since joining The Howard Stern Show in 2004. They have released three studio albums. History Formation While Iced Earth were on their 2004 Glorious Burden tour, drummer Richard Christy decided to depart from the band, thus postponing upcoming dates in Japan. He became a finalist in "Get John's Job", a listener contest on The Howard Stern Show to replace "Stuttering John" Melendez, who left to become the announcer for The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Having not participated would have made him "regret it every day of [his] life". On July 1, 2004, Christy won the contest with 30% of the listener vote.With his busy work schedule in New York City, Christy kept in touch with his musical roots. He built confidence in his guitar playing and song writing, putting together an entire demo album of material. He returned from a ​5 1⁄2-year absence from music, announcing his new band, Charred Walls of the Damned.
