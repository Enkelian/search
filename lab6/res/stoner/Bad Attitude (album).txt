Bad Attitude (album)
Bad Attitude is the fourth studio album by Meat Loaf released in November 1984. Recorded in England, it features two songs by Jim Steinman, both previously recorded, and a duet with Roger Daltrey. According to Meat Loaf's autobiography, he approached Steinman about writing the entire album, but waiting for new songs wound up taking so long that Meat Loaf recorded two previously released Steinman songs and moved on with other writers. The album concentrates more on the hard rock side of Meat Loaf, was a minor success around the globe and released a few hit singles, the most successful being "Modern Girl". The US release from April, 1985 on RCA Records features a slightly different track listing as well as alternate mixes for some songs.
