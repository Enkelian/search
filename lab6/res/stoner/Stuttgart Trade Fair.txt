Stuttgart Trade Fair
Messe Stuttgart is an exhibition and trade fair centre next to Stuttgart Airport, 7 miles south of Stuttgart, Germany. It is the ninth biggest trade fair in Germany. The new exhibition grounds, which were completed in 2007, are right next to the A8 autobahn (motorway). The centre is accessible from Stuttgart Flughafen/Messe station on the local suburban railway network. Buses also travel to the trade fair centre from nearby Esslingen, Göppingen, Reutlingen and Tübingen. As part of the Stuttgart 21 Project, there are plans to link the trade fair centre and airport to the proposed Stuttgart–Wendlingen high-speed railway between Stuttgart and Ulm by 2019. Car park One of the most striking features of Stuttgart Messe is its huge car park which spans the A8 Autobahn. The car park has space for 4200 vehicles on five stories. Display rights for the 4 ton logo on both sides of the car park bridge were sold to Robert Bosch GmbH who paid around 20 million euros for exclusive advertising space. The logo is the second largest illuminated sign in the world and the biggest logo in the world after the unlit Hollywood Sign. Brief history Before completion of the new site next to
