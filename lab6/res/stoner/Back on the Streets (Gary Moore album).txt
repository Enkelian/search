Back on the Streets (Gary Moore album)
Back on the Streets is an album by Northern Irish blues-rock guitarist Gary Moore, released in 1978, and his first authentic solo record (1973's Grinding Stone album being credited to The Gary Moore Band). Thin Lizzy bassist/vocalist Phil Lynott and drummer Brian Downey appear on four songs, including "Don't Believe A Word" (which originally appeared on the 1976 Thin Lizzy album Johnny the Fox) and the UK top 10 single "Parisienne Walkways". On the album's sleeve, Moore is depicted leaving notorious prison Wormwood Scrubs in the Inner London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham in a photograph by Chalkie Davies. The album was re-issued in 1989 by Grand Slam Records with a revised playing order and an additional track ("Spanish Guitar"). More bonus tracks were available for download and on the Universal Music Group Remastered CD edition of 2013. The tracks "Road of Pain" and "Track Ten" recorded in the same sessions, remain at the moment unreleased. Yet another release with title Back on the Streets, but no other apparent connection to the original album, is a 2003 compilation of Gary Moore's greatest hits.
