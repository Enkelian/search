Chequered Past
Chequered Past was a Britishâ€“American rock supergroup led by actor/singer Michael Des Barres and featuring members of Blondie, the Sex Pistols and Tin Machine. They formed in 1982 and released one, self-titled, album in 1984 on EMI Records. The group stopped performing when lead singer Des Barres was recruited to replace Robert Palmer in Power Station. History The band started in New York City as a cover band, with their first show being at the Peppermint Lounge on September 26, 1982 and the first song they ever performed live was "Vacation" by The Go-Go's. Des Barres described the music as "New York Dolls in a home for senior citizens".Nigel Harrison (of Blondie) had often collaborated with Michael Des Barres, and when Des Barres toured in 1981 to support his album I'm Only Human, Harrison was part of his touring band. Des Barres first met Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones in 1978 at the Sex Pistols' San Francisco show at the Winterland Ballroom. It was Jones' girlfriend who first suggested that Jones and Des Barres form a band, and the initial line-up was rounded out by Harrison and two more members of the recently disbanded Blondie, Clem Burke and Frank Infante.
