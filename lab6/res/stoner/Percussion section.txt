Percussion section
The percussion section is one of the main divisions of the orchestra and the concert band. It includes most percussion instruments and all unpitched instruments. The percussion section is itself divided into three subsections: Pitched percussion, consisting of pitched instruments such as glockenspiel and tubular bells. Auxiliary percussion, consisting of all unpitched instruments such as snare drum and cymbals. Timpani.These three subsections reflect the three main skill areas that a percussionist studies. Percussion sections, consisting of similar instruments, may also be found in stage bands and other musical ensembles. Tuned percussion See also untuned percussionThis subsection is traditionally called tuned percussion, however the corresponding term untuned percussion is avoided in modern organology in favour of the term unpitched percussion, so the instruments of this subsection are similarly termed pitched percussion. All instruments of this subsection are pitched, and with the exception of the timpani, all pitched instruments of the percussion section are in this subsection. They include: All mallet percussion instruments, and keyboard percussion instruments such as the xylophone and tubular bells. Collections of pitched instruments such as hand bells, tuned cowbells and crotales. Most other melodic percussion instruments.Despite the name, keyboard percussion instruments do not have keyboards as such.
