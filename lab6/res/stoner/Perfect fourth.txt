Perfect fourth
A fourth is a musical interval encompassing four staff positions in the music notation of Western culture, and a perfect fourth (Play ) is the fourth spanning five semitones (half steps, or half tones). For example, the ascending interval from C to the next F is a perfect fourth, because the note F is the fifth semitone above C, and there are four staff positions between C and F. Diminished and augmented fourths span the same number of staff positions, but consist of a different number of semitones (four and six, respectively). The perfect fourth may be derived from the harmonic series as the interval between the third and fourth harmonics. The term perfect identifies this interval as belonging to the group of perfect intervals, so called because they are neither major nor minor (unlike thirds, which are either minor or major) but perfect. A perfect fourth in just intonation corresponds to a pitch ratio of 4:3, or about 498 cents (Play ), while in equal temperament a perfect fourth is equal to five semitones, or 500 cents (see additive synthesis). Until the late 19th century, the perfect fourth was often called by its Greek name, diatessaron. Its most common
