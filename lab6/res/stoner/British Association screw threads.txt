British Association screw threads
British Association screw threads, or BA screw threads, are a largely obsolete set of small screw threads, the largest being 0BA at 6 mm diameter. They were, and to some extent still are, used for miniature instruments and modelling. They are unusual in that they were probably the most "scientific" design of screw, starting with 0BA at 6.0 mm diameter and 1.0 mm pitch and progressing in a geometric sequence where each larger number was 0.9 times the pitch of the last size. They then rounded to 2 significant figures in metric and then converting to inches and rounding to the thousandth of an inch. This anticipated worldwide metrication by about a century. The design was first proposed by the British Association in 1884 with a thread angle and depth based on the Swiss Thury thread, it was adopted by the Association in 1903. The Thury thread was different in that it went both positive and negative all the way up to a size of âˆ’20 which was 75.2 mm diameter by 8.23 mm pitch (p). The Thury numbers were rounded to three significant figures. The Thury thread form had the crests rounded at 1/6p and the roots rounded at
