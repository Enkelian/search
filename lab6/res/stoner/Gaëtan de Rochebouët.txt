Gaëtan de Rochebouët
Gaëtan de Grimaudet de Rochebouët (French: [ɡa.etɑ̃ də ʁɔʃbu.ɛ]; 1813–1899) was a French general who served as Prime Minister for less than a month in late 1877.On 29 June 1877, Patrice de MacMahon dissolved the House after being outvoted. The elections of 14 October 1877 were a victory for Republicans, who won a majority of seats. President MacMahon at first attempted to resist. He asked the General Rochebouet form a "department of business", with which the House refused to deal: Rochebouet resigned less than 24 hours after his appointment. MacMahon decided to accept the conditions of Julius Dufaure, forming a new, left of center government.
