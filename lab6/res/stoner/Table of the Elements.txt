Table of the Elements
Table of the Elements is an American record label. It concentrates on re-released and specially recorded experimental music, including many avant-garde musicians of the 20th and 21st centuries, such as John Cale, Tony Conrad and La Monte Young, as well as lesser-known artists such as Loren Mazzacane Connors, Derek Bailey, Rhys Chatham, Fushitsusha/Keiji Haino, and Mats Gustafsson. The label numbers its releases to correspond to symbols from the periodic table in increasing order of atomic weight, rather than using the traditional numerical system. The label hosted multiple-day experimental music festivals. It also releases recordings under two other imprints, Radium and Xeric.
