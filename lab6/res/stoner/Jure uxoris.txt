Jure uxoris
Jure uxoris (a Latin phrase meaning "by right of (his) wife") is a title of nobility used by a man because his wife holds the office or title suo jure ("in her own right"). Similarly, the husband of an heiress could become the legal possessor of her lands. For example, married women in England were legally incapable of owning real estate until the Married Women's Property Act 1882. Kings who ruled jure uxoris were regarded as co-rulers with their wives and are not to be confused with kings consort, who were merely consorts of their wives. Middle Ages During the feudal era, the husband's control over his wife's real property, including titles, was substantial. On marriage, the husband gained the right to possess his wife's land during the marriage, including any acquired after the marriage. Whilst he did not gain the formal legal title to the lands, he was able to spend the rents and profits of the land and sell his right, even if the wife protested.The concept of jure uxoris was standard in the Middle Ages even for queens regnant.
