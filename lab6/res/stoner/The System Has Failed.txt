The System Has Failed
The System Has Failed is the tenth studio album by American heavy metal band Megadeth, released on September 14, 2004. It was the band's second and final studio album to be distributed by Sanctuary Records. The System Has Failed was the first album to be released after Mustaine recovered from his arm injury sustained in 2002 which prevented him from playing guitar. It is also the first of three Megadeth records not to include original bassist and co-founder David Ellefson.

"Die Dead Enough" and "Of Mice and Men" were released as
