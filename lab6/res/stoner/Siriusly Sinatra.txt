Siriusly Sinatra
Siriusly Sinatra is a pop standards-oriented music channel featured on Sirius XM Radio channel 71, and DISH Network channel 6071. The channel, which first aired on Sirius as Standard Time, acquired its current name in February 2007 after Sirius inked a licensing deal with the Frank Sinatra estate. (Previously, the Sinatra name graced XM's standards channel, which was first called Frank's Place and later High Standards.) The programming remained essentially the same but with the amount of Sinatra music upped, including several new regular shows. Approximately 50% of the musical selections played on Siriusly Sinatra are recordings by Frank Sinatra. In November 2008, following a merger between Sirius and XM, the High Standards channel was eliminated from XM's lineup and Siriusly Sinatra became the standards channel for both services. Jonathan Schwartz, who had been the program director and on-air voice of XM's channel, continued to be heard on Siriusly Sinatra until August 2011, when he moved to the '40s on 4 channel.
