Baldwin Hills (mountain range)
The Baldwin Hills are a low mountain range surrounded by and rising above the Los Angeles Basin plain in central Los Angeles County, California. The Pacific Ocean is to the west, the Santa Monica Mountains to the north, Downtown Los Angeles to the northeast, and the Palos Verdes Hills to the south - with all easily viewed from the Baldwin Hills. Geography The headwaters of Ballona Creek are in the hills, which then flows west into the Santa Monica Bay. La Cienega Boulevard goes through a pass in the hills between the Westside and the Southwestern area towns and Los Angeles International Airport. It passes the oil wells of the Inglewood Oil Field in the southern Baldwin Hills. History Rancho La Cienega o Paso de la Tijera - eastern area Sanchez Adobe de Rancho La Cienega o Paso de la Tijera.
