The Glasspack
The Glasspack is a psychedelic punk rock band from Louisville, Kentucky. The band was formed in 1999 by frontman and native Louisvillian "Dirty" Dave Johnson in hopes of giving a better alternative to the classic and hard rock played over-and-over on the radio. The Glasspack has since recorded 1 garage ep, 2 garage LPs, 2 studio LPs, and numerous cover songs as well as toured the U.S. relentlessly. Three of the LPs were released on Detroit's Small Stone Records, also known for such bands as Men of Porn, Honky, and Five Horse Johnson. The band takes its name from the high-flow fiber-glass filled automobile muffler known as a glasspack, which are known for being remarkably louder than traditional mufflers. The band's music from their 2004 release Bridgeburner[1] has been featured in MTV shows Viva La Bam (Season 3, Episodes 7&8) and Homewrecker (Season 1, Episodes 104&107). Also the band's music from their 2007 release Dirty Women[2] was used in FX's motorcycle club television show Sons of Anarchy (Season 2, Episode 209). The band also has tracks from its 2002 Powderkeg[3] release in video games MLB 2K5 (2K Sports Major League Baseball series) and Amped 3, both made by 2K Sports.
