Semi-arid climate
A semi-arid climate or steppe climate is the climate of a region that receives precipitation below potential evapotranspiration, but not as low as a desert climate. There are different kinds of semi-arid climates, depending on variables such as temperature, and they give rise to different biomes. Defining attributes of semi-arid climates A more precise definition is given by the Köppen climate classification, which treats steppe climates (BSk and BSh) as intermediates between desert climates (BW) and humid climates in ecological characteristics and agricultural potential. Semi-arid climates tend to support short or scrubby vegetation and are usually dominated by either grasses or shrubs. To determine if a location has a semi-arid climate, the precipitation threshold must first be determined. The method used to find the precipitation threshold (in millimeters): multiplying by 20 the average annual temperature in degrees Celsius and then adding 280 if at least 70% of the total precipitation falls in the high-sun half of the year (April–September in the northern hemisphere, October–March in the southern hemisphere) adding 140 if 30–70% of the total precipitation falls in the high-sun half of the year not adding anything if the less than 30% of the total precipitation falls in the high-sun
