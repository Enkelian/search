Supergroup (bands)
A supergroup is a musical performing group whose members have successful solo careers, are members of other groups, or are well known in other musical professions. The term is usually used in the context of rock and pop music, but it has occasionally been applied to other musical genres. For example, The Three Tenors—composed of opera superstars José Carreras, Plácido Domingo, and Luciano Pavarotti—have been called a supergroup.A supergroup sometimes forms like a side project, with no intention that the group will remain together. In other instances, the group may become the primary project of the members' careers. It became popular in the late 1960s rock music for members of already successful groups to record albums together, after which they normally split up. Charity supergroups, in which prominent musicians perform or record together in support of a particular cause, have been common since the 1980s. History Rolling Stone editor Jann Wenner credited Cream, which came together in 1966, as the first supergroup. Eric Clapton, formerly of The Yardbirds; Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker, formerly of the Graham Bond Organization and John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers, formed the band in 1966, recorded four albums, and split up in 1968.
