'68 (band)
'68 is an American noise punk duo from Atlanta, Georgia. Formed in 2013 by guitarist and vocalist Josh Scogin—formerly of the hardcore punk band The Chariot—and drummer Michael McClellan, the band currently comprises Scogin and drummer Nikko Yamada. History Formation and debut album Josh Scogin's former band, The Chariot, played their final show in November 2013. Just over a week later, Scogin teased an announcement with a countdown timer on the website theyare68.com; when the timer ended in December 2013, Scogin revealed that he had formed a new band named '68 and posted a two-song EP titled Midnight for sale online. The title of the EP and its two songs—"Three Is a Crowd" and "Third Time Is a Charm"—are significant to Scogin; the use of the number three in the song titles represents the third act of his life following his stints in Norma Jean and The Chariot, and Scogin also explained that three represents "that thought process of continuing on in my head: 'Three's a charm,' oh, this is gonna be great or 'three's a crowd,' like we should've stuck with The Chariot." The initial pressing of Midnight sold out in less than one day; independent record label No
