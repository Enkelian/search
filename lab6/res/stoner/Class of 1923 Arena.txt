Class of 1923 Arena
The Class of 1923 Arena is the skating rink of the University of Pennsylvania. In 1968, alumni from the Class of 1923 formed the group "Friends of Pennsylvania Hockey," led by Howard Butcher, III. Butcher himself donated over $3 million for the creation of the facility, and along with John Cleveland and Bill R. Wise, organized the largest class donation in the history of the university. The arena was named after the class to commemorate its generosity. The arena is located in the eastern part of Penn's campus in the University City section of Philadelphia. It can seat nearly 3,000 people. The building, designed by Robert C. McMillian Associates, was constructed primarily of poured concrete and is supported by four 22-foot concrete columns.

The ice surface itself measures 85' Ã— 200' and totals 18,000 square feet (1,700 m2). The upper concourse includes restrooms and old concession stands that are no longer in use, with entrances on Walnut Street.
