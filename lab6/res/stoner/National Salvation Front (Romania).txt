National Salvation Front (Romania)
The National Salvation Front (Romanian: Frontul Salvării Naționale, FSN) is the name of a political organization that was the governing body of Romania in the first weeks after the Romanian Revolution in 1989. It subsequently became a political party, and won the 1990 election under the leadership of then-President Ion Iliescu. In 1992, some members of the Front, including President Iliescu, broke away from it, forming the Democratic National Salvation Front. In 1993 the remaining FSN was renamed as the Democratic Party. The National Salvation Front is the common ancestor of two of the largest active political parties in Romania today: the Social Democratic Party and the National Liberal Party (after the merger of the Democratic Liberal Party with the National Liberal Party).
