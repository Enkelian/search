Kenny Everett
Maurice James Christopher Cole (25 December 1944 â€“ 4 April 1995), better known as Kenny Everett, was a British comedian and radio disc jockey known for his irreverent, offbeat comedic style and easy-going personality. After spells on pirate radio and Radio Luxembourg in the mid-1960s, he was one of the first DJs to join BBC radio's newly-created Radio 1 in 1967. It was here he developed his trademark voices and surreal characters which he later adapted for television. Everett was dismissed from the BBC in 1970 after making remarks about a government minister's wife. He returned to commercial radio when it became licensed in the UK, and joined Capital Radio. Starting in the late 1970s, he transitioned to television where he made numerous comedy series on ITV and BBC, often appearing with Cleo Rocos, whose glamorous and curvaceous figure was often used to comic effect. Everett was a politically right-of-centre media star who openly supported the British Conservative Party and made publicity appearances at conferences and rallies. However, as a gay man, he faced criticism for supporting the UK Conservative government after it had enacted Section 28, a clause of the Local Government Act which made it illegal for councils
