Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin
The Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin (Persian: حزب اسلامی گلبدین‎; abbreviated HIG), also referred to as Hezb-e-Islami or Hezb-i-Islami Afghanistan (HIA), is an Afghan political party and former militia, founded and led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. Since 1979, when Mulavi Younas Khalis made a split with Hekmatyar and established his own group, the remaining part of Hezb-e Islami, still headed by Hekmatyar, was known as 'Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin' or HIG. During the Soviet–Afghan War (1979–1989), Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin was well-financed by anti-Soviet forces through the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). In the mid-1990s, the HIG was "sidelined from Afghan politics" by the rise of the Taliban. In the post-2001 war in Afghanistan, HIG "reemerged as an aggressive militant group, claiming responsibility for many bloody attacks against Coalition forces and the administration of President Hamid Karzai". Its fighting strength was "sometimes estimated to number in the thousands". The group signed a peace deal with the Ghani administration in 2016.
