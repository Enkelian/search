Bathwick was part of the hundred of Bath Forum.The district became part of the Bath urban area with the 18th century development of the Pulteney estate and the building of Pulteney Bridge. Following various Georgian streets were built including Sydney Place, Great Pulteney Street and Laura Place, with Bathwick Hill leading up to Claverton Down and the University of Bath. It is also home to the Holburne Museum of Art within Sydney Gardens. Bathwick has two churches, St Mary the Virgin, Bathwick (consecrated 1820) and St John the Baptist, Bathwick, firmly within the Anglo Catholic tradition. The Church of St Mary the Virgin, which was built in the early 19th century by John Pinch the elder, was where the band Muse recorded the organ parts on their second studio album Origin of Symmetry.
