The Big Eyeball in the Sky
The Big Eyeball in the Sky is the 2004 album by Colonel Claypool's Bucket of Bernie Brains, known by fans as "C2B3," released on Les Claypool's own Prawn Song label. Reception AllMusic gave the album an above average review, writing: "The eyeball-dominated graphics seem like an homage to the Residents and the music similarly aims for an experimental collision between that legendary far-out band's non-commercial approach and a Frank Zappa-styled jazz-rock blend." Track listing All tracks are written by Les Claypool, Buckethead, Bernie Worrell, and Bryan Mantia. Trivia The song Junior was written about the Iraq war and is a criticique of the Bush Administrations foreign policy.
