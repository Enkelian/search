Siebenbürgen (band)
Siebenbürgen was a melodic black metal band from Stockholm, Sweden, formed in 1994. Biography The band was formed in 1994 by Marcus Ehlin and Anders Rosdahl, who were joined within a few months by Fredrik Brockert. In February 1996 they recorded their first, self-titled, demo tape. After the demos release, the band was joined by Linus Ekström. By this time, they had started playing gigs, supporting Swedish metal acts including Bewitched, Sacramentum and In Aeturnum. During the Halloween weekend of 1996 Siebenbürgen recorded their second demo, Ungentum Pharelis. This demo led to a contract with Napalm Records, and their release of their first album, Loreia, in 1997. In October/November 1997, Siebenbürgen had three shows in Germany, with Forbidden Site and Menhir. During January/February 1998, Siebenbürgen recorded their second album, Grimjaur, which was released in May the same year, followed by another tour in July, this time with Atanatos and Ragnarök.

She was replaced in 1999 with a new female vocalist, Kicki Höijertz. On their next tour, Siebenbürgen were accompanied by Tristania, The Sins of Thy Beloved, Trail of Tears
