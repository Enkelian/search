Helsinki Ice Hall
Helsinki Ice Hall (Finnish: Helsingin jäähalli, Swedish: Helsingfors ishall) is an indoor arena located in Helsinki, Finland. It has a seating capacity of 8,400. History It is the home arena for HIFK of the SM-liiga. It is sometimes called "Nordis" or "Petoluola", Finnish for "The beast cave", referring to the 2nd logo of HIFK: a red panther. Helsinki Ice Hall used to be the main arena for all important ice sports events, as well as indoor arena concerts, but after the construction of HK Areena and Hartwall Areena, many events take place in the newer arenas. Nevertheless, the Helsinki Ice Hall still remains an active arena for concerts, conferences, expos and sports events. During the 2016 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, games were played there.
