Southeast Texas
Southeast Texas is a sub-region of East Texas. It is geographically centered on the Greater Houston and Beaumontâ€“Port Arthur metropolitan areas. Geography Southeast Texas includes part of the coast of the Gulf of Mexico and most of the Texas portion of the Intracoastal Waterway. The area is also crossed by numerous rivers and streams, the largest three being the Sabine River, the Neches River, and the Trinity River.
