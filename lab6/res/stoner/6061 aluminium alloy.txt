6061 aluminium alloy
6061 is a precipitation-hardened aluminum alloy, containing magnesium and silicon as its major alloying elements. Originally called "Alloy 61S", it was developed in 1935. It has good mechanical properties, exhibits good weldability, and is very commonly extruded (second in popularity only to 6063). It is one of the most common alloys of aluminum for general-purpose use. It is commonly available in pre-tempered grades such as 6061-O (annealed), tempered grades such as 6061-T6 (solutionized and artificially aged) and 6061-T651 (solutionized, stress-relieved stretched and artificially aged). Chemical composition Properties The mechanical properties of 6061 depend greatly on the temper, or heat treatment, of the material. Young's Modulus is 69 GPa (10,000 ksi) regardless of temper. 6061-O Annealed 6061 (6061-O temper) has maximum ultimate tensile strength no more than 150 MPa (22 ksi), and maximum yield strength no more than 83 MPa (12 ksi) or 110 MPa (16 ksi). The material has elongation (stretch before ultimate failure) of 10–18%. To obtain the annealed condition, the alloy is typically heated at 415 °C for 2-3 hours. 6061-T4 T4 temper 6061 has an ultimate tensile strength of at least 180 MPa (26 ksi) or 210 MPa (30 ksi) and yield strength of at least 110
