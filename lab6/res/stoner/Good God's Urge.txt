Good God's Urge
Good God's Urge is the second and final studio album by American alternative rock band Porno for Pyros, released on May 28, 1996 on Warner Bros. It was the band's only album to feature bass guitarist Mike Watt, who assisted the band in finishing the album after Martyn LeNoble left before all his bass tracks had been completed. There were three singles released from the album. In addition to Watt, many guest musicians lent their musical talents to various songs. The song "Porpoise Head" featured Daniel Ash, David J and Kevin Haskins from Bauhaus, Love and Rockets and the Bubblemen. Good God's Urge also marked a reunion of ex-Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro, who played guitar on the album track "Freeway," with his former bandmates. The song also featured Navarro's Red Hot Chili Peppers bandmate, Flea, who would join Farrell, Perkins and Navarro for a Jane's Addiction reunion the following year. Farrell's then-girlfriend, Christine Cagle, appeared on the album cover.Porno for Pyros went on a brief hiatus shortly after this album's release because guitarist Peter DiStefano was diagnosed with cancer.
