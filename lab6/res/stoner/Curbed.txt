There is also a national site, founded in 2010, that Steele once described as "Architectural Digest after a three-martini lunch.‚Äù The site hosts an annual contest, the Curbed Cup, to pick the best neighborhood in each city. Nice Try!, a Curbed podcast about utopias, was produced in 2019. On November 10, 2013, The New York Times reported that Vox Media had purchased the Curbed Network, which, apart from Curbed, also included dining website Eater and fashion website Racked. The paper reported that the cash-and-stock deal was worth between $20 million and $30 million. References External links Official website
