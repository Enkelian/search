Blaize Bailey
Blaize Bailey is a small hamlet and viewpoint on the eastern edge of the Forest of Dean, in Gloucestershire, England. The viewpoint was constructed using stone from a disused railway bridge at nearby Fetter Hill. It overlooks a horseshoe bend in the River Severn and, on a fine day, it is possible to see Gloucester Cathedral, Newnham on Severn and the Cotswold Hills.
