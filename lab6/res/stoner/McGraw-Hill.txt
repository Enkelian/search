McGraw-Hill
McGraw-Hill is a learning science company and one of the "big three" educational publishers that provides customized educational content, software, and services for pre-K through postgraduate education. The company also provides reference and trade publications for the medical, business, and engineering professions. McGraw-Hill currently operates in 28 countries, has more than 5,000 employees globally, and offers products and services to over 135 countries in 60+ languages. Formerly a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies (later renamed McGraw Hill Financial, now S&P Global), McGraw-Hill Education (now "McGraw-Hill") was divested and acquired by Apollo Global Management in March 2013 for $2.4 billion in cash.Based on the growing demand for classroom technology, McGraw-Hill began offering digital products alongside traditional print products. This shift has accelerated in recent years with an increased focus on developing adaptive learning systems that enable classroom teaching to come closer to a one-to-one student-teacher interaction. These systems allow personalized learning that assesses each student's skill level and uses data to determine how each can progress through lessons most effectively. McGraw-Hill now provides digital products and services to over 11 million users on over 1,500 adaptive products in higher education and digital formats for its major K-12 programs. history McGraw-Hill was
