Global strategic petroleum reserves
Global strategic petroleum reserves (GSPR) refer to crude oil inventories (or stockpiles) held by the government of a particular country, as well as private industry, to safeguard the economy and help maintain national security during an energy crisis. According to the United States Energy Information Administration, approximately 4.1 billion barrels (650,000,000 m3) of oil are held in strategic reserves, of which 1.4 billion is government-controlled. The remainder is held by private industry. In 2004 the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve had the largest strategic reserve, with much of the remainder held by the other 27 members of the International Energy Agency. Some non-IEA countries have started work on their own strategic petroleum reserves. China has the largest of these new reserves. Global oil consumption is in the region of 0.1 billion barrels (16,000,000 m3) per day. The 4.1 bbl reserve is equivalent to 41 days of production. The reserve is intended to be used to cover short term supply disruptions. Covering a 50% shortfall would deplete the reserves in 82 days, although export leaders the Middle East and Russian exports represent only 22% and 6% respectively of global production.
