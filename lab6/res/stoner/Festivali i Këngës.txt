Festivali i Këngës (Albanian pronunciation: [fɛstival i kəngəs]; transl. Festival of Song) is an annual music competition in Albania organised by the national broadcaster Radio Televizioni Shqiptar (RTSH). It determines the country's representative for the Eurovision Song Contest and has been broadcasting almost every year since its inauguration in 1962. Various singing presentations have been used throughout its history, beginning with radio-only performances in the first few years, live interpretation, playback, remakes and even duets featuring other singers. The winners have traditionally been selected by a jury. However, other voting methods have also been applied, such as televoting or regional juries. At times, the head juror has carried twice the voting power of other jurors. Vaçe Zela holds the record for most victories in the competition with eleven wins followed by Tonin Tërshana with four wins and Aurela Gaçe and Manjola Nallbani with three wins respectively. The most recent winner is Arilena Ara who won the 58th edition of the contest. She will represent Albania in the Eurovision Song Contest 2020 in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.
