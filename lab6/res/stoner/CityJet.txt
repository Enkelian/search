History Early years Cityjet was founded in 1992 and commenced operations in January 1994 serving a single route between Dublin and London City Airport under a franchise agreement with Virgin Atlantic in which it paid fees and charges to Virgin in order to operate as "Virgin Cityjet" and use Virgin Atlantic' distribution channels. The airline was mainly competing with British Midland and Aer Lingus services from Dublin to London Heathrow and Ryanair services from Dublin to London Stansted. However, Cityjet held a monopoly on services to London City until Aer Lingus launches services from Dublin to London City as well in September 1999.In June 1995, Virgin Cityjet debuted with flights between Dublin and Brussels, competing with Sabena and Aer Lingus initially.In 1996, the airline terminated its franchise
