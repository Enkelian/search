Llano Estacado
The Llano Estacado (Spanish: [ˈʝano estaˈkaðo]), commonly known as the Staked Plains, is a region in the Southwestern United States that encompasses parts of eastern New Mexico and northwestern Texas. One of the largest mesas or tablelands on the North American continent, the elevation rises from 3,000 feet (900 m) in the southeast to over 5,000 feet (1,500 m) in the northwest, sloping almost uniformly at about 10 feet per mile (1.9 m/km). Naming The Spanish name Llano Estacado is often interpreted in English as "Staked Plains", but is more accurately rendered as "stockaded" or "palisaded plains". The name probably derives from the steep escarpments on the eastern, northern, and western periphery of the plains. Francisco Coronado and other European explorers described the Mescalero Ridge on the western boundary as resembling "palisades, ramparts, or stockades" of a fort.Other sources refer vaguely to "stakes" used to mark routes on the featureless plain, often meaning piles of stone, bone, and cow dung. Art Leatherwood comments in the Handbook of Texas that such way markers could plausibly explain the origin of the name, but that the "comparison of cliff formations and palisades made repeatedly by explorers argues more convincingly for the geological origin".
