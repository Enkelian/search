Vistry Group plc is a British housebuilding company based in Kings Hill, West Malling, Kent. Formerly Bovis Homes Group plc, it is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index. During the late 2010s, the quality of Bovis's housing was subject to customer complaints and threats of legal action. In January 2020, the group was renamed Vistry following the acquisition of housing businesses from Galliford Try, but was set to retain the Bovis Homes brand and the former Galliford Try brand, Linden Homes. History Bovis Homes Bovis Homes’ origins lay in the early post-war housing operations of Bovis Holdings (see also Bovis Construction). Bovis had been acquiring housing land in the early 1950s but the level of housebuilding was modest until 1967 when it acquired Frank Sanderson’s Malcolm Sanderson Developments and the much larger RT Warren. Frank Sanderson rapidly expanded Bovis’s housing through acquisition including the quoted Page-Johnson and Varney Holdings; by 1973 Bovis was probably the country’s second or third largest housebuilder, with sales of over 2,600.The secondary banking crisis adversely affected Bovis Holdings’ banking subsidiary and the Group had to be rescued by P&O in March 1974.
