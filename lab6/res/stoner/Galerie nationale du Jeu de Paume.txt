Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume
Jeu de Paume is an arts centre for modern and postmodern photography and media. It is located in the north corner (west side) of the Tuileries Gardens next to the Place de la Concorde in Paris. In 2004, Galerie Nationale du Jeu de Paume, Centre national de la photographie, and Patrimoine Photographique merged to form the Association Jeu de Paume. History The rectangular building was constructed in 1861 during the reign of Napoleon III as a complement to the already-existing Orangerie building. It was designed for jeu de paume, which nowadays is known as real tennis, court tennis or royal tennis. As tennis supplanted jeu de paume as a sport, the Jeu de Paume proved an inadequate space and was transformed into a gallery. When the Musée du Luxembourg opened its doors to foreign schools of painting at the end of the 19th century, the works it sponsored became important enough to require a separate exhibition space, and in 1909 the Jeu de Paume re-opened as a gallery with the “One hundred portraits of women from the 18th-century English and French Schools” exhibition. Operating first as an extension of the Louvre and Musée de l'Orangerie, it became an independent gallery
