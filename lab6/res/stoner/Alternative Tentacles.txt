Alternative Tentacles no longer owns the rights to Dead Kennedys recordings after a 2000 lawsuit. History Alternative Tentacles subsequently released records of other bands of the alternative/punk scene including releasing records (which were later released by other labels) by bands including The Dicks, 7 Seconds, and the Butthole Surfers. In 1981, Alternative Tentacles released the compilation Let Them Eat Jellybeans!.Some of the best known bands that have released albums through Alternative Tentacles are Dead Kennedys, NoMeansNo, D.O.A. and Alice Donut.In addition to musical acts, Alternative Tentacles also publishes spoken word albums, many by Jello Biafra himself.
