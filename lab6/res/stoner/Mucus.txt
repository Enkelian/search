Mucus
Mucus ( MEW-k…ôs) is a slippery aqueous secretion produced by, and covering, mucous membranes. It is typically produced from cells found in mucous glands, although it may also originate from mixed glands, which contain both serous and mucous cells. It is a viscous colloid containing inorganic salts, antimicrobial enzymes (such as lysozymes), immunoglobulins, and glycoproteins such as lactoferrin and mucins, which are produced by goblet cells in the mucous membranes and submucosal glands. Mucus serves to protect epithelial cells in the linings of the respiratory, digestive, and urogenital systems, and structures in the visual, and auditory systems from pathogenic fungi, bacteria and viruses. Most of the mucus in the body is produced in the gastrointestinal tract. Amphibians, fish, hagfish, snails, slugs, and some other invertebrates also produce external mucus from their epidermis as protection against pathogens, and to help in movement. Mucus is also produced in fish to line their gills. Plants produce a similar substance called mucilage that is also produced by some microorganisms. Respiratory system In the human respiratory system, mucus is part of the airway surface liquid (ASL) also known as the epithelial lining fluid (ELF), that lines most of the respiratory tract.
