Black Science
Black Science is the second studio album by heavy metal band GZR (for this album the band was known as Geezer). It was released on July 1, 1997 by TVT Records. The cover art for this album is intended to represent the Black Sabbath song "Hand of Doom". Geezer about the Doctor Who connection in the song "Among the Cybermen": "Yes, the lyrics were originally about the death of Doctor Who. The original chorus was "Doctor Who lies dead among the Cybermen", about the final battle of Dr. Who, but was supposed to be symbolic of the end of childhood. I changed it because I thought it sounded a bit silly. Most of the album is about growing up in the era of Sixties television, and its influence on me."
