Institute of International and European Affairs
The Institute of International and European Affairs (IIEA) (Irish: An Institiúid Gnóthaí Idirnáisiúnta agus Eorpacha) is an Irish policy think tank focusing on European and international policy trends based in Dublin, Ireland. It is known for its seminars and speaking events which attract notable international figures. It is a private charity. However, much of the IIEA's income comes from the Irish government and Irish state–owned entities and many of its leadership figures have Irish political or public service backgrounds. History The IIEA was founded as the Institute of European affairs in 1991. According to Tony Brown, author of a history of the IIEA, it was established to promote informed debate on European affairs in the wake of the Crotty Judgement and the subsequent Irish referendum on the Single European Act, which he argues was marked by low turnout for the time and limited and low-quality debate. The institute was officially launched in April 1991 by Minister for Foreign Affairs Gerry Collins. Brendan Halligan was head of the organising committee and its first chairman. Mary Robinson, then President of Ireland, was appointed as its patron.A June 1996 Irish Times article notes that the Institute of European Affairs (IEA) was set up
