North American Development Bank
The North American Development Bank (NADB) is a binational financial institution capitalized and governed equally by the Federal Governments of the United States of America and Mexico for the purpose of financing environmental projects certified by the Border Environment Cooperation Commission (BECC). The two institutions work together with communities and project sponsors in both countries to develop and finance infrastructure necessary for a clean and healthy environment for border residents. Established in 1994 with headquarters in San Antonio, Texas, its mission is to serve as a binational partner and catalyst in communities along the U.S.-Mexico border in order to enhance the affordability, financing, long-term development and effective operation of infrastructure that promotes a clean, healthy environment for the citizens of the region. The NADB provides financial assistance to public and private entities involved in developing environmental infrastructure projects in the border region. Potable water supply, sewage treatment and municipal solid waste management form the core sectors of the Bank’s activities and are its primary focus. However, assistance can also be provided in other areas—such as air quality, clean energy and hazardous waste—where sponsors are able to demonstrate tangible health and/or environmental benefits for residents living in the area.
