Russian submarine Kostroma (B-276)
B-276 Kostroma is a Russian Sierra-class submarine. She was launched in 1986, commissioned in 1987, and named K-276 Crab until 1992. Kostroma was built at Gorky and later towed to Severodvinsk for completion. She is part of the Russian Northern Fleet. On 11 February 1992, Kostroma - then still named K-276 Crab - collided with USS Baton Rouge (some sources state it was K-239 Carp that collided with Baton Rouge). Baton Rouge was damaged (as was Crab) and was eventually deactivated in 1993. The crew of K-276 Crab painted the number "1" bordered by a star on the sail, as did Soviet submarines during World War II to indicate the number of their victories.
