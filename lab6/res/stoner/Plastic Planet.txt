Plastic Planet
Plastic Planet is the debut studio album by GZR (known at the time as g//z/r), a heavy metal band featuring Geezer Butler of Black Sabbath. The album features Fear Factory vocalist Burton C. Bell. Album information Butler wrote the bulk of the album's lyrics, which he then gave to Bell who wrote melodies and music. An exception was "Cycle of Sixty", written by Howse. The song "Giving Up the Ghost" was lyrically directed at Tony Iommi and his continuation of the Black Sabbath name at the time. "Detective 27" indirectly references Batman whose first appearance in 1939 was in DC Comics' Detective Comics #27. The song "The Invisible" was featured on the soundtrack to the 1995 film Mortal Kombat, although the song did not appear in the film itself. The artist on the album was listed as "Geezer" instead of "g//z/r". Samples from the British TV movie The Woman in Black can be heard on "SÃ©ance Fiction". Although no commercial single was released, a CD promotional EP was issued by TVT Records in the USA (catalogue TVT 6014-2P), with full colour inserts. The track-list of this was 1) Cycle Of Sixty (radio mix) 2) X13 (radio mix) 3) Drive Boy
