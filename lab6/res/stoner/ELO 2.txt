ELO 2
ELO 2 is the eponymous second studio album by the Electric Light Orchestra (ELO), released in 1973. In the US, the album was released as Electric Light Orchestra II. It was also the last album to be released by the band under the Harvest label, the last where the band used the definite article The on its name and introduced their abbreviated name ELO. Background and recording The album was originally to be titled The Lost Planet, but that concept was quietly dropped (see below). During the initial recording sessions, Roy Wood left the band and formed Wizzard in June 1972. Although uncredited at the time, Wood performed on two tracks, playing cello and bass on "In Old England Town" and "From the Sun to the World". Classically trained cellist Colin Walker replaced Wood and Wilfred Gibson played violin. Richard Tandy made his ELO studio debut on this album, playing keyboards; he had earlier performed live with the original lineup alongside Wood, Lynne, drummer Bev Bevan, Gibson and cellist Mike Edwards, playing bass (and in TV appearances with The Move playing guitar). Bassist and vocalist Mike de Albuquerque also made his ELO studio debut on the album. All five pieces
