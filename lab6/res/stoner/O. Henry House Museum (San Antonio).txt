O. Henry House Museum (San Antonio)
The O. Henry House Museum is a historic house museum located in San Antonio, Texas. It is named for the American writer, William Sydney Porter, better known as O. Henry who lived in the house in 1885. History The O. Henry House museum was initially built by John Kush, a German settler in 1855. The house, built in adobe brick, was originally located at 904 South Presa street. In the early 1880s, William Sydney Porter, better known as O. Henry moved to San Antonio and rented the two room house for $6 a month. Porter lived here from 1885 to 1886. In 1959, the San Antonio Conservation Society, working with both the Lone Star Brewing Company and the descendants of John Kush, the original owner, purchased the home for a symbolic one dollar. This included the responsibility of moving the home within 60 days to save it from demolition. It was moved to the location of the Lone Star Brewing Company where it was part of the Buckhorn museum collection until the breweries closure in 1997. In 1998, David Carter and the MLP partnership moved the house once more, this time to its present location at the corner of Dolorosa
