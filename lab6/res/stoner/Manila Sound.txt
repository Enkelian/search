Manila Sound
Manila sound is a musical genre in the Philippines that began in the mid-1970s in Manila. The genre flourished and peaked in the mid- to late-1970s. It is often considered the "bright side" of the Philippine martial law era and has influenced most of the modern genres in the country by being the forerunner to OPM. History The Manila sound was popularized by the pop rock band Hotdog with their many hit singles, including "Ikaw ang Miss Universe ng Buhay Ko" (You Are the Miss Universe of My Life), "Panaginip" (Dream), "Langit Na Naman" (Heaven Once Again), "O, Lumapit Ka" (Oh, Come Closer), "Bitin Sa Iyo" (Left Hanging Over You), and "Dying to Tell You", among others. The name "Manila sound" may have been derived from Hotdog's hit single "Manila", which has come to epitomize this genre. Manila sound is characterized by catchy melodic phrases. In its later period, Manila sound was dominated by the disco mania that swept the Philippines, led by groups such as VST & Company, The Boyfriends and Hagibis, among others. Alternately described as "the marshmallow sound", Manila sound generated a string of calculated radio hits by artists such as Cinderella, VST & Co., Apolinario Mabini
