El Al
El Al Israel Airlines Ltd. (TASE: ELAL, אל על נתיבי אויר לישראל בע״מ), trading as El Al (Hebrew: אל על‎, "To the Skies" or "Skywards", stylized as ELעלALאל; Arabic: إل-عال‎) is the flag carrier of Israel. Since its inaugural flight from Geneva to Tel Aviv in September 1948, the airline has grown to serve over 50 destinations, operating scheduled domestic and international services and cargo flights within Israel, and to Europe, the Middle East, the Americas, Africa, Australia and the Far East, from its main base in Ben Gurion Airport. El Al is the only commercial airline to equip its planes with missile defense systems to protect its planes against surface-to-air missiles, and is considered one of the world's most secure airlines, thanks to its stringent security procedures, both on the ground and on board its aircraft. Although it has been the target of many attempted hijackings and terror attacks, only one El Al flight has ever been hijacked; that incident did not result in any fatalities.As Israel's national airline, El Al has played an important role in humanitarian rescue efforts, airlifting Jews from other countries to Israel, setting the world record for the most passengers on a commercial aircraft
