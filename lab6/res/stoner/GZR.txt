GZR
GZR was an American heavy metal band led by Black Sabbath bassist/lyricist Geezer Butler. The band has actually been marketed with three different names on their three releases. In 1995, the band was marketed as g//z/r. In 1997, it was merely geezer, and in 2005, it was GZR. Most fans refer to the band as Geezer, although Butler himself refers to the band name as "gee-zed-R." This incarnation of the band is not to be confused with Geezer's previous attempt in 1985 to form a solo band, then known as The Geezer Butler Band - the two bands are completely unrelated. The band's name is derived from the name of its creator: Terence "Geezer" Butler. Pedro Howse, the guitarist in the band, is Butler's nephew. Band history The music is generally of a much harder edge than Butler is known for in Black Sabbath. This is not a surprise, as the vocalist on his first album (Plastic Planet) was Burton C. Bell from Fear Factory, who is known for more driving and harder edged vocals than ever was displayed in Black Sabbath. Before taking on Bell as vocalist for Plastic Planet, Butler contacted Devin Townsend to perform on the album.
