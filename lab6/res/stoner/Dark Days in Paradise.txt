Dark Days in Paradise
Dark Days in Paradise is the eleventh solo studio album by Irish guitarist Gary Moore, released in 1997. Much like his earlier album Still Got the Blues, Dark Days in Paradise represented a stark change in musical direction for Moore, eschewing the electric blues style of his preceding albums in favour of a more contemporary sound.
