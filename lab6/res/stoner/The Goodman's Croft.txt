The Goodman's Croft
The Goodman's Croft was a superstition common in sixteenth-century Great Britain, particularly in Scotland. It was also known as Halyman's Croft, Goodman's Fauld, Gi'en Rig, Deevil's Craft, Clooties Craft, and the Black Faulie.It was condemned in 1594 by the General Assembly of the Reformed Kirk. They defined it as not labouring ane parcell of ground dedicate to the Devil, under the name of Goodman's Croft. The Kirk believed this to be a form of Satan worship, but suggestions have been made that these were more ancient offerings to general 'spirits'. Church forces labored to abolish the practice throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. == References ==
