We're Going Wrong
"We're Going Wrong" is a song by British supergroup Cream from the album Disraeli Gears. The song was written by bassist Jack Bruce and was the only song on Gears that Jack wrote without lyricist Pete Brown. Song structure With the song's lyrics being only two stanzas long, Jack Bruce's vocals are stretched out throughout the length of the song and are backed by Eric Clapton's psychedelic-style guitar work and Ginger Baker's drum beat which, at least when played live, uses Timpani drum mallets instead of regular drumsticks. The 6/8 time signature also gives the song a distinct and irregular sound. Bruce's vocals are falsetto and crooning-like and are accompanied with a slow bass line and a bluesy/psychedelic guitar melody; however Bakerâ€™s drumming is often frenetic and fast paced, making it completely at odds with the rest of the instruments. Live history Many of the tracks on Disraeli Gears, including "Sunshine of Your Love", were dropped from Cream's live set in late-1967 and replaced by longer tracks such as the rendition of "Spoonful" and Ginger Baker's instrumental "Toad". "We're Going Wrong", however, achieved occasional play time. Live album discography The following Cream live albums releases featured "We're Going Wrong": BBC
