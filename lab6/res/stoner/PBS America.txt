PBS America
PBS America is a British free-to-air television channel derived from the American public television broadcaster PBS. It is a joint venture between entrepreneur David Lyons and PBS Distribution, a joint venture of the broadcaster and the WGBH Educational Foundation which owns the international rights to the bulk of PBS's output.PBS America operates much like BBC Worldwide, a profit-making enterprise managed separately from the main non-profit, publicly financed arm, that will ideally generate money for its parent. It is provided by pay-television operators as part of their channel packages and carries advertising. Unlike PBS in the United States it does not solicit donations from viewers. Availability PBS America was launched on 1 November 2011 (as PBS UK) on Sky and Virgin Media. On 23 August 2011, PBS UK launched a placeholder channel called Rosa on Sky channel 231, however they were able to acquire the more prominent channel 166 EPG slot from Information TV for use from launch. On 28 October 2011, a barker channel for PBS UK was added to Virgin Media channel 243. The cable operator has also secured the rights to offer PBS content on its video on demand service, including the Virgin Media Player.On 19 April 2012,
