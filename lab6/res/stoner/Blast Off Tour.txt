Blast Off Tour
The Blast Off Tour 2013 was a 2013 Europe-only single-leg tour by Blondie to promote their upcoming album Ghosts of Download. It visited venues across the UK and Ireland, as well as a single stop in Moscow and appearances at four festivals in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and the Isle of Man. Several of the shows were marketed under the 'Forest Live' brand, as Blondie performed their Blast Off Tour at forests across the UK as part of an arrangement with the Forestry Commission. Background The tour was announced in Summer-Autumn 2012, with tickets going on sale in January 2013. The Forest Live shows were the first to be announced. The tour was to promote the group's upcoming album Ghosts of Download and so seven songs from the album were featured in the setlist, including Blondie's version of Frankie Goes to Hollywood hit "Relax". Rehearsals for the tour were held from June 2–11, 2013 in New Jersey at an undisclosed location.
