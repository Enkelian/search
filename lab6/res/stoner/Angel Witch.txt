Angel Witch
Angel Witch are a British heavy metal band which formed in London, England in 1976 as part of the new wave of British heavy metal movement. They are well known for having inspired Lars Ulrich to form Metallica. Biography The band was formed, originally under the name of Lucifer, and was initially composed of guitarist and vocalist Kevin Heybourne, guitarist Rob Downing, drummer Steve Jones, and bassist Barry Clements. Lucifer split and Steve Jones joined up with Bruce Dickinson to form Speed. The remnants of Lucifer became Angel Witch, with the exceptions of Barry, who was replaced by Kevin Riddles, and Steve Jones, who was replaced by Dave Hogg. The following year Rob Downing left the band. Angel Witch's first song to achieve mainstream popularity was "Baphomet", which was included on a compilation titled Metal for Muthas. This song drew a fair amount of attention to the band, and they eventually signed a recording deal with EMI. However, the deal was soon canceled, due to manager Ken Heybourne refusing to hand Angel Witch over to professional management, and performance of their first single released under the EMI label in 1980, which was entitled Sweet Danger and lasted a single week
