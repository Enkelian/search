Since about 1970, California has been experiencing an extended and increasing housing shortage,:3 such that by 2018, California ranked 49th among the United States in housing units per resident.:1 This shortage has been estimated to be 3-4 million housing units (20-30% of California's housing stock, 14 million as of 2017). Experts say that California needs to double its current rate of housing production (85,000 units per year) to keep up with expected population growth and prevent prices from further increasing, and needs to quadruple the current rate of housing production over the next 7 years in order for prices and rents to decline.The cause is the imbalance between supply and demand; the result of strong economic growth creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs (which increases demand for housing) and the insufficient construction of new housing units to provide enough supply to meet the demand.
