Neurophysins
Neurophysins are carrier proteins which transport the hormones oxytocin and vasopressin to the posterior pituitary from the paraventricular and supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus, respectively. Inside the neurosecretory granules, the analogous neurophysin I and II form stabilizing complexes via covalent interactions. Stabilizing neurophysin-hormone complexes that are formed within neurosecretory granules located in the posterior pituitary gland aid in intra-axonal transport. During intra-axonal transport, the neurophysin's are believed to prevent the bound hormone from leaking into the cytoplasmic space and proteolytic digestion via enzymes. However, due to the low concentration of neurophysin in the blood, it's likely the protein-hormone complex dissociates, indicating the neurophysin does not aid in transporting the hormone through the circulatory system . Neurophysins are also secreted out of the posterior pituitary hypothalamus, each carrying their respective associated passenger hormone. When the posterior pituitary hypothalamus secretes vasopressin and its neurophysin carrier, it also secretes a glycopeptide. There are two types: Neurophysin I - Oxytocin Neurophysin II - Vasopressin (Also known as "antidiuretic hormone" or ADH) Biosynthesis of Neurophysins These proteins are synthesized in the cell bodies of the supraoptic and paraventricular regions of the hypothalamus. The disulfide-rich neurophysin protein is suggested to be congruent with the synthesis of
