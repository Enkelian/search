Biography Childhood and early life Growing up in Sydney, Mozgawa was raised by her Polish parents, who had moved from Poland to Australia to perform music together as a musical duo.At age 13, Mozgawa began playing the drums, and was initially influenced by the drummer Zac Hanson from the pop band Hanson. She explained: "For a lot of people who are a half-generation older than me it was Tommy Lee, but for me it was Zac Hanson from Hanson. I'm probably in a smaller group of people who were really turned on to the profession by that particular man". At age 14, Mozgawa pretended to be a "20-year-old Polish immigrant with no ID" to perform at Sydney music venues. Mozgawa befriended Red Hot Chili Peppers bass guitarist Flea, who suggested she move to Los Angeles, eventually meeting the members of Warpaint. With Warpaint
