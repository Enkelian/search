Sulfur dichloride
Sulfur dichloride is the chemical compound with the formula SCl2. This cherry-red liquid is the simplest sulfur chloride and one of the most common. It is used as a precursor to organosulfur compounds. Chlorination of sulfur SCl2 is produced by the chlorination of either elemental sulfur or disulfur dichloride. The process occurs in a series of steps, some of which are: S8 + 4 Cl2 → 4 S2Cl2; ΔH = −58.2 kJ/mol S2Cl2 + Cl2 ↔ 2 SCl2; ΔH = −40.6 kJ/molThe addition of Cl2 to S2Cl2 has been proposed to proceed via a mixed valence intermediate Cl3S-SCl. SCl2 undergoes even further chlorination to give SCl4, but this species is unstable at near room temperature. It is likely that several SxCl2 exist where x > 2. Disulfur dichloride, S2Cl2, is the most common impurity in SCl2. Separation of SCl2 from S2Cl2 is possible via distillation with PCl3 to form an azeotrope of 99% purity, however sulfur dichloride loses chlorine slowly at room temperature and reverts to disulfur dichloride. Pure samples may be stored in sealed glass ampules which develop a slight positive pressure of chlorine, halting the decomposition. Use of SCl2 in chemical synthesis SCl2 is used In organic synthesis.
