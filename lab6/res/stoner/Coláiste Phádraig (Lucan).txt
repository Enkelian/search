Coláiste Phádraig (Lucan)
Coláiste Phádraig (St.Patrick's College) is a Christian Brothers secondary school for boys in Lucan, County Dublin, Ireland. It is located in an estate called Roselawn with a relatively large campus that includes three basketball courts, two football pitches, a large school building and a modern sports hall which includes a school gym. Coláiste Phádraig is part of the Edmund Rice Trust schools. History The school opened in September 1969, and in its infancy was composed of merely two teachers and forty-five students. Initial lessons were taught in just one prefab. During the 1970s, in order to accommodate the increasing student population, more prefabs were added, until a new school building was commissioned, ultimately opening in 1978. Further growth and development occurred, resulting in an increase in the staff size of the school to thirty by the turn of the decade. However, with a spiking population in Lucan, the existing school building was no longer of a sufficient size, and thus a large extension was built in 2004 to expand the footprint of the school. The extension contained computer and science labs and a careers library in addition to new metalwork and woodwork rooms and a gym were also added. As
