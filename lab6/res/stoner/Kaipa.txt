Kaipa
Kaipa is a Swedish progressive rock musical group. History The band was begun as Ura Kaipa by Hans Lundin (keyboards) and Tomas Eriksson (bass). Roine Stolt joined Kaipa as guitarist when he was 17. In 1974, shortly after they had cut the "Ura" from the name of the band, they released their self-titled debut album. Stolt, who later founded The Flower Kings, quit after the recording of Mindrevolutions, and the band has continued without him. In 2014, original members Roine Stolt, Ingemar Bergman, and Tomas Eriksson re-grouped under the name Kaipa DaCapo to play the old music from the first three albums as well as brand new music. New members of the band are Mikael Stolt, brother of Roine, on vocals and guitar, and renowned Swedish musician Max Lorentz on keyboards. Recording of a new album began in June 2016 with a scheduled release in September and an extended European and Scandinavian tour in the autumn.
