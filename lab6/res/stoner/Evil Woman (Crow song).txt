"Evil Woman" (sometimes titled "Evil Woman Don't Play Your Games with Me") is a song by Minneapolis-based band Crow, on their 1969 album Crow Music. It reached number 19 on the US Billboard Hot 100 pop chart. Cover versions Black Sabbath version It was covered in 1970 by Black Sabbath and, as "Evil Woman", released as their first single. The song also appeared on the band's debut album, Black Sabbath, for the European edition later that year. "The Crow original is more uptempo than Sabbath's rendering," observed Sabbath fanzine editor Peter Scott. "The song comes across a lot happier and the vocals are delivered in a stronger, less morbid vein… The whole middle section solo is done with a trumpet – something which definitely would not have fitted into the context of Black Sabbath, the band or LP."Despite being Sabbath's first single, "Evil Woman" was excluded from their debut album in the United States, being replaced by its B-side "Wicked World". It was first officially released in the US in 2002, on the compilation Symptom of the Universe: The Original Black Sabbath 1970–1978 and later on the following compilation "Black Sabbath: The Ultimate Collection" released in 2016.
