Stage name
A stage name is a pseudonym used by performers and entertainers, such as actors, comedians, singers and musicians. Such titles are adopted for a wide variety of reasons and may be similar or nearly identical to an individual's birth name. In some situations, a performer will eventually adopt their title as a legal name, although this is often not the case. Nicknames are sometimes used as part of a person's professional name. Motivation to use a stage name A performer will often take a stage name because their real name is considered unattractive, dull, or unintentionally amusing, is difficult to pronounce or spell, has been used by another notable individual, or projects an undesired image. Sometimes a performer adopts a name which is unusual or outlandish to attract attention. Other performers use a stage name in order to retain anonymity. The equivalent concept among writers is called a nom de plume or pen name. In radio, the term "radio name" or "air name" is used. Family connection Some individuals who are related to a celebrity take a different last name so they are not perceived to have received undue advantage from their family connection.
