Garden of Eden (Guns N' Roses song)
"Garden of Eden" is a song by American hard rock band Guns N' Roses (written by Axl Rose and Slash), which appears on the album Use Your Illusion I. According to Slash, the song was written while the band was rehearsing for an extended period of time in Chicago.There is a music video of the song, which consists of one continuous shot which features a close-up of Rose with the band playing in the background, whilst keyboardist Dizzy Reed and Teddy Andreadis (who played the harmonica for the band during the Use Your Illusion Tour) are seen dancing in the background. There are two versions of the video, both made in 1992, one has paper flying through the air (this is the one mostly found on music video sites like Yahoo Music). The other version has lyrics, complete with a "follow-the-bouncing-ball", but with no paper flying around. This is the version that is on the Guns N' Roses music video compilation Welcome to the Videos. This video was used as music video fodder for the MTV re-airing of the pilot episode of Beavis and Butthead. Additionally, Rolling Stone ranked it 7th best out of 17 in its ranking of Guns
