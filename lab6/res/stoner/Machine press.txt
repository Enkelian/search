A forming press, commonly shortened to press, is a machine tool that changes the shape of a workpiece by the application of pressure. The operator of a forming press is known as a press-tool setter, often shortened to toolsetter. Presses can be classified according to their mechanism: hydraulic, mechanical, pneumatic; their function: forging presses, stamping presses, press brakes, punch press, etc. their structure, e.g. Knuckle-joint press, screw press their controllability: conventional vs. servo-presses Shop Press Typically consisting of a simple rectangular frame, often fabricated from C-channel or tubing, containing a bottle jack or hydraulic cylinder to apply pressure via a ram to a workpiece. Often used for general-purpose forming work in the auto mechanic shop, machine shop, garage or basement shops, etc. Typical shop presses are capable of applying between 1 and 30 tons pressure, depending on size and construction. Lighter-duty versions are often called arbor presses. A shop press is commonly used to press interference fit parts together, such as gears onto shafts or bearings into housings.
