Universal Music TV (UMTV) is a London-based record label formed in 1998, and owned by Universal Music Group. UMTV specialises in producing compilation albums and occasional single releases.

Joint venture compilations include Clubland, the Kiss Presents series, Kerrang!, MTV Unplugged, Floorfillers, Steve Wright Sunday Love Songs, Virgin Radio, Dreamboats & Petticoats, Capital Gold and the Motown albums. UMTV has also run catalogue campaigns including The Shadows, Status Quo, Tony Christie, Barry White, Sam Cooke and Engelbert Humperdinck. A small number of individual artists were signed or transferred to this label in the early 2000s, including Malachi Cush, Alistair Griffin and Sam and Mark. None of these currently retain their contract. In 2007, UMTV launched the Universal Music Record Label (UMRL). In 2010, UMRL released albums from Simple Minds and A-ha.
