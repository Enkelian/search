Mission College (California)
Mission College (Mission) is a public community college in Santa Clara, California. It is part of the West Valley–Mission Community College District. The land the college is on was bought between 1966 and 1967. Mission College opened for it first year from 1979-1980 with "3,500 students, 8 administrators, and 73 instructors". History The Mission College Interim Campus was housed on the site of the vacant Jefferson Middle School at the corner of Monroe Street and Lawrence Express in Santa Clara, California in early September, 1975. From this humble beginning, three members originally appointed for full-time duty—Teri Chiang (Mathematics), Don Joslen (Fine Arts), and Son Le (Philosophy)) worked with Administrator Burt Hermosillo with the support of several part-time faculty volunteers from West Valley College to offer morning and evening classes. By summer, 1976, the Governing Board had appointed Warren Sorenson as founding president. Mission College's first Commencement took place in June, 1977 with the President of Santa Clara University as Commencement Speaker. Notably, among a handful of graduates for Mission College Class '77 was Eddie Sousa who was later elected Mayor of Santa Clara. The birth of Mission College seemed uneventful; its full development was not, however. Reported disputes over noise
