The New World is one of the names used for the majority of Earth's Western Hemisphere, specifically the Americas (including nearby islands).

Afro-Eurasia). The phrase gained prominence after the publication of a pamphlet titled Mundus Novus attributed to Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci. The Americas were also referred to as the "fourth part of the world".

For lack of alternatives, the term is also still useful to those discussing issues that concern the Americas and the nearby oceanic islands, such as Bermuda and
