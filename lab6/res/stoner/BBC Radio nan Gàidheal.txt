BBC Radio nan Gàidheal is a Scottish radio station, broadcasting in Scottish Gaelic. It is operated by the BBC as part of its portfolio of television and radio services in Scotland. The station is available from FM transmitters throughout Scotland: its service licence states that "BBC Radio nan Gàidheal should be available every day for general reception across Scotland on FM"; it can also be heard on digital television platforms, DAB Digital Radio, and online. BBC Radio nan Gàidheal programmes are also broadcast (with an in-vision graphical overlay) on the Scottish Gaelic digital television channel BBC Alba during periods when the channel is not carrying television programmes. History Scottish Gaelic-language programming has been transmitted in Scotland since 1923, and the BBC's Gaelic-language department was established in 1935. Launching on 17 May 1976, BBC Radio Highland produced a range of Gaelic programming – BBC Radio na Gaidhealtachd – and on 5 October 1979 the Scottish Gaelic service BBC Radio nan Eilean was established in Stornoway. On 1 October 1985, these two separate services united to form Radio nan Gàidheal. The main base for Radio nan Gaidheal is on Seaforth Road in Stornoway, having moved in June 2014 from the Church Street
