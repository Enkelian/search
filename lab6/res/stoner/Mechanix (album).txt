Mechanix (album)
Mechanix is the tenth studio album by the British hard rock band UFO; it was released in 1982. The contemporary music-press adverts on the album's release carried the tag-line 'Mechanix: it will tighten your nuts'. Immediately after the completion of the tour in support of the album, founding member and bassist Pete Way left the band to join former Motörhead guitarist "Fast" Eddie Clarke in Fastway. It was reissued in 1994 on Repertoire Records. The album was also reissued in 2009, remastered with an expanded booklet and bonus tracks.
