A product of hometown's Sporting de Gijón youth academy, he was not very successful in his first stint with the club (only 11 first-team appearances in his first three seasons combined) but, after a loan spell with RCD Mallorca in the second division in the 1996–97 campaign, with promotion, he returned as a full member of the main squad, but Sporting were relegated from La Liga in his first year back.Having attracted attention from Deportivo de La Coruña in 1999 and subsequently purchased for €300.000, Manuel would then begin a series of loan spells in the first and second levels, adding to this a very short experience with Germany's Hannover 96 in the Bundesliga (also on loan, alongside compatriots – in the same situation – Fernando and Jaime).Finally released in June 2003 he resumed his career mainly in division three, retiring well into his 30s. During this timeframe he played mainly for CD Roquetas, in the third but also in the fourth divisions. References External links José Manuel
