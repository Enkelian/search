Abu'l-Khattar al-Husam ibn Darar al-Kalbi (Arabic: أبو الخطار الحسام بن ضرار الكلبي‎) was Umayyad governor of Al-Andalus from May 743 until August 745. He was succeeded by Tuwaba ibn Salama al-Gudami. He was taken prisoner by the Ma'addites at the Battle of Secunda in 747 whilst trying to re-assert his right to rule against the challenge of Yusuf ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri.
