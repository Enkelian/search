MV Norsel (1945)
MV Norsel was a Norwegian sealing ship home ported in Tromsø. Launched during the final weeks of the Second World War as Lyngdalsfjord and only completed in late 1949, the ship sailed in both Arctic and Antarctic waters for more than 53 years until shipwrecking off the coast of Norway in 1992. Description The 592 GRT vessel was built by Kaldnes Mekaniske Verksted in Tønsberg, Norway. She had yard number 122, and was 50.3 metres (165 ft) long overall, with a beam of 9 metres (30 ft). Her length between perpendiculars was 45 metres (148 ft). Originally intended to be powered by a steam engine, the vessel, when completed, instead had a single 1,080 horsepower MAN 6-cylinder diesel engine. In addition to the main engine, Norsel had a 35-horsepower auxiliary engine.The ship was rebuilt at Tromsø Shipyard in 1966, having her superstructure and internal fittings replaced. Four years later, in 1970, the ship's engine was replaced with a 1,200 horsepower engine from Maschinenbau Kiel (MaK). In 1979, the ship's engine was replaced yet again, this time with a 3,000 horsepower MaK, making Norsel Norway's most powerful icebreaker. During the 1970s, Norsel was rebuilt as a shell trawler and purse seiner,
