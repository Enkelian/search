Bad Luck Streak in Dancing School
Bad Luck Streak in Dancing School is the fourth studio album by American singer-songwriter Warren Zevon. The album was released on February 15, 1980, by Elektra Records. Three singles were released from the album, one of which charted: "A Certain Girl" (a cover of a song previously recorded by Ernie K-Doe and The Yardbirds) reached No. 57 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was Zevon's second and final hit on that chart. "Play It All Night Long" is a bracing take on the presumed bleak realities of white southern rural poverty, or “country living.” Its sardonic reference to Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Sweet Home Alabama" in the chorus signals that Skynyrd’s glorification of southern life is the target of Zevon’s dark caricature, while also suggesting that such music can bring some degree of escape, if not transcendence, to an otherwise intolerable existence.The term "dancing school" has been used as a euphemism for a brothel since the mid-17th century.The album was dedicated to Ken Millar (1915–1983), a friend of Zevon's who was better known for writing mystery novels under the name Ross Macdonald.
