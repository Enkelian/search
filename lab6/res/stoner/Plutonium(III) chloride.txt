Plutonium(III) chloride
Plutonium(III) chloride is the chemical compound with the formula PuCl3. It can be prepared by dissolving the metal in hydrochloric acid. Structure Plutonium atoms in crystalline PuCl3 are 9 coordinate, and the structure is tricapped trigonal prismatic. Safety As with all plutonium compounds, it is subject to control under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Due to the radioactivity of plutonium, all of its compounds, PuCl3 included, are warm to the touch. Such contact is not recommended, since touching the material may result in serious injury. == References ==
