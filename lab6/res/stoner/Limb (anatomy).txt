Limb (anatomy)
A limb (from the Old English lim), or extremity, is a jointed, or prehensile, appendage of the human or other animal body. In the human body, the arms and the legs are commonly called the upper limbs and lower limbs respectively, to include part of the shoulder and hip girdles. Arms and legs are connected to torso or trunk. Many animals use limbs for locomotion, such as walking, running, or climbing. Some animals can use their forelimbs (which are homologous to arms in humans) to carry and manipulate objects. Some animals can also use hind limbs for manipulation. Human legs and feet are specialized for two-legged locomotion â€“ most other mammals walk and run on all four limbs. Human arms are weaker, but very mobile allowing us to reach at a wide range of distances and angles, and end in specialized hands capable of grasping and fine manipulation of objects. Though human dexterity is relatively unique, grasping behavior is widespread among tetrapods. Terminology The overall patterns of the forelimbs and hindlimbs are so similar ancestrally, and branch out in similar ways; that they are given shared names. Limbs are attached to the pectoral girdle or pelvic girdle. The one bony
