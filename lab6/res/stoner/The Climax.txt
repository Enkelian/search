The Climax
The Climax is a horror film produced by Universal Pictures, first released in the United States in 1944. The credits state this is based on the play of the same name by Edward Locke, although the plot has little connection to Locke's play. Originally intended to be a sequel to Universal's remake version of Phantom of the Opera (1943), it featured new characters and a new plot. Susanna Foster was the only member of the cast to star in the new film.
