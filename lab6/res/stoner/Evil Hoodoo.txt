Evil Hoodoo
Evil Hoodoo is a compilation album by the American garage rock band the Seeds, and was released by Bam-Caruso Records, in 1988. Somewhat relatable to a greatest hits album, Evil Hoodoo did not issue any unreleased tracks by the group; however, it did introduce listeners to the Seeds' music as underground psychedelic rock and garage rock musical genres were being rediscovered.The album focuses on the Seeds' garage rock and proto-punk releases, completely bypassing their flirtation with the blues on the group's fourth studio album A Full Spoon of Seedy Blues. Nationally charting hits featured on Evil Hoodoo includes "Pushin' Too Hard" (number 36), "Can't Seem to Make You Mine" (number 41), and "Mr. Farmer" (number 86). Perhaps the rarest recordings on the album are "Fallin' Off the Edge (Of My Mind)" and "Chocolate River", both of which received their first LP release on the 1977 compilation Fallin' Off the Edge. "Fallin' Off the Edge (Of My Mind)" is a 1969 single release, and "Chocolate River" was recorded during the A Web of Sound sessions, but never appeared on the album.Released in 1988, Evil Hoodoo helped revitalize the Seeds' music, as young collectors began discovering once-obscured psychedelic and garage rock musical
