Hear 'n Aid
Hear 'n Aid was a charity record recorded by a large ensemble of 40 heavy metal musicians, and released in 1986. The project was organized by Ronnie James Dio, Jimmy Bain, and Vivian Campbell, all from the band Dio. Proceeds from the album were used to raise money for famine relief in Africa.The 40 musicians which had been gathered together by Dio recorded the single "Stars" together; the rest of the album was filled out with eight other tracks, several of which were contributed by artists who were on tour and unable to attend and participate in the mass recording session. A music video was released as well, produced during the recording sessions. Release and reception Dio had originally intended the single and album to be released shortly after its recording, but contractual issues with the different artists' record labels delayed the release until January 1, 1986, somewhat diminishing the impact of its release. The compilation album titled "Hear 'n Aid" or alternatively appearing as "Hear 'n Aid (An All-Star Album For Famine Relief)" was headed by "Stars", and included live tracks by Kiss, Mot√∂rhead, Dio, Accept, Rush, Scorpions, Y&T and a studio recording by Jimi Hendrix was released on
