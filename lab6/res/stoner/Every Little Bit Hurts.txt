Every Little Bit Hurts
"Every Little Bit Hurts" was originally a 1964 hit single for Motown soul singer Brenda Holloway, written by Ed Cobb.Though she was against recording the song again (she recorded it a couple of years before signing with Motown), she reluctantly recorded the song and the label released it in the summer of the year. Becoming a big hit peaking at No. 13 on the Billboard Hot 100, the song would become one of Holloway's trademark singles and would spark remakes by acts like Small Faces and the Spencer Davis Group (with lead vocals by Steve Winwood). Covers The Spencer Davis Group version reached #41 in the UK and #9 in Canada in early 1965. Released in October 1976, it was covered by Graeme "Shirley" Strachan (lead singer of Skyhooks) as his debut solo release and peaked at No. 3 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Charts. Teena Marie recorded the song for her 1979 Motown Records debut Wild and Peaceful however it remained unreleased until the 1994 compilation I Need Your Lovin': The Very Best Of Teena Marie.
