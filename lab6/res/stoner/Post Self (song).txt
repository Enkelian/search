Post Self (song)
"Post Self" is an industrial metal song by the band Godflesh, taken from their 2017 album of the same name. It was released ahead of Post Self on 31 October 2017 through frontman Justin Broadrick's own label, Avalanche Recordings, as a digital download. Composition "Post Self", the introductory and title track of Godflesh's eighth studio album, is one of only a few songs on the release to feature a traditional metal riff. Structurally, "Post Self" can be seen as a microcosm of its host album; just as Post Self begins with a three metal-oriented tracks, "Post Self" the song's first half is dominated by aggressive guitar and guttural vocals, and just as Post Self becomes more somber and experimental in its latter stages, so too does the song. Peter Helman of Stereogum described the song as "crushing", and Zoe Camp of Revolver called it "relentless". Noisey's Phil Witmer highlighted the song's distortion, hip hop-inspired percussion, screaming, low-tuned guitar and overall grinding sound as "a great primer" for the band. Some critics labeled the song as post-punk. Critical reception "Post Self" was well received by critics. AllMusic writer Paul Simpson called the main riff "instantly striking."
