Deep Tracks
Deep Tracks is a Sirius XM Radio channel featuring lesser-known classic rock music selections such as album tracks, one-hit wonders, concert recordings, "forgotten 45s" and "B-side" tracks. Brian Beddow is Deep Tracks' current programming director. Earle Bailey is one of its on-air (and very deep) voices and has worked with American voice-over artist Ted Williams. Meg Griffin and Jim Ladd (with his themed sets programming) are also heard regularly on the channel during the week, with Dusty Street and Carol Miller appearing on weekends. The original programmer for the channel, George Taylor Morris, departed in the summer of 2008 due to health issues. The station appears as channel 27 on Sirius XM Radio. It replaced The Vault as a part of the Sirius/XM merger in 2008. It can also be heard on Dish Network channel 6027(previously 6016) until Sirius XM's The Blend took Sirius XM Radio 16 and Dish Network 6016. As of April 2009, this channel has changed its logo, taking the logo from former XM channel Top Tracks, which was replaced by Classic Vinyl post-Sirius/XM merger. The name is a remnant of XM's old classic rock stations: Big Tracks, Top Tracks, and Deep Tracks. Big Tracks became Classic
