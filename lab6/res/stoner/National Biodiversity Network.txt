National Biodiversity Network
The National Biodiversity Network (UK) (NBN) is a collaborative venture set up in 2000 in the United Kingdom committed to making biodiversity information available through various media, including on the internet via the NBN Atlas—the data search website of the NBN. Description It is estimated that up to 60,000 people routinely record biodiversity information in the UK and Ireland. Most of this effort is voluntary and is organised through about 2,000 national societies and recording schemes. The UK government through its agencies also collects biodiversity data and one of the principal elements for the collation and interpretation of this data is the network of Local (Biological) Records Centres.In 2012, it had been listed in the top 1,000 UK charities that raised most donations. NBN Trust The NBN Trust—the organisation facilitating the building of the Network—supports agreed standards for the collection, collation and exchange of biodiversity data and encourages improved access. The present partnership consists of over 170 public and voluntary organisations and individual members. The NBN Atlas currently holds over 222 million records from approximately 800 different datasets (March 2019). Data on the NBN Atlas can be accessed by anyone interested in UK, Ireland and Isle of Man wildlife and
