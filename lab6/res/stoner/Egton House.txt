Egton House
Egton House in Langham Street in Central London was home to BBC Radio 1 for many years from 1985 until 1996. Radio 1 moved to Yalding House on Great Portland Street in 1996, and Egton House was demolished in 2003 to make way for the new John Peel Wing of BBC Broadcasting House. Jo Whiley was the last presenter to broadcast from Egton House (12pm-2pm on Weds 9 October 1996).Egton House was also home to the BBC Gramophone Library, a collection of over one million records and CDs. The 78 rpm collection was held in the basement of The Langham which is across the road and has now reverted to being a luxury hotel. References External links Egton House information at Radio Rewind
