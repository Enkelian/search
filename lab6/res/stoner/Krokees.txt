In the Bronze Age, Krokees was inhabited by the Achaean and Pelasgian tribes. Later, around 1100 BC, with the rest of Laconia, the town was taken over by the Dorians. In antiquity, Krokees was famous for its beautiful forest green volcanic stone with green and golden spots (Porphyry) known as "Krokeatis lithos" (Krokean stone).
