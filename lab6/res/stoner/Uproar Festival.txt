Uproar Festival
The Uproar Festival, also called the Rockstar Energy Drink Uproar Festival, was an annual hard rock and heavy metal tour inaugurated in 2010 by John Reese and sponsored by Rockstar Energy Drink. The tour was also created by John Oakes, Darryl Eaton and Ryan Harlacher from the Creative Artists Agency, and Perry Lavoisne from Live Nation. Reese is also responsible for creating Mayhem Festival and the Taste of Chaos tour. Uproar Festival is the replacement for Reese's Taste of Chaos tour, as he was "running out of bands that fit within the profile of what Taste of Chaos was."John Reese attempted to have Pantera as headliner for a 2015 show, but those plans fell through. Reese said that for the first time since 2010 the festival would not take place in 2015 or 2016. 2010 line-up Main StageDisturbed Avenged Sevenfold Stone Sour HalestormJägermeister StageHellyeah Airbourne Hail the Villain New Medicine White Cowbell Oklahoma (for all Canadian dates) Jägermeister Battle of the Bands Winner 2010 tour dates 2011 line-up Main StageAvenged Sevenfold Three Days Grace Seether Bullet for My Valentine Escape the FateBest Buy Music Gear StageSevendust Black Tide Art of Dying Hell or Highwater Fozzy (Selected Dates) Battle of the
