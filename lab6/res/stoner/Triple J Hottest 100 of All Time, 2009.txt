Triple J Hottest 100 of All Time, 2009
The Triple J Hottest 100 of All Time was a music poll conducted in 2009 amongst listeners of Australian youth radio network Triple J. Over half a million votes were compiled, with Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit" collecting the highest number of votes. Voters could submit a list of up to ten different songs as well as nominating one of these as their "all-time" favourite song. It was the fifth such poll organised by Triple J, following similar polls in 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1998. Initially, all songs were eligible for the annual Triple J Hottest 100. However, from 1993 onward (after having no list in 1992), only songs released in the previous year were permitted. Thus, the Hottest 100 of All Time is conducted via a separate vote, held irregularly to reflect listeners' favourite songs across all eras. The 2009 list was designed to reflect the twentieth anniversary of the Hottest 100's inception. The Triple J Hottest 100 of all time was broadcast over two nights on ABC TV's music show Rage. However, certain songs were omitted from the broadcast because they were never made into music videos. Full list Bold: Previous winner of a standard Hottest 100 Green
