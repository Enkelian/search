Beachbuggy
Beachbuggy were a British rock group formed in early 1992 in Doncaster by Jack Straker (guitar/vocals), Jim VeVee (drums) and A.D (bass). The band's name reflected singer and main songwriter Jack's obsession with classic cars, drag racing and Americana. Musically, their earliest influences were UK indie bands such as The Fall, The Wedding Present and Cud and American rock groups such as Buffalo Tom and Sonic Youth. Early history Beachbuggy's first recordings were released as a three-track demo tape within weeks of the band forming in mid-1992 and were sold at early gigs, which took place throughout South Yorkshire and occasionally further afield. One of their biggest early gigs was at a special one-off show in Doncaster where headliners, Leeds band The Wedding Present, filmed a promo video for one of their 1992 'Hit parade' singles. This gig forged a link between the two bands which was to continue throughout the 1990s and beyond. Shortly after the release of their first demo tape A.D left to be replaced by Paul Maan - the first of many line-up changes. The new line-up signalled a decisive change in musical policy - early songs are dropped and a more retro, rock 'n' roll
