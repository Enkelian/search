Visiting the sick
Visiting the sick, either at hospital or their home, is a recommended philanthropic deed in different cultures and religions, including Christianity, Judaism and Islam and is considered an aspect of benevolence and a work of mercy. In Judaism, for instance, the act is called Bikur cholim and is considered a part of mitzvah (commandment). Format Visiting the sick is mainly performed on a voluntarily basis. The purpose of the visit is to reflect on shared feeling with the sick person and to spend some warm quality time with them, providing him/her with inspiration and positive feelings that can help them fight their sickness and get well soon . == References ==
