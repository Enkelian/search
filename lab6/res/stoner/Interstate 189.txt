Interstate 189
Interstate 189 (I-189) is an auxiliary Interstate Highway in Chittenden County, Vermont, United States. The highway extends for 1.488 miles (2.395 km) from Interstate 89 exit 13 in South Burlington to US Route 7 at the Burlington city limit. I-189 is the only spur on the entire length of I-89. Route description I-189 serves as an Interstate-grade connector between I-89 and a commercial district along US 7 (Shelburne Road). It is signed as an eastâ€“west highway. Prior to 2010, only one directional sign had been posted on the highway - on the eastbound side after the on-ramp from US 7. Sign replacements and additions in late 2010 added directional signs on both the eastbound and westbound sides of the route.

The roadway was abandoned just beyond the US 7 interchange. As a result, Jersey barriers are in place on I-189 west directing traffic onto
