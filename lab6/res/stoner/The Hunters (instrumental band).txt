The Hunters (instrumental band)
The Hunters were a British instrumental band from the late 1950s to early 1960s. From 1964 till 1967 there was also a Dutch rock band with the name "The Hunters", with lead guitar player Jan Akkerman. Originating from the Cheshunt area of Hertfordshire and formed from the remnants of The Parker Royal Five, The Hunters found work as a backing group for touring US stars such as Bobby Rydell, Jimmy Jones in the UK, and British-based artists The Allisons, Frank Ifield, The Avons, Mark Wynter, Kenny Lynch and Michael Cox. Their first major hit was "Sweet Dreams" on the Columbia label as the backing band to singer Dave Sampson, which reached No. 29 in May 1960. Sampson had written the song whilst at the Curry Bazaar Indian Restaurant in Wardour Street, London West End in October 1959 with friend and neighbour Cliff Richard in mind but record producer Norrie Paramor thought that the song would suit Sampson more. They followed up with a release of their first track "Teen Scene" on the Fontana label in the same year, although it did not actually chart. Further releases followed backing Dave Sampson and also without him as instrumentalists in a dual career
