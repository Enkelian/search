Success (magazine)
Success is a business magazine in the United States published by Success Partners L.P. (formerly VideoPlus). According to the company, the magazine "focuses on people who take full responsibility for their own development and income," and provides personal and professional development. History Success was established in 1897 by Orison Swett Marden as a manifesto for his "New Thought Philosophy," which taught positive thinking, life skills and discipline. During its early years, Success contained literary contributions of several notable New Thought writers such as Napoleon Hill, Samuel Merwin and W. Clement Stone. Relaunch Success was acquired by VideoPlus L.P. in 2007. VideoPlus, established in 1987, produces educational and marketing materials for the direct selling industry, as well as sponsored and custom publications. The April/May 2008 issue marked the relaunch of Success, as a bi-monthly magazine. Success moved to a monthly print schedule in September 2008. Darren Hardy is the magazine's former publisher.
