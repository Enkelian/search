My Bloody Underground
My Bloody Underground is the tenth studio album by American psychedelic rock band The Brian Jonestown Massacre, released on April 15, 2008 on A Records, a label set up by the band's leader, Anton Newcombe. Background My Bloody Underground was recorded at first in Liverpool, England in August of 2007; however Newcombe found that the album wasn't working out the way he'd hoped, and so, then decided to record the rest in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland in October 2007.The title of the album was originally believed to be a homage to the bands My Bloody Valentine, The Velvet Underground, and The Jesus and Mary Chain, being a combination of first two names (similar to the name of the band being a portmanteau of Rolling Stones member Brian Jones and the Jonestown Massacre) and a play on track name "My Little Underground" by The Jesus and Mary Chain. However, in an interview, Anton mentioned that the word "bloody" is used in place of the word "fucking".Rough mixes of many of the songs from the sessions were first made available on the band's MySpace page, and then as a pre-release download from the official website on September 3, 2007.
