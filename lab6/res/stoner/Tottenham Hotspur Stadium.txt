Tottenham Hotspur Stadium
The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is the home of Tottenham Hotspur in north London, replacing the club's previous stadium, White Hart Lane. It has a capacity of 62,303, making it one of the largest stadiums in the Premier League and the largest club stadium in London. It is designed to be a multi-purpose stadium and features the world's first dividing, retractable football pitch, which reveals a synthetic turf pitch underneath for NFL London Games, concerts and other events. The construction of the stadium was initiated as the centrepiece of the Northumberland Development Project, intended to be the catalyst for a 20-year regeneration plan for Tottenham. The project covers the site of the now demolished ground of White Hart Lane and areas adjacent to it. The project was first conceived in 2007 and announced in 2008, but the plan was revised several times, and the construction of the stadium, beset by disputes and delays, did not commence until 2015. The stadium subsequently opened on 3 April 2019 with a ceremony before the first Premier League game held at the stadium. The name "Tottenham Hotspur Stadium" is temporary, the intention being to sell the naming rights, so that it will be named after
