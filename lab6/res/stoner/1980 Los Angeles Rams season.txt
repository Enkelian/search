1980 Los Angeles Rams season
The 1980 Los Angeles Rams season was the team's 43rd year with the National Football League (NFL), the 35th season in Los Angeles, and the first season at Anaheim Stadium. The Rams improved from their 9-7 Super Bowl season from a year ago with an 11-5 record. They made the playoffs for the 8th straight season. Coming off a Super Bowl appearance the previous season, the Rams had high hopes of winning the Super Bowl for the first time. After a slow start to the season, the Rams caught fire and won 5 games in a row to sit at 5-2. In week 15, the Rams hosted the Dallas Cowboys on Monday Night Football. In a highly anticipated matchup, the Rams wound up crushing the reigning NFC Champs 38-14. This win clinched a playoff berth for the Rams for the 8th straight season, still a team record. However, their 8th straight playoff trip ended rather quickly, as they lost to the Cowboys in a rematch 34-13 in Dallas.
