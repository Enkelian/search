Ipecac Neat
Ipecac Neat is the first studio album by American rapper P.O.S. It was released on Doomtree Records in 2004. It was re-released on Rhymesayers Entertainment in 2005. Critical reception Marisa Brown of AllMusic gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, describing it as "an energetic, angry, intense record with dark, engaging Aesop Rock-like beats that incorporate guitar and strings loops, purposeful drums, and ominous scratches." She added, "The melodies and harmonies switch from song to song, but there's a consistency in the production, so much so that it, along with the heaviness and anger, begins to sound a bit repetitive and even weighs down the album."
