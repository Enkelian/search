...Twice Shy is the fourth studio album released by the American hard rock band Great White.

Another single, "House of Broken Love", was inspired by the painful relationship break-ups that vocalist Jack Russell and guitarist Mark Kendall had recently gone through. The album was certified Double Platinum in September 1989. The first album to feature bassist Tony Montana.
