Tuska Open Air Metal Festival
Tuska Open Air Metal Festival, commonly shortened to Tuska (Finnish: pain, agony), is a Finnish heavy metal festival taking place annually in Helsinki. The first Tuska took place in 1998 and the festival has since grown larger every year. The location of the festival has been in Kaisaniemi park in the middle of the city from 2001. However, since 2011, Tuska has taken place at the Suvilahti event field in the Sörnäinen neighbourhood. The festival dates have always been in either June or July. In recent years the attendance has grown and the festival has drawn up to 43.000 people in 2019. In 2006, the festival was almost sold out and over a combined three-day total of 33,000 attendees arrived to watch 32 artists, including for example Anathema, Celtic Frost, Opeth, Sodom, Venom, and Finland's own Amorphis and Sonata Arctica. There were three stages in Tuska: Inferno, Sue, and the main stage, Radio Rock (Radio City until 2007). In 2019 these three stages are named Inferno, Helsinki and Radio Rock Main Stage.
