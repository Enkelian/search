Schurwald
The Schurwald is a wooded mountain range in Baden-Württemberg, southern Germany, which at its highest point is 513.2 m above sea level. It is one of the most important Recreation areas for the Stuttgart area. Over the centuries, the vast forests of the mountain range supplied the surrounding towns and villages with wood for fuel and building material, and thus acquired the name "Schurwald", which comes from the German word, Schur, which can mean a shearing or clearcutting. Geography The Schurwald begins to the east of Stuttgart and runs eastwards to the foothills of the Swabian Alb, passing through the districts of Esslingen, Göppingen and Rems-Murr-Kreis. It is bordered to the south by valleys of the Neckar and Fils rivers, and to the north by the valley of the Rems.
