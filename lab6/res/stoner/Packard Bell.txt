Packard Bell
Packard Bell is a Dutch-based computer manufacturing subsidiary of Acer. The brand name originally belonged to an American radio set manufacturer, Packard Bell Corporation, founded by Herbert "Herb" A. Bell and Leon S. Packard in 1933. In 1986, Israeli investors bought the brand from Teledyne, in order to name their newly formed personal computer manufacturing company producing discount computers in the United States and Canada. In the late 1990s Packard Bell became a subsidiary of NEC. In 2000, Packard Bell stopped its North American operations and became a leading brand in the European PC markets. In 2008 it was acquired by the Taiwanese consumer electronic firm Acer in the aftermath of its takeover of Gateway, Inc. Gateway products are now sold in the Americas and Asia, while Packard Bell products are sold in Africa, Europe and the Middle East.
