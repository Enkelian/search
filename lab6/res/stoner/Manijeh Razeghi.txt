Manijeh Razeghi
Manijeh Razeghi is an Iranian-American scientist. A pioneer in the field of semiconductors and optoelectronic devices, her work at the core of 20th century optical fiber telecommunications resulted in the development of new technologies. Career In 1991, she moved to the US to become the Walter P. Murphy Professor and Director of the Center for Quantum Devices, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Northwestern University. In 2018, Razeghi won the Ben Franklin Medal for Electrical Engineering for "the realization of high-power terahertz frequency sources operating at room temperature using specially designed and manufactured semiconductor lasers, which enables a new generation of imagers, chemical/biological sensors, and ultra-broadband wireless communication systems." She developed lasers that can detect explosives and pathogens as well as electronic devices that will eventually deliver turbo-charged, super-fast WiFi. She holds 55 patents and has published 18 books and more than 1000 papers. Awards and honors Benjamin Franklin Medal in Electrical Engineering - 2018 Elected Lifetime Fellow of Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) - 2017 Jan Czochralski Gold Medal - 2016 IBM Faculty Award - 2013 Elected Lifetime Fellow of Materials Research Society (MRS)- 2008 Elected Fellow of American Physical Society (APS) - 2004 Elected Fellow
