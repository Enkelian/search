Wrapping Paper
"Wrapping Paper" is a song by the British rock group The Cream. Bassist and singer Jack Bruce composed the music, with lyrics by Pete Brown. In 1966, Reaction Records released the song on their debut single, with "Cat's Squirrel" as the B-side. It reached number 34 on the British pop singles chart in 1966. The song was later included on the compilation albums The Very Best of Cream (1995) and Those Were the Days (1997). Background In contrast with the hard blues rock of other early Cream songs such as "N.S.U." and the psychedelic pop-style of "I Feel Free," it has a distinctive slow-jazzy style. The song reflects the band's iconoclastic persona and refusal to fit into accepted and orthodox musical styles and categories. The lyrics to "Wrapping Paper" talk about a man who lost his love and finds himself constantly looking at a picture of himself and his love and keeps wishing to go back "to the house on the shore." The song's lyrics share common similarities with the songs "Dreaming" and "The Coffee Song".
