Dacha
A dacha (Russian: дача, IPA: [ˈdatɕə] (listen)) is a seasonal or year-round second home, often located in the exurbs of Russian-speaking and other post-Soviet countries. A cottage (коттедж, kottedzh) or shack serving as a family's main or only home, or an outbuilding, is not considered a dacha, although some dachas recently have been converted to year-round residences and vice versa. The word "dacha", coming from "davat'" or "give", originally referred to land alloted by the tsar to his nobles; and indeed the dacha in Soviet times is similar to the allotment in some Western countries -- a piece of land alloted, normally free, to citizens by the local government for gardening or growing vegetables for personal consumption. With time the name for the land was applied to the building on it. In some cases, owners occupy their dachas for part of the year and rent them to urban residents as summer retreats. People living in dachas are colloquially called dachniki (дачники); the term usually refers not only to dacha dwellers but to a distinctive lifestyle. The Russian term is often said to have no exact counterpart in English.Dachas are common in Russia, and are also widespread in most parts of
