Stylus
A stylus, plural styli or styluses, is a writing utensil or a small tool for some other form of marking or shaping, for example, in pottery. It can also be a computer accessory that is used to assist in navigating or providing more precision when using touchscreens. It usually refers to a narrow elongated staff, similar to a modern ballpoint pen. Many styluses are heavily curved to be held more easily. Another widely used writing tool is the stylus used by blind users in conjunction with the slate for punching out the dots in Braille. Etymology The English word stylus has two plurals: styli and styluses. The original Latin word was spelled stilus; the spelling stylus arose from an erroneous connection with Greek στυ̑λος (stylos), "pillar".The Latin word had several meanings, including "a long, sharply pointed piece of metal; the stem of a plant; a pointed instrument for incising letters; the stylus (as used in literary composition), 'pen'". The last meaning is the origin of style in the literary sense. The Latin word is probably derived from the Indo-European root *stei- "to prick", also found in the words stimulus "a goad, stimulus" and instigare "to incite, instigate". Ancient styluses Styluses
