Voltinism
Voltinism is a term used in biology to indicate the number of broods or generations of an organism in a year. The term is most often applied to insects, and is particularly in use in sericulture, where silkworm varieties vary in their voltinism. Univoltine (=Monovoltine) – (adjective) referring to organisms having one brood or generation per year Bivoltine(=divoltine)– (adjective) referring to organisms having two broods or generations per year Multivoltine(Polyvoltine) – (adjective) referring to organisms having more than two broods or generations per year Semivoltine - There are two meanings: (biology) Less than univoltine; having a brood or generation less often than once per year or (adjective) referring to organisms whose generation time is more than one year 9. Examples The speckled wood butterfly is univoltine in the northern part of its range, e.g. northern Scandinavia. Adults emerge in late spring, mate, and die shortly after laying eggs; their offspring will grow until pupation, enter diapause in anticipation of the winter, and emerge as adults the following year – thus resulting in a single generation of butterflies per year. In southern Scandinavia, the same species is bivoltine – here, the offspring of spring-emerging adults will develop directly into adults during
