Regular tunings
Among alternative guitar-tunings, regular tunings have equal musical intervals between the paired notes of their successive open strings. Guitar tunings assign pitches to the open strings of guitars. Tunings can be described by the particular pitches that are denoted by notes in Western music. By convention, the notes are ordered from lowest to highest. The standard tuning defines the string pitches as E, A, D, G, B, and E. Between the open-strings of the standard tuning are three perfect-fourths (E-A, A-D, D-G), then the major third G-B, and the fourth perfect-fourth B-E. In contrast, regular tunings have constant intervals between their successive open-strings: 3 semitones (minor third): Minor-thirds, or Diminished tuning 4 semitones (major third): Major-thirds or Augmented tuning, 5 semitones (perfect fourth): All-fourths tuning, 6 semitones (augmented fourth, tritone, or diminished fifth): Augmented-fourths tuning, 7 semitones (perfect fifth): All-fifths tuningFor the regular tunings, chords may be moved diagonally around the fretboard, as well as vertically for the repetitive regular tunings (minor thirds, major thirds, and augmented fourths). Regular tunings thus often appeal to new guitarists and also to jazz-guitarists, as they facilitate key transpositions without requiring a completely new set of fingerings for the new key.
