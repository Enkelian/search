Bachman–Turner Overdrive (1984 album)
Bachman–Turner Overdrive is the ninth studio album by Canadian rock band Bachman–Turner Overdrive, released in 1984. This is the only BTO studio album done without Robbie Bachman on drums. He disputed some of the agreements for the album and reunion, including the choice of Tim Bachman instead of Blair Thornton, and refused to join. Garry Peterson, who was Randy Bachman's bandmate in The Guess Who, plays drums on the album. This album is also the last studio album Randy Bachman has done to date with BTO. The album was originally released on Compleat Records, but it is currently in print under the Sun Record label. The leadoff song, "For the Weekend", was released as a single and also included an accompanying music video. Track listing "For the Weekend" (R. Bachman) – 4:20 "Just Look at Me Now" (T.
