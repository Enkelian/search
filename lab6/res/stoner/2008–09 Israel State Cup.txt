2008–09 Israel State Cup
The 2008–09 Israel State Cup (Hebrew: גביע המדינה‎, Gvia HaMedina) was the 70th season of Israel's nationwide football cup competition and the 55th after the Israeli Declaration of Independence. The competition was won by Beitar Jerusalem who had beaten Maccabi Haifa 2–1 in the final. As Beitar Jerusalem wasn't eligible for participating in UEFA competitions, and as runners-up Maccabi Haifa already qualified to 2009–10 UEFA Champions League, all Europa League spots were awarded to teams according to their league positions.
