44 Magnum (band)
44 Magnum (stylized as 44MAGNUM) are a Japanese heavy metal band, originally formed in Osaka Prefecture in mid-1977. They were one of the first Japanese metal bands. History After the group disbanded in 1988, they had a thirteen-year hiatus before reuniting and releasing their seventh album Ignition in 2002. In 2009, they released the self-titled album 44Magnum, which features Paul's son Stevie as a lead singer along with Paul on most of the tracks. In early 2012, frontman and sole original member Paul announced he would stop performing live with 44 Magnum to focus on treatment for Parkinson's disease, which he was diagnosed with in 2005. However, he will continue to record and write songs with the band.
