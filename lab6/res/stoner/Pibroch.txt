Pibroch
Pibroch, piobaireachd or ceòl mòr is an art music genre associated primarily with the Scottish Highlands that is characterised by extended compositions with a melodic theme and elaborate formal variations. Strictly meaning "piping" in Scottish Gaelic, piobaireachd has for some four centuries been music of the Great Highland Bagpipe. Music of a similar nature, pre-dating the adoption of the Highland pipes, has historically been played on the wire-strung Gaelic harp (clarsach) and later on the Scottish fiddle, and this form is undergoing a revival. A more general term is ceol mor (Scottish Gaelic: ceòl mòr (reformed spelling); ceòl mór (unreformed spelling)), meaning the "great music", to distinguish this complex extended art-music from the more popular Scottish music such as dances, reels, marches and strathspeys, which are called ceòl beag or "little music". Etymology The Gaelic word piobaireachd literally means "piping" or "act of piping". The word is derived from pìob ("pipes") via pìobaire ("piper") plus the abstract forming suffix -eachd. In Gaelic, pìobaireachd literally refers to any pipe music, not merely ceòl mór (lit. "big music"). Pibroch is a spelling variant first attested in Lowland Scots in 1719.Bagpipe societies, such as the Glasgow-based Piobaireachd Society, have commonly employed the term
