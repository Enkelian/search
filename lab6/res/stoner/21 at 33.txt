The album sold over 900,000 copies in the United States, missing a Platinum certification. Background The two other founding members of the original Elton John Band (active 1969â€“1975), drummer Nigel Olsson and bass player Dee Murray, reunited with him for two songs. His keyboardist James Newton-Howard returned and performed on almost every track as was the case on Rock of the Westies and Blue Moves. Other musicians included members of the Eagles and Toto as well as Peter Noone from Herman's Hermits, Bill Champlin and Toni Tennille of Captain & Tennille fame. The title comes from the fact that this was John's 21st album in total at the age of 33. According to the liner notes in the remastered edition of the album, the count includes all standard albums,
