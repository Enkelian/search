It was purchased by George Washington University in 1999, and is now known as the Mount Vernon Campus of The George Washington University. Founding of Mount Vernon Seminary and 204 F Street, NW Mount Vernon College was founded in 1875, but its roots trace back to 1868, when Elizabeth J. Somers began tutoring the young daughters of prominent Washington men in her house at 204 F Street, NW in Washington, D.C. At the time, there were no schools for the education of girls in Washington, D.C. Her first three students were the daughters of Judge Dennis Cooleyâ€”Clara, Minnie and Mary. Their father, Judge Cooley, approached Mrs. Somers and asked her to teach his daughters in preparation for their attendance at Vassar College. When Mrs. Somers began teaching the Cooley girls, she began receiving similar requests to teach other children. Her small school grew. Seven years later, in 1875, Elizabeth Somers officially opened Mount Vernon Seminary, a day school for young ladies, that offered a six-year course of instruction, including four high school and two post high school, college years. The school was named after Mount Vernon
