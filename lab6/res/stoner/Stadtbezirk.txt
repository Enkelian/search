Stadtbezirk
A Stadtbezirk (also called Ortsbezirk in Hesse and Rhineland-Palatinate) is a form of German city district, an administrative unit within a larger city. In Germany Stadtbezirke usually only exist in a metropolis with more than 150,000 inhabitants. For example, Wattenscheid, which was a town in its own right until 1974, is now a Stadtbezirk within the city of Bochum in the Ruhr area of North Rhine-Westphalia. In Hesse and Rhineland-Palatinate the term Ortsbezirk is also used for districts of smaller cities. == References ==
