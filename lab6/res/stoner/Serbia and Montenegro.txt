Serbia and Montenegro
Serbia and Montenegro (Serbian: Србија и Црна Гора / Srbija i Crna Gora, SCG), officially the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro (Државна Заједница Србија и Црна Гора / Državna Zajednica Srbija i Crna Gora), was a country in Southeast Europe. It was created from the two remaining republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia after its breakup in 1992. From its creation to 2003, when it transitioned from a formal federation to a loose confederacy, the country was known as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Савезна Република Југославија / Savezna Republika Jugoslavia), referred to colloquially as FR Yugoslavia or simply Yugoslavia. For the first several years of its existence, the state aspired to be recognized as the sole legal successor to Yugoslavia, but those claims were opposed by other former constituent republics. The United Nations also denied its request to take up Yugoslavia's membership. Eventually, after the overthrow of Slobodan Milošević from power as president of the federation in 2000, the country rescinded those aspirations and accepted the opinion of the Badinter Arbitration Committee about shared succession. It re-applied for UN membership on 27 October 2000 and was admitted on 1 November.The FRY was initially dominated by Slobodan
