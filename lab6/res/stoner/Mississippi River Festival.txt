Mississippi River Festival
The Mississippi River Festival (a.k.a. MRF) was a summer outdoor concert series held during the years 1969-1980 on the campus of Southern Illinois University in Edwardsville, Illinois. The Festival was notable due to its central midwest location, the natural ambience of its outdoor venue, and the consistent high quality of performers. On May 22, 1981, officials at SIU announced there would be no Mississippi River Festival in the upcoming summer.MRF consisted of a variety of popular rock, folk, bluegrass, and classical music performers. The more popular groups, such as The Who, Yes, Chicago, Eagles, and the Grateful Dead shows were heavily attended. Some shows attracting crowds in excess of 30,000. Jackson Browne appeared as both a backup band (for Yes in 1972 and America in 1973) and ultimately, as a lead act in 1977. He also wrote two of his songs for the live Running on Empty album in a nearby Holiday Inn at the intersection of I-270 and Illinois Route 157. It is estimated that over one million visitors attended MRF over 12 summers.In July 1969, Bob Dylan did a short surprise gig, together with The Band. It was his first performance since his notorious motorcycle accident in 1966.
