Nisaba
Nisaba (Sumerian: ð’€­ð’‰€ DNAGA; later ð’€­ð’Šºð’‰€ DÅ E.NAGA), is the Sumerian goddess of writing, learning, and the harvest. She was worshiped in shrines and sanctuaries at Umma and EreÅ¡, and was often praised by Sumerian scribes. She is considered the patroness of mortal scribes as well as the scribe of the gods. In the Babylonian period, her worship was mainly was redirected towards the god Nabu, who took over her functions. Name Nisaba's name was originally written using a combination of the cuneiform sign ð’‰€, called NAGA, and the dingir, ð’€­, representing divinity. The NAGA sign is a pictogram representing a stalk of wheat, denoting her as the divinity present within grains. Although the sign NAGA is sometimes read as Nidaba, Jeremy Black points out that "the name Nisaba (or Nissaba) seems more correct than Nidaba". She is also known by the epithet Nanibgal (Sumerian: ð’€­ð’‰€ DAN.NAGA; later ð’€­ð’Šºð’‰€ DAN.Å E.NAGA), and may have been the same goddess as Nunbarsegunu. Iconography and worship Nisaba's worship began in the city of Umma, where she was originally a grain goddess during Early Dynastic Period I, c. 2900â€“2700 BC. As a grain goddess, she was represented by the symbol of a single stalk of grain.
