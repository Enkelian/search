Great Timor
The unification (or re-unification) of East Timor, an independent state, and West Timor, a territory of Indonesia, both parts of the island of Timor, has been raised since the mid-20th century. Great Timor (Indonesian: Timor Raya) refers to the irredentist concept of a united and independent island of Timor, covering formerly Portuguese East Timor and formerly Dutch (now Indonesian) West Timor. Historically, the idea of uniting Timor Island had been expressed by several Timorese groups. The earliest reference point is the pre-colonial Empire of Wehali, whose center was in today's West Timor, but the ruling group was the Tetun speaking Belunese associated with the inhabitants of the Eastern Timor.During the Japanese Occupation of the Island (1942–45), there were some Japanese and Timorese efforts to unite West and East Timor through match-making between the traditional authorities of Dutch and Portuguese Timor. Especially, Tōru Maeda (a Japanese intelligence agent, later poet, who served in Viqueque and Atambua) was instrumental in a matchmaking between the family of Don. Joaquim da Costa of Ossu and the Nai-Buti clan in Atambua.During 1974–75, APODETI, an East Timorese party expressed its will to integrate East Timor and West Timor through an integration into the Republic of Indonesia.
