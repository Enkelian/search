Absolutego
Absolutego is the debut studio album by Japanese experimental band Boris. It was released in 1996 by Fangs Anal Satan. This album shows inspiration from the Melvins and, most prominently, Earth. Excluding the Merzbow collaboration Sun Baked Snow Cave, it is the only "one-long-song" Boris album that is not broken down into multiple parts. A song with the same title also appears in the album Dear. In 2001 Southern Lord Records re-released this album remastered with an alternative cover and relabeled as Absolutego+ (Special Low Frequency Version) in homage to Earth 2. This reissue included a bonus drone track recorded in 1997; its title would be reused 4 years later for an album also called Dronevil (a trend which continued with two albums titled Heavy Rocks, one in 2002 and another in 2011). Southern Lord also released the 2001 remaster on vinyl in 2011 with new artwork, splitting the title track arbitrarily with cutoffs to fill the first three sides; the fourth side contains the final 9:35 and bonus track "Dronevil 2."
