War Child (song)
"War Child" is a 1982 song by the American rock band Blondie, featured on their sixth studio album The Hunter. The song was released as a second single from the album in various countries, but not in the band's native US. Single information "War Child" was written by Debbie Harry and Nigel Harrison, who had previously written the hits "One Way or Another" and "Union City Blue" together. The lyrics make reference to war in Cambodia and Middle East. The single was the second and final release from the album, and would therefore be the last new Blondie single for seventeen years, when the band reformed and released "Maria" in 1999. The B-side to this single was "Little Caesar", also from The Hunter album. The 12" single included an extended remix of "War Child" by producer Mike Chapman, which can be found as a bonus track on EMI's 1994 and 2001 CD re-issues of the album The Hunter.
