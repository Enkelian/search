Lydiard Park
Lydiard Park is a 260-acre (110-hectare) country park at Lydiard Tregoze, which was its formal name, about 3 miles (5 km) west of central Swindon, Wiltshire, England, near Junction 16 of the M4 motorway. History A settlement at Lediar, with woodland, is mentioned in the Domesday Book and was owned by the Tregoze family from about 1198. In 1259, Henry III gave Robert Tregoze a royal licence to create a deer park in nearby woodland. In 1420 the estate came by marriage to the St John family (whose seat was at Battersea, London), and they owned it until the Second World War.Formal gardens and a canal were created as part of changes made to the medieval house in the 17th century; Sir John St John also laid out a series of formal avenues. However, many of the formal elements of the park had been removed by 1766. Surviving features from the 18th century include a semi-underground ice house and a walled garden, with a bronze sundial at its centre. Large parts of the park were sold off in the 1920s and 1930s.From 1942 the park was used as a military hospital by the American Forces, and then between about 1943
