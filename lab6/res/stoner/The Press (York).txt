The Press (York)
The Press is the local daily paper for a substantial area of North and East Yorkshire, based in the city of York. It is printed by the Newsquest (York) Ltd, a subsidiary of the Newsquest Media Group. Known as the Yorkshire Evening Press since its first publication in 1882 until the late 1990s, the paper changed from broadsheet to compact format on 6 September 2004 and shortly afterwards dropped "York" from its title and moved to morning printing on 24 April 2006, when the title changed to reflect the revised schedule. In addition to York, principal towns covered by the paper include Selby, Tadcaster, Thirsk, Easingwold, Harrogate, Ryedale (including Malton, Norton and Pickering) and the wider east coast. The Press often runs local campaigns, such as the "Guardian Angels" appeal and the "Change It" campaign. In 2010-2011 it had a circulation of 25,989 however by the end of 2018 that had dropped to just over 11,000 References External links York Press, stories from The Press Newsquest (York) Ltd Newsquest Media Group
