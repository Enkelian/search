WLNY-TV
WLNY-TV, virtual channel 55 (UHF digital channel 29), is an independent television station licensed to Riverhead, New York, United States and serving the New York City television market. The station is owned by the CBS Television Stations subsidiary of ViacomCBS, as part of a duopoly with New York-licensed CBS flagship WCBS-TV (channel 2).
