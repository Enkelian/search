Thee Headcoats
Thee Headcoats was a band formed in Chatham, Kent, England in 1989, that was well known for its garage rock sound, explicitly sticking to this style on almost all of their albums. The band's signature sound as well as their prolific writing has been attributed to Billy Childish's love of simple, direct recording. The band has been on multiple labels including Billy's own Hangman Records, Damaged Goods and Sub Pop. The band played their final concert on 12 May 2000 at the Dirty Water Club. Childish went on to play with other bands including The Buff Medways (1999 to 2006) and The Musicians of The British Empire (2007 to 2011). Lineup The band was composed of Billy Childish (guitar and vocals), Bruce Brand (drums and backing vocals), and Johnny Johnson (bass). The band is the most prolific of Childish's many musical projects so far, releasing fourteen full-length albums. The group originally featured Allan Crockford (ex-The Prisoners) (credited as Krojack on the first LP, Headcoats Down), followed by John Agnew (ex-Thee Mighty Caesars) then Ollie Dolat (co-founder of The Squares and founder of Mr Zero) on bass before Johnson joined.
