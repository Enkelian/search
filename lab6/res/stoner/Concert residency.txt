Concert residency
A concert residency (also known as musical residency or simply residency) is a series of concerts, similar to a concert tour, but only performed at one location. An artist who performs on a concert residency is called a resident performer. Concert residencies have been the staple of the Las Vegas Strip for decades, pioneered by singer-pianist Liberace in the 1940s and Frank Sinatra with the Rat Pack in the 1950s. According to Billboard, Celine Dion's A New Day... is the most successful concert residency of all time, grossing over US$385 million ($474.72 million in 2019 dollars) and drawing nearly three million people to 717 shows. This commercial success was credited for revitalizing Las Vegas residencies, which was always known as a place where singers go when their careers are in decline. History According to The Guardian, the concept of a concert residency was established by pianist and singer Liberace with 1944 debut in Las Vegas. Nearly ten years later, Liberace had his own show at the Riviera Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, which reportedly earned "Mr. Showtime" around $50,000 per week. After years of pursuing other projects in Los Angeles, he returned to Vegas residency and earned around $300,000
