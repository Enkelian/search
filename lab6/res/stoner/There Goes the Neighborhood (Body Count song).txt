There Goes the Neighborhood (Body Count song)
"There Goes the Neighborhood" is the twelfth track of Body Count's self-titled debut album. The song is a sarcastic response to critics, sung from the point of view of a racist white rocker who wonders "Don't they know rock's just for whites? / Don't they know the rules? / Those niggers are too hardcore / This shit ain't cool." For the song's music video, the word "nigger" was replaced with the phrase "black boys". The music video, directed by Matt Mahurin, ends with a black musician implanting an electric guitar into the ground and setting it on fire. The final image is similar to that of a burning cross.The main guitar riff was later sampled in Vaginal Jesus "Beat Rodney Down" and Anal Cunt's "Lenny's in My Neighborhood".
