Jawbox
Jawbox is an American alternative rock band from Washington, D.C., United States. Its original members were J. Robbins (vocals, guitar), Kim Coletta (bass guitar) and Adam Wade (drums). Bill Barbot (vocals, guitar) later came on board and Zach Barocas (drums) joined the group replacing Wade. History Robbins had played in the final incarnation of Government Issue, which was the longest lived of the original Washington, D.C. punk bands. After Government Issue called it quits, Robbins formed Jawbox with Kim Coletta and Adam Wade. The trio recorded a demo cassette and their first, self-released single (this was also the beginning of their use of the Desoto Records rubric, which went on to become a formal, successful independent record label); inclusion of the song "Bullet Park" on the Maximumrocknroll compilation They Don't Get Paid, They Don't Get Laid, But Boy Do They Work Hard (1989) was their most widespread early exposure. They also recorded a four-song EP, Jawbox (1990), which was incorporated into the CD release of their first album, Grippe (both released by Dischord Records). Shortly afterwards, Bill Barbot joined the band as second guitarist and second singer. Not long after, they recorded Novelty with Iain Burgess, and toured the USA.
