The High Water Marks
The High Water Marks is an indie rock band associated with the Elephant 6 collective. The band has two lead creative members, Hilarie Sidney and Per Ole Bratset, who co-write the band's music. Band history Hilarie Sidney, drummer for The Apples in Stereo and Per Ole Bratset of the band Palermo met during an Apples in Stereo performance in Oslo, Norway. The two became friends and began recording songs together through the mail before deciding to record together in the United States. During this time, the band's debut album Songs About the Ocean was recorded with Sidney and Bratset performing all of the instruments themselves. Sidney and Bratset, now married, were joined by Jim Lindsay (former Oranger member and Preston School of Industry contributor) and Mike Snowden (known for his work in Von Hemmling and Real Numbers) to play drums and bass, respectively. With this four member lineup, The High Water Marks recorded the album Polar, which was released September 2007.
