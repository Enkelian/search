M.O.D.
M.O.D. (abbreviation for Method of Destruction) is a crossover thrash band from New York City, fronted by Stormtroopers of Death vocalist Billy Milano. The band has been around for 34 years (minus one hiatus from 1997 to 2001), and released eight studio albums. With M.O.D., Milano sought to continue on the musical path of the bands Anthrax, Stormtroopers of Death and Nuclear Assault, mixing shades of hardcore punk with thrash metal and often humorous and politically incorrect lyrics. History First four albums (1986â€“1993) U.S.A. for M.O.D., the band's debut album, was produced by S.O.D. bandmate and Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian.

The band would return to their roots on Gross Misconduct, as well as further expand their sound on Rhythm of Fear. It was around this time that Milano performed a reunion show with S.O.D. at The Ritz in New
