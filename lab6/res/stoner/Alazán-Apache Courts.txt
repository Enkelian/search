Alaz치n-Apache Courts
Alaz치n-Apache Courts is a public housing community in San Antonio. The neighborhood is located on the city's West Side, and was built in 1939. It was the first public housing built in the city and is currently made up of three different properties: Alaz치n, Apache and Guadalupe Homes. It is also one of the first public housing projects in the United States and originally served a predominantly Mexican-American neighborhood. History San Antonio had the largest Mexican population in Texas in 1930 and most were unskilled laborers with low-paying jobs. Because of the poverty that most people of Mexican descent lived in, there was a "miserable standard of living." In 1930, only 30% of Mexican Americans were homeowners in San Antonio, as compared to 40% black and 50% white homeowners.Alaz치n-Apache Courts was funded by the United States Housing Authority (USHA) in September 1937. It was originally created to house "exclusively Mexican residents." The project had the support of a local priest, Father Carmelo Tranchese, who was the pastor of the Our Lady of Guadalupe Church. He was also one of the five commissioners on the newly created San Antonio Housing Authority (SAHS). The project also had support from Mayor Charles K.
