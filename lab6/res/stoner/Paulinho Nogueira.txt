He was the teacher of Toquinho. Craviola The Craviola is an acoustic guitar designed by Paulinho Nogueira and built by manufacturer Giannini. Craviolas have a distinct asymmetric body shape that deviates from the upper and lower bouts of classical guitars. Its timbre is said to resemble a combination of sounds from a harpsichord and a viola caipira, hence the portmanteau (Cravo is the Portuguese word for harpsichord). Craviolas can be six-string or twelve-string (either nylon or steel) and are produced solely by Giannini.
