Nuit Blanche
Nuit Blanche (French pronunciation: ​[nɥi ˈblɑ̃ʃ]) (White Night) is an annual all-night or night-time arts festival of a city. A Nuit Blanche will typically have museums, private and public art galleries, and other cultural institutions open and free of charge, with the centre of the city itself being turned into a de facto art gallery, providing space for art installations, performances (music, film, dance, performance art), themed social gatherings, and other activities. History In 1989, the Helsinki Festival established its Night of the Arts, "when every gallery, museum and bookshop is open until midnight or later and the whole city becomes one giant performance and carnival venue". A year later, the mayor of Nantes, Jean-Marc Ayrault's program included renovating the central city and establishing a "contemporary patrimony", which led arts programmer Jean Blaise to create a late-night cultural festival, "Les Allumées" ("Things Alight"). His concept was to have an arts festival in Nantes, from 6 pm to 6 am, over six years with artists from six cities. They were as follows: Barcelona, 15–20 October 1990 St. Petersburg, 14–19 October 1991 Buenos Aires, 19–24 October 1992 Naples, 18–23 October 1993 Cairo, 17–22 October 1994 Havana, 16–21 October 1995.
