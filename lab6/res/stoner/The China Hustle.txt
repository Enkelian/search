The China Hustle
The China Hustle is a 2017 finance documentary produced by Magnolia Pictures and directed by Jed Rothstein. The documentary depicts a systematic securities fraud that continues to occur in the United States, wherein small nondescript Chinese companies are hyped up and sold by American investment banks to U.S. based investors. Many of the film's protagonists are activist shareholders and Due diligence professionals who discovered the fraud and subsequently short-sold the toxic stock in order to bring about the collapse of the fraudulent entities. Synopsis After the financial crisis of 2007â€“2008, as investment firms in the United States look for ways to improve clients' investment performance while earning money for themselves, they chance upon the idea of selling opportunities to unsuspecting Americans who want to get rich by participating in the "China growth story" but do not know much about the country or its companies. They do so by getting small nondescript Chinese companies (like Orient Paper and Advanced Battery Technologies (ABAT) to do reverse mergers with defunct American companies (like Buffalo Mining) and thus get listed in the NYSE overnight. The hype that accompanies this is aided by paid guest appearances by the likes of Bill Clinton and Henry Kissinger
