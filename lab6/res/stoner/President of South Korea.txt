President of South Korea
The President of the Republic of Korea (Korean: 대한민국 대통령; Hanja: 大韓民國 大統領; RR: Daehan Minguk Daetongnyeong; informally referred to as POTROK or POSK) is the chief executive of South Korea as the head of state and head of government, as well as the commander-in-chief of the South Korean Armed Forces. The Constitution and the amended Presidential Election Act of 1987 provide for election of the president by direct, secret ballot, ending sixteen years of indirect presidential elections under the preceding two governments. The president is directly elected to a five-year term, with no possibility of re-election. If a presidential vacancy should occur, a successor must be elected within sixty days, during which time presidential duties are to be performed by the prime minister or other senior cabinet members in the order of priority as determined by law. While in office, the chief executive lives in Cheong Wa Dae (the "Blue House"), and is exempt from criminal liability (except for insurrection or treason). Moon Jae-in, former human rights lawyer and chief of staff to then-President Roh Moo-hyun, assumed post of President of South Korea on 10 May 2017 immediately upon being elected with a plurality of 41.1%, in contrast to
