Apportionment in the Hellenic Parliament
Apportionment in the Hellenic Parliament refers to those provisions of the Greek electoral law relating to the distribution of Greece's 300 parliamentary seats to the parliamentary constituencies, as well as to the method of seat allocation in Greek legislative elections for the various political parties. The electoral law was codified for the first time through a 2012 Presidential Decree. Articles 1, 2, and 3 deal with how the parliamentary seats are allocated to the various constituencies, while articles 99 and 100 legislate the method of parliamentary apportionment for political parties in an election. In both cases, Greece uses the largest remainder method. Up to and including the 2019 Greek legislative election, Greece will continue to employ a semi-proportional representation system with a 50-seat majority bonus. The next election will see the electoral system change to proportional representation, as the majority bonus will cease to be applied since it was abolished in 2016. This article is reflective of this method. The election after next will revert back to semi-proportional representation with a sliding scale bonus after it was passed in parliament in 2020.
