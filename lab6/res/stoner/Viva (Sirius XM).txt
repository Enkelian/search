Viva (Sirius XM)
Viva is a channel on the Sirius XM Radio network that specialized in playing Latin Pop music from the 1990s and Today. It was retired from the XM line-up on November 12, 2008 as part of the combined channel restructure resulting from the Sirius-XM merger. Some of the music content previously played by Viva is now available on Caliente. Due to complaints from many XM users, Sirius XM has put Viva back on. However, it is only available online to listeners.
