Mass concentration (chemistry)
In chemistry, the mass concentration ρi (or γi) is defined as the mass of a constituent mi divided by the volume of the mixture V. ρ i = m i V {\displaystyle \rho _{i}={\frac {m_{i}}{V}}} For a pure chemical the mass concentration equals its density (mass divided by volume); thus the mass concentration of a component in a mixture can be called the density of a component in a mixture. This explains the usage of ρ (the lower case Greek letter rho), the symbol most often used for density. Definition and properties The volume V in the definition refers to the volume of the solution, not the volume of the solvent. One litre of a solution usually contains either slightly more or slightly less than 1 litre of solvent because the process of dissolution causes volume of liquid to increase or decrease. Sometimes the mass concentration is called titer. Notation The notation common with mass density underlines the connection between the two quantities (the mass concentration being the mass density of a component in the solution), but it can be a source of confusion especially when they appear in the same formula undifferentiated by an additional symbol (like a star
