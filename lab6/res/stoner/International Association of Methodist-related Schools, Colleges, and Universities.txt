International Association of Methodist-related Schools, Colleges, and Universities
International Association of Methodist-related Schools, Colleges, and Universities (IAMSCU) is a private, not-for-profit organization of colleges and universities associated with the United Methodist Church. All the institutions are historically affiliated with the church and its organizations. Several institutions, but not all, are legally autonomous under their own boards of trustees and separately chartered by their respective states. The IAMSCU seeks to enable Methodist-related educational institutions and those with a Methodist tradition to cooperate through the development of common understandings.
