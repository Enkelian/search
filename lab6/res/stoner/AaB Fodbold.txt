AaB, (full name: Aalborg Boldspilklub, pronounced [ˈʌlˌpɒˀ ˈpʌlˀtspe̝lˌkʰlup]) internationally referred to as Aalborg BK is a professional football team located in Aalborg. The club is represented in the Danish Superliga and has won four Danish football Championships and three Danish Cup trophies. Most recently the team won the double in 2014. In 1995 AaB became the first Danish team to participate in the UEFA Champions League group stage when they were awarded a place because Dynamo Kiev was expelled from the tournament after one game for attempted match-fixing. AaB qualified for the 2008–09 Champions League and is with two appearances the Danish club who has participated the second most in the tournament after F.C. Copenhagen. History Aalborg BK was part of the top-flight Danish leagues from the 1928–29 season, until the relegation of the club in 1947. The club returned to the best league in 1963, and except from the years of 1972, 1978 and 1981–1986, Aalborg BK has since been a part of the various editions of the Danish football championship. Despite its many years in the Danish championship, the club never won a championship title, but Aalborg BK won the Danish Cup competition in 1966 and 1970. Paid
