Hand of Doom
"Hand of Doom" is a song by the English heavy metal band Black Sabbath, originally appearing on their second album Paranoid, released in 1970. Background The song was conceived after the band had observed a growing number of US soldiers arriving in England from the Vietnam War in the late 1960s with severe drug addictions. The song paints an unflattering picture of hard drug use. The lyrics were written by Geezer Butler while the music is credited to the entire band.

Danzig on its 1996 album, Blackacidevil, and on the Black Sabbath fan compilation, Nativity in Black III, based on the tribute albums Nativity in Black I and II. Isis on its 1999 EP, Sawblade. Eyehategod on a split album with Anal Cunt. Orange Goblin on a split with Electric Wizard. HIM as one of their B-sides on the single The Funeral of Hearts, and on their 2007 compilation album, Uneasy Listening Vol. 2. Reverend on its 1990 debut album World Won't Miss You.
