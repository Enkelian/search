Estadio Benito Villamarín
Estadio Benito Villamarín is a stadium in Seville, Spain, and the home of Real Betis since its completion in 1929. With a capacity of 60,720, it is the 4th-largest stadium in Spain and the largest in Andalusia. History Construction As early as 1912, the Spanish architect Aníbal González Álvarez-Ossorio had an initial design of a stadium for the Ibero-American Exposition of 1929. The executive committee has commissioned the architect Antonio Illanes del Río to complete the design in 1923. Several locations were considered for the new stadium when finally the current location was chosen by commissar Cruz Conde. The technical study for its construction was carried out by Manuel María Smith who has designed the San Mamés Stadium of Bilbao in 1913. The construction works were launched in 1923 and finally completed by the end of 1928. Inauguration The newly-built Estadio de la Exposición was officially inaugurated on March 17, 1929, hosting an international match where Spain defeated Portugal 5-0, after being blessed by Archbishop Eustaquio Ilundáin y Esteban of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Seville. After the end of the exhibition in 1930, the venue remained as a municipal property, although Real Betis began to play their home matches
