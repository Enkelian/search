2009 St. Louis Rams season
The 2009 St. Louis Rams season was the team's 72nd season in the National Football League, and its 15th in St. Louis. Due to the Rams winning only against the Detroit Lions, they finished with the NFL's worst record at 1–15, earning the first overall selection in the 2010 NFL Draft in Steve Spagnuolo's first season as a head coach. The 2009 Rams scored 175 points (10.9 per game), the sixth-fewest for a 16-game NFL season. The Rams threw only twelve combined touchdown passes all season – including one by kicker Josh Brown. Quarterback Marc Bulger led the team with five touchdown passes. Pro Football Reference argues that the 2009 Rams were the worst team fielded in the NFL since the expansion Tampa Bay Buccaneers of 1976 and 1977, having a much weaker schedule than the winless 2008 Lions.In the three seasons from 2007 to 2009, the Rams won a total of six games, this being the worst record over such a period since the Chicago Cardinals during World War II until the 2015 to 2017 Cleveland Browns won only four games. Ironically, the Cardinals never won fewer than four games in any season during their tenure in St. Louis
