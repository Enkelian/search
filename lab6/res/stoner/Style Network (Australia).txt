Style Network (Australia)
Style Network (known on air as Style) was an Australian pay television channel that owned by Universal Networks International. It was a domestic version of the American Style Network (which it outlasted by six years after that network was converted to the short-lived men's interest Esquire Network), and much like its American counterpart it featured fashion, design, and programming for women.It was available through the Foxtel and FetchTV platforms. In 2014, it became available on Australian streaming service Foxtel Play. History Style was launched on the Foxtel and Austar platforms on 15 November 2009. The channel abruptly ceased broadcasting on 17 December 2019, after Foxtel changed around their lineup and UNI decided to consolidate programming on several networks, also ending operations of 13th Street and Syfy at the end of 2019.
