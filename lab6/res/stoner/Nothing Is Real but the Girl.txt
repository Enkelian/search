Nothing Is Real but the Girl
"Nothing Is Real but the Girl" is a 1999 song by the American rock band Blondie. Written by the band's keyboardist Jimmy Destri, it was the second single taken from their seventh album No Exit. Overview The single was a minor hit in the UK, peaking at #26, and #89 in Germany. Destri wrote the song with his daughter in mind; however, when the song was re-recorded for the single release, the narrative was changed from the third person to the first, shifting the focus of the song onto vocalist Debbie Harry. For example, "Only her eyes feel solid" became "Only my eyes feel solid". New lyrics were also written for the bridge.
