Beanland (band)
Beanland was a roots rock jam band, based in Oxford, Mississippi, which performed and recorded primarily from 1986 to 1993. Beanland was founded in Oxford in 1985 by guitarists Bill McCrory and George McConnell, with Adam Stoll on drums and harmonica. After some early shuffling, the band's line-up consisted of McConnell and McCrory on guitar, John "JoJo" Hermann on keyboards, Ron Lewis on bass, and Harry Peel on drums. The band recorded a self-titled debut album in 1991 and toured extensively, mainly around the South and Southwest, playing blues-oriented rock as part of the nascent early-1990s jamband renaissance. Shortly after the album's release, keyboardist John "JoJo" Hermann left Beanland to join Widespread Panic. McConnell kept Beanland alive briefly as a four-piece with a much-altered line-up, and recorded a follow-up album in 1992, but the band dissolved soon after. George McConnell later joined JoJo Hermann in Widespread Panic, serving as that band's lead guitarist from 2002-2006. The Beanland songs "Sellin' The Rain" and "Doreatha" from the debut album garnered some airplay on college radio stations throughout the Southeastern United States. The band has a moderate cult following. Beanland has played several reunion shows, most recently in 2004 at the Double Decker
