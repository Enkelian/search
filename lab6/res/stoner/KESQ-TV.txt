KESQ-TV
KESQ-TV, virtual channel 42 (UHF digital channel 28), is an ABC-affiliated television station licensed to Palm Springs, California, United States and serving the Coachella Valley in California's Inland Empire. Owned by the News-Press & Gazette Company, it is sister to five low-power stations: Cathedral City-licensed Class A CBS affiliate KPSP-CD (channel 38), Class A Fox affiliate KDFX-CD (channel 33, licensed to both Indio and Palm Springs), Palm Springs-licensed CW+ affiliate KCWQ-LD (channel 2), Indio-licensed Telemundo affiliate KUNA-LP (analog channel 15), and low-powered AccuWeather affiliate KYAV-LD (channel 12); this existing co-ownership of all these five stations allows for KESQ to also be used to offer full-market over-the-air standard definition simulcasts of KPSP-CD (simulcast over KESQ-DT2), KDFX-CD (simulcast over KESQ-DT4), KUNA-LP (simulcast over KESQ-DT7), and KCWQ-LD (simulcast over KESQ-DT8), to better serve viewers throughout the market that don't subscribe to either cable or satellite television services. The six stations share studios on Dunham Way in Thousand Palms; KESQ's transmitter is located on Edom Hill northeast of Cathedral City and I-10. Along with other major Coachella Valley television stations, KESQ-TV identifies itself on-air using its cable designation (News Channel 3) rather than its over-the-air channel position. The unusual practice stems in part from
