Graphite
Graphite (), archaically referred to as plumbago, is a crystalline form of the element carbon with its atoms arranged in a hexagonal structure. It occurs naturally in this form and is the most stable form of carbon under standard conditions. Under high pressures and temperatures it converts to diamond. Graphite is used in pencils and lubricants. It is a good conductor of heat and electricity. Its high conductivity makes it useful in electronic products such as electrodes, batteries, and solar panels. Types and varieties The principal types of natural graphite, each occurring in different types of ore deposits, are Crystalline small flakes of graphite (or flake graphite) occurs as isolated, flat, plate-like particles with hexagonal edges if unbroken. When broken the edges can be irregular or angular; Amorphous graphite: very fine flake graphite is sometimes called amorphous; Lump graphite (or vein graphite) occurs in fissure veins or fractures and appears as massive platy intergrowths of fibrous or acicular crystalline aggregates, and is probably hydrothermal in origin. Highly ordered pyrolytic graphite refers to graphite with an angular spread between the graphite sheets of less than 1Â°. The name "graphite fiber" is sometimes used to refer to carbon fibers or carbon fiber-reinforced
