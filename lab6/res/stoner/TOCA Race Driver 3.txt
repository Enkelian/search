TOCA Race Driver 3
TOCA Race Driver 3 (DTM Race Driver 3 in Germany, V8 Supercars 3 in Australia, TOCA Race Driver 3 Challenge in the PlayStation Portable version and Race Driver: Create & Race in the Nintendo DS version) is a racing video game developed and published by Codemasters for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, Xbox, PlayStation Portable, Nintendo DS and OS X. It is the sixth game in the TOCA series. The game features several fully licensed championships, including the DTM series and V8 Supercar championship. This is the last in the series to have TOCA in its title as following on from this TOCA was dropped in favour of just Race Driver. It includes 120 Championships and 35 types of racing through the Championship in World Tour, Pro Career, and Free Race. Also it has Bonus Championships in different disciplines. They take place largely in the UK and Germany, though many more tracks are unlocked by winning cups in Pro Career, or by setting a lap time record on a course within Pro Career mode. Open wheel, GT, Oval racing, Rallying and Off-road racing were all featured, and can be raced in either a detailed Pro Career mode or an open-ended World
