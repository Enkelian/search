2009–10 La Liga
The 2009–10 La Liga season (known as the Liga BBVA for sponsorship reasons) was the 79th La Liga since its establishment. Barcelona were the defending champions, having won their 19th La Liga title in the previous season. The campaign began on 29 August 2009 ended on 16 May 2010 due to all top-flight European leagues ending earlier than the previous season because of 2010 FIFA World Cup. A total of 20 teams contested the league, 17 of which already contested in the 2008–09 season and three of which were promoted from the Segunda División. In addition, a new match ball - the Nike T90 Ascente - served as the official ball for all matches. On 16 May 2010, Barcelona were declared champions after their 4–0 victory over Valladolid, their 20th La Liga title. Lionel Messi won the LFP Award for Best Player for the second consecutive time.
