Martha My Dear
"Martha My Dear" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1968 eponymous double album The Beatles (also known as the "White Album"). Credited to Lennon–McCartney, the song was solely written by Paul McCartney about his Old English Sheepdog, Martha, he owned at the time. Style and form The song features a music hall-inspired piano line that recurs throughout the piece, as well as a brass section. The song modulates through several keys. The song key is E♭ major, showing up embellished chords with jazzy sprinkled dissonances. The verse is a syncopated replicate of the first melodic section adding two extra beats, a technique similar to that used later by McCartney in “Two of Us”. Though the bridge is in the key of F major, the manner in which it abruptly sets in and exits makes it sound more out-of-the-way than it really is. Recording The song was recorded over two days on 4 and 5 October 1968 at Trident Studios in London. McCartney recorded the piano, drums, and vocals on the first day. He was advised to have George Martin play the piano solo because it was believed that the solo was beyond Paul's competency,
