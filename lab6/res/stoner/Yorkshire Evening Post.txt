Yorkshire Evening Post
The Yorkshire Evening Post is a daily evening publication (delivered to newsagents every morning) published by Yorkshire Post Newspapers in Leeds, West Yorkshire, England. The paper provides a regional slant on the day's news, and traditionally provides close reporting on Leeds United and Leeds Rhinos as well as the Yorkshire County Cricket Club team. The newspaper generally takes a liberal/centre left position, unlike The Yorkshire Post, which has a particularly conservative bias. Despite its title that implies the paper is Yorkshire wide it is a Leeds-based paper, still widely circulated in Bradford, Harrogate, Huddersfield and Wakefield as well. The City of Leeds has two further widely circulated local papers, being the Wetherby News and the Wharfedale and Airedale Observer. For many years, the Evening Post produced a separate edition for South Yorkshire printed simultaneously in Doncaster. In 1970 that was converted into the now-closed Doncaster Evening Post. In his 2015 memoir former reporter Revel Barker recalls the 1960s: "During the cricket season...the Evening Post would be on the streets at 10.30 a.m. The 'First' would be out about noon, the 'Final' at 2 p.m., the 'One-star final' around 3.30 and the 'Late Night Final' about 4.30. the Post was selling
