1940–41 La Liga
The 1940–41 La Liga was the tenth season since its establishment. Atlético Aviación retained the title. Format changes Due to the expansion of the league to 14 teams for the next season, the two last qualified teams, instead of being directly relegated to Segunda División, faced the third and fourth qualified teams in a single-game play-off match. Team locations After an absence of one season due to the damages in their stadium, Oviedo came back to La Liga. Murcia made its debut this season. With the arrival of the Francoism, in 1941 a law that forbid the use of foreign names like Athletic, Sporting or Racing was approved. However, the clubs recovered their Royal patronages and started to use again the term Real in their denominations.
