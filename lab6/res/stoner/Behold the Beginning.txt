Behold the Beginning
Behold the Beginning is a compilation album by the heavy metal band Diamond Head. It was released after their poorly received Canterbury album and subsequent break-up and is composed mostly of tracks from the band's debut album, Lightning to the Nations, as well as the non-LP single "Waited Too Long" and its B-side "Play It Loud". The album was remixed by the band's guitarist Brian Tatler. Behold the Beginning was later re-released in 1991 by Heavy Metal Records on CD format.
