Limes (Roman Empire)
A limes (plural: līmitēs) was a frontier of the Roman Empire; the limites were the furthest fortifications and territory the Romans defended, often existing beyond the administrative borders of the Roman Empire. They are most often associated with Roman fortresses in Germania and to a lesser extent with Britannia, but the concept could apply to any adjoining area the Romans exercised loose control over with military forces. A limes could monitor and hinder any invaders or raiders before they reached the "civilized" interior. Overview The Roman frontier stretched for more than 5,000 kilometres (3,100 mi) from the Atlantic coast of northern Britain, through Europe to the Black Sea, and from there to the Red Sea and across North Africa to the Atlantic coast. The remains of the limites today consist of vestiges of walls, ditches, forts, fortresses, and civilian settlements. Certain elements of the frontier have been excavated, some reconstructed, and a few destroyed. The two sections of limes in Germany cover a length of 550 kilometres (340 mi) from the north-west of the country to the Danube in the south-east. The 118 km long Hadrian's Wall was built on the orders of the Emperor Hadrian c. AD 122 at
