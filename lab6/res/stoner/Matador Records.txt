Matador Records
Matador Records is an independent record label, with a roster of mainly indie rock, but also punk rock, experimental rock, alternative rock, and electronic acts. History Matador was created in 1989 by Chris Lombardi in his New York City apartment. Lombardi brought the Austrian duo H.P. Zinker into Wharton Tiers’ Fun City studio to record Matador's first release, "...and there was light". Lombardi continued to add artists to the label's roster, with bands like the Dustdevils, Railroad Jerk and Superchunk, before being joined by former Homestead Records manager Gerard Cosloy in 1990. The two of them have run it together since. Matador experienced its first taste of crazed media attention & big sales with the North American release of Teenage Fanclub’s debut record, A Catholic Education in 1990. In 1992 Matador released Pavement's debut studio album Slanted and Enchanted. In 1993, not only did Matador release Liz Phair's critically and commercially successful debut album, Exile in Guyville, but the label also began a partnership with Atlantic Records which lasted for several years. In 1996, Capitol Records purchased a 49 percent stake in Matador, which Lombardi and Cosloy bought back in 1999. Beggars Group purchased 50% of Matador in 2002 and
