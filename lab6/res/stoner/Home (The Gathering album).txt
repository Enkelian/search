Home (The Gathering album)
Home is the eighth album by Dutch band The Gathering. The album was released on 15 April 2006 by Sanctuary Records through its heavy metal label Noise. The album had a separate release in North America which took place on 18 April 2006 by Brooklyn-based label The End Records. It was the last album to feature lead singer and lyricist Anneke van Giersbergen. In an interview for the San Diego-based magazine Modern Fix, drummer Hans Rutten described Home as being "more stripped-down...Souvenirs was quite structured and was quite heavy to make. This one is more simple, I think, but still there, still in a Gathering kind of way. But rhythmically speaking, it's more stripped-down, it's more primitive, I think. I think 'primitive' is a good word...it's more instinctive (and) more primitive. It's not as layered as Souvenirs, and maybe it's less 'trippish.' Maybe it's more...yeah, primitive trip-rock, something like that." Track listing All lyrics are written by Anneke van Giersbergen; all music is composed by The Gathering.
