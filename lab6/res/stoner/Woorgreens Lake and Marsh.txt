Woorgreens Lake and Marsh (grid reference SO630127) is a 9-hectare (22-acre) nature reserve in Gloucestershire.The site is owned by the Forestry Commission and is managed by the Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust in partnership with the Forestry Commission. The site is listed in the 'Forest of Dean Local Plan Review' as a Key Wildlife Site (KWS). Location and habitat The nature reserve lies in the heart of the Forest of Dean, on the B4226 between Cinderford and Coleford and east of Cannop. It is about half a mile to the east of Speech House. This has been a nature reserve managed by the Trust since 1984. It consists of reclaimed land from open-cast mine workings and has lake, marsh and open heath habitats. Mining ceased in 1981, and the area has been swiftly colonised by a significant variety of plants and animals. There is a main lake which is surrounded by tree plantations. These consist mainly of Oak, Alder, Larch and Corsican Pine. Areas to be kept open were identified and this planning has ensured the creation of large areas of open heathland habitat.The water on the site is controlled by a sluice and is linked with that of Foxes Bridge Bog,
