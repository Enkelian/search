The Man Who Sold the World (album)
The Man Who Sold the World is the third studio album by English rock singer-songwriter David Bowie. It was originally released by Mercury Records in the United States in November 1970, and in April 1971, with different artwork, in the United Kingdom. The album was reissued by RCA Records in 1972 used a black-and-white picture of Ziggy Stardust as the artwork, but subsequent reissues since 1990 have used the original UK cover as the official artwork. The album was produced by Tony Visconti and recorded at Trident Studios and Advision Studios in London. Following the largely acoustic and folk rock sound of his previous 1969 self-titled album, The Man Who Sold the World marked a shift toward hard rock. The lyrics are also darker than his previous releases, exploring themes of insanity, religious themes, technology, and war commentary. None of the songs from the album were released as official singles, although some tracks appeared as B-sides to other songs between 1970 and 1973. Upon release, The Man Who Sold the World performed well critically and commercially in the US but not as well in the UK. Retrospectively, the album has been praised for the band's performance and the unsettling nature
