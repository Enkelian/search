Osterley Park
Osterley Park is a large park and one of the largest open spaces in London. In its grounds, there is a large mansion which is often referred to as 'Osterley House'. The park lies between Osterley, Isleworth; Heston, Hounslow; Norwood Green, Southall, Hanwell, Ealing and Brentford, in the London Boroughs of Hounslow and Ealing. It is operated by the National Trust. When the house was built it was surrounded by countryside. It was one of a group of large houses close to London which served as country retreats for wealthy families. Other surviving country retreats of this type near London include Syon House and Chiswick House. The park is one of the largest open spaces in west London, although the M4 motorway cuts across the middle of it. History Elizabethan The original building on this site was a manor house built in the 1570s for banker Sir Thomas Gresham, who purchased the manor of Osterley in 1562. The "faire and stately brick house" was completed in 1576. It is known that Queen Elizabeth visited. The stable block from this period remains at Osterley Park. Gresham was so wealthy he also bought the neighbouring Manor of Boston in 1572. Child and
