Buzz (airline)
Buzz (styled as buzz) was a British low-cost airline operating services within Europe. It operated from 2000 until 2004 as a subsidiary of KLM and then Ryanair. History The airline was established in 1999 and started operations on 4 January 2000. It was launched by KLM as a sub-brand of KLM uk to compete with other low-cost carriers such as EasyJet, Go Fly and Ryanair by taking over many of the point-to-point routes of the former AirUK/KLM UK network. It started with 8 BAe 146-300 aircraft transferred from the KLM uk brand which retained the Amsterdam feeder routes (transferred to KLM Cityhopper in November 2002). This was shortly followed by two leased ex-Deutsche BA Boeing 737-300 aircraft. In late 2002, buzz leased from ILFC another 6 737-300s previously operated by Continental Airlines and the first 2 737s were returned to lessor Shananda in early 2003. Buzz also was the first low-cost airline trying to attract the high yield business travel segment, especially by promoting its flights to/from London Stansted to Frankfurt (international airport) and Düsseldorf. Buzz had a local commercial manager in Germany (2000–2003) who established the first direct contacts to corporates, TM's (Travel Managers) and TMC's (Travel Management Companies).
