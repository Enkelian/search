1991 Los Angeles Rams season
The 1991 Los Angeles Rams season was the team's 54th year with the National Football League and the 46th season in Los Angeles. The team was looking to improve on its 5-11 record from 1990. However, the Rams finished the 1991 season 3-13, tied for the second worst record in the NFL with the Cincinnati Bengals and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. After splitting their first 6 games, the Rams lost their final 10 games of the season, their longest losing streak to end a season since 1937, when the team was in Cleveland, when the team lost 9 in a row to end that season. The 3-13 record was the worst for the Rams in Los Angeles for a 16-game schedule and they tied the third-fewest posted by the team in its tenure in the city. This was also, at the time, the worst record for the Rams in a 16-game schedule overall (not including the 1982 strike-shortened season). The 1991 Rams' pass defense surrendered 7.86 yards-per-pass attempt (including quarterback sacks), the fourth-most in the history of the league.
