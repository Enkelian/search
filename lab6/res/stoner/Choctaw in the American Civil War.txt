Choctaw in the American Civil War
The Choctaw in the American Civil War participated in two major arenasâ€” the Trans-Mississippi and Western Theaters. The Trans-Mississippi had the Choctaw Nation. The Western had the Mississippi Choctaw. The Choctaw Nation had removed West prior to the War. But, the Mississippi Choctaw had elected to remain in the East. Both the Choctaw Nation and the Mississippi Choctaw would ultimately side with the Confederacy. After thirty years of development, the Choctaw Nation had begun to flourish in their new western environment. Their economic system was identical as the American South. Their upper class was engaged in the cotton trade with networks reaching as far as New Orleans. Confederate envoy Albert Pike successfully persuaded much of Indian country to side with the newly formed Confederate states. He conducted treaty terms and later commanded a combined force of Choctaw, Cherokee, Chickasaw, Creek, and Seminole troops. The Mississippi Choctaw led a tougher existence. Through treaty provisions, they elected to stay while the majority removed West. By the time of the Civil War, the Mississippi Choctaw were destitute and lived a sharecropper's existence.
