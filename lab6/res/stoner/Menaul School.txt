Menaul School
Menaul School is an independent sixth through twelfth grade day and boarding school in Albuquerque, New Mexico with a diverse, intellectual, personal, college preparatory education experience. Menaul School is accredited by the State of New Mexico, Independent Schools Association of the Southwest (ISAS) and North Central Association (NCA). The school has strong historical significance in New Mexico, and especially in Albuquerque, where Menaul Blvd. and many other locations have been named for the school. History Although the roots of Menaul School go back to 1881, when Rev. Sheldon Jackson, a Presbyterian minister, opened "The Pueblo Training School" (PTS) in Albuquerque, NM under a contract with the U.S. government, that did not mark the founding of Menaul School. Instead, it marked the establishment of Presbyterian-related education in Albuquerque. The PTS was originally located in the Duranes area, just north of Old Town in Albuquerque. In 1882, the government purchased 66.67 acres of land from citizens of Albuquerque. (This is the property at what is now Indian School Road and 12th Street.) In 1884, the school moved into buildings at that location. In 1886, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs did not renew the contract with the Presbyterians and took over the PTS
