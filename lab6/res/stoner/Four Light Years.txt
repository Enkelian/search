Four Light Years
Four Light Years is a box set of three studio albums by Electric Light Orchestra (ELO). It was released in 1980 by Jet Records. The box contained three albums: A New World Record (1976), the double album Out of the Blue (1977), and Discovery (1979). Each album was a large commercial success in its own right, but unlike Three Light Years it did not chart as a combined collection on the UK Albums Chart. The set was so-titled because it covered four years, contained four vinyl records, and was a sequel to Three Light Years (1978). A proposed Across the Border EP was meant to promote the box set but was withdrawn. The EP version of the song would later turn up on the 1997 singles compilation Light Years.
