My Boo (Usher and Alicia Keys song)
"My Boo" is a duet between American R&B singers Usher and Alicia Keys, written by Usher, Keys, Jermaine Dupri, Adonis Shropshire, and Manuel Seal. It was included on the re-release of Usher's fourth studio album, Confessions (2004). The song was released as the album's fourth single in 2004. Set over a hip hop-style track, it was produced by Dupri and No I.D. The song received positive reviews from critics, and has garnered awards. The single stayed on top of the Billboard Hot 100 for six weeks, making it the third most-successful single from the album after "Yeah!" and "Burn", respectively. It was also ranked as the 36th biggest song of the 2000â€“2009 decade in the United States. The song was later remade by the smooth jazz supergroup Urban Knights, which was fronted by pianist Ramsey Lewis. Background Usher and Alicia Keys had previously collaborated with the remix of Keys' 2004 single "If I Ain't Got You", which was released in the United Kingdom. During the production of Usher's fourth studio album, Confessions, they thought of various female singers to pair him with on the song. Usher and Kortney Kaycee Leveringston's rare demo version can be found floating on the Internet.
