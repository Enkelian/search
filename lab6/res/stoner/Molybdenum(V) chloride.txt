Molybdenum(V) chloride
Molybdenum(V) chloride is the inorganic compound with the formula [MoCl5]2. This dark volatile solid is used in research to prepare other molybdenum compounds. It is moisture-sensitive and soluble in chlorinated solvents. Usually called molybdenum pentachloride, it is in fact a dimer with the formula Mo2Cl10. Structure Each molybdenum has local octahedral symmetry and two chlorides bridge between the molybdenum centers. A similar structure is also found for the pentachlorides of W, Nb and Ta. In the gas phase and partly in solution, the dimers partially dissociates to give a monomeric pentahalide. The monomer is paramagnetic, with one unpaired electron per Mo center, reflecting the fact that the formal oxidation state is +5, leaving one valence electron on the metal center. Preparation and properties MoCl5 is prepared by chlorination of Mo metal but also chlorination of MoO3. The unstable hexachloride MoCl6 is not produced in this way.MoCl5 is reduced by acetonitrile to afford an orange complex, MoCl4(MeCN)2, which in turn reacts with THF to give MoCl4(THF)2, a precursor to other molybdenum-containing complexes.Molybdenum(IV) bromide is prepared by treatment of molybdenum(V) chloride with hydrogen bromide: 2 MoCl5 + 10 HBr â†’ 2 MoBr4 + 10 HCl + Br2The reaction proceeds via the unstable
