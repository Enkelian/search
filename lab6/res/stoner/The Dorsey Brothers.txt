The Dorsey Brothers
The Dorsey Brothers were an American studio jazz band, led by Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey. They started recording in 1928 for OKeh Records. History The Dorsey Brothers recorded songs for the dime store labels (Banner, Cameo, Domino, Jewel, Oriole, Perfect). A handful of sides during their Brunswick period were issued by Vocalion. They signed to Decca in 1934, formed a more traditional band, and performed live until a falling out in May 1935. Glenn Miller composed four songs for the Dorsey Brothers when he was a member in 1934 and 1935, "Annie's Cousin Fannie", "Dese Dem Dose", "Harlem Chapel Chimes", and "Tomorrow's Another Day".In 1935, the Dorsey Brothers Orchestra had two No. 1 recordings on Decca, including "Lullaby of Broadway" with Bob Crosby on vocals, topping the charts for two weeks and No. 1 for three weeks.Tommy Dorsey left the orchestra in 1935, ending the group as most band members either followed him or left. The Dorseys reunited on March 15, 1945 to record a V-Disc at Liederkranz Hall in New York City. Released in June 1945, the disc contained "More Than You Know" and "Brotherly Jump". The songs were performed by the combined orchestras of Jimmy and Tommy Dorsey.
