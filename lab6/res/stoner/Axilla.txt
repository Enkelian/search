Axilla
The axilla (also, armpit, underarm or oxter) is the area on the human body directly under the joint where the arm connects to the shoulder. It also contains many sweat glands. In humans, the formation of body odor happens mostly in the armpit. These odorant substances have been suggested by some to serve as pheromones, which play a role related to mating. However, this is a controversial topic within the scientific community. The underarm regions seem more important than the genital region for body odor, which may be related to human bipedalism. Structure Boundaries Anatomically, the boundaries of the axilla are: The lower posterior boundary is called the posterior axillary fold and this is a compound structure consisting of the latissimus dorsi and teres major muscles. It can descend after weight loss.The anterior boundary is called the anterior axillary fold and this is rounded in shape and formed by the lower border of the pectoralis major. Some sources also include the pectoralis minor. It can elongate after weight loss.The contents of the axilla include the axillary vein and artery, as well as the brachial plexus, lymph nodes and fat. The axilla is the space between the side of the thorax
