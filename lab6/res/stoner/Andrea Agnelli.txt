Andrea Agnelli
Andrea Agnelli (Italian pronunciation: [anˈdrɛːa aɲˈɲɛlli]; born 6 December 1975 in Turin) is an Italian businessman and chairman of Italian football club Juventus F.C. Since 2012, he has also served as Executive Member and Chairman of the European Club Association, and was also appointed to the UEFA Executive Committee since 2015. He is a member of the industrialist Agnelli family. He is also a board member of FIAT and Exor. Early life Agnelli is the son of late Juventus F.C. chairman and senator of the Italian Republic Umberto Agnelli, CEO of Fiat from 1970 to 1976, and Donna Allegra Caracciolo di Castagneto, first cousin of Marella Agnelli, born Donna Marella Caracciolo di Castagneto and daughter of Filippo Caracciolo, 8th Prince di Castagneto, 3rd Duke di Melito, and a hereditary Patrician of Naples (1903–1965). Marella, widow of Agnelli's uncle Gianni, and Allegra and, therefore, Andrea, are both members of an old Neapolitan noble family that hold the titles of Prince of Castagneto and Duke of Melito, among others. Andrea was the last male member of the family to carry the Agnelli surname until the birth of his son Giacomo. He studied at St Clare's in Oxford, England, and then at Bocconi
