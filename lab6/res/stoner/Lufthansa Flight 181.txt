Lufthansa Flight 181
Lufthansa Flight 181 was a Boeing 737â€“230 Adv aircraft named Landshut that was hijacked on 13 October 1977 by four members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, who called themselves Commando Martyr Halima. The objective of the hijacking was to secure the release of imprisoned Red Army Faction leaders. On 18 October the aircraft was stormed by the West German counter-terrorism group GSG 9 in Mogadishu, Somalia, and all 90 passengers rescued. The rescue operation was codenamed Feuerzauber (German term for "Fire Spell"). The hijacking is considered to be part of the German Autumn. In 2017 the German government purchased the aircraft involved (D-ABCE), and a complex logistic operation was set in motion to transport it back to Germany. Lufthansa Technik specialists flew to Brazil to disassemble the aircraft and fit the different parts in an Antonov An-124 cargo airplane and an accompanying Ilyushin Il-76. Since then, it was stored at a hangar near the Dornier museum in Friedrichshafen. It was planned that the aircraft be restored (cleaned, refurbished, repainted) and displayed in its original 1977 Lufthansa livery. The German government lost interest in the project, which was due to be completed by October 2022. Lufthansa crew
