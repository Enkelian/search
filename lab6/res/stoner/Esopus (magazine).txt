Esopus (magazine)
Esopus is a Brooklyn, New York–based annual arts and culture publication founded by Tod Lippy in 2003 and published by the Esopus Foundation Ltd., a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. Originally a semiannual publication, it switched to an annual format in 2013. Esopus has featured content from a wide variety of creative disciplines, including artists' projects, critical writing, fiction, poetry, visual essays, interviews, and music—all presented in an unmediated format, with minimal editorial framing and no advertising. Mission and history The primary objective of Esopus is to give artists a noncommercial forum in which to publish their work, while simultaneously offering readers the opportunity to access a wide range of cultural expression. Each issue of Esopus features six long-form artists' projects, commissioned from well-known figures such as Edward Ruscha, Jenny Holzer, Anish Kapoor, and Mickalene Thomas, as well as from emerging artists. These projects have taken the form of removable posters, booklets, inserts, and pop-up sculptures, and are often printed using specialty inks, varnishes, and paper stocks. Esopus has partnered with institutions such as The Museum of Modern Art Archives, the Magnum Photos Archive, and the New York Public Library to present continuing series that reproduce never-before-seen archival materials, often in facsimile.
