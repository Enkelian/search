In the mid-1990s he started his own Third Eye label, and went on to work with artists such as Muslimgauze, Alex Paterson, Soulfly, Junior Delgado, and Dub Syndicate.In the late 1990s, Bolloten converted to Islam, and his music took on an increasingly spiritual quality.His 2002 album New Testament featured guest vocals from Sandeeno, U Brown, Earl 16, Mike Brooks, and Daddy Freddy.
