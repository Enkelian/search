Hide Away
"Hide Away" or "Hideaway" is a blues guitar instrumental that has become "a standard for countless blues and rock musicians performing today". First recorded in 1960 by Freddie King, the song became a hit on the record charts. It has been interpreted and recorded by numerous blues and other musicians and has been recognized by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Grammy Hall of Fame. Origins "Hide Away" is credited to Freddie King and Sonny Thompson (pianist and A&R man at Federal Records). However, in an interview, Freddie King stated that "Hide Away" came from a Hound Dog Taylor song called "Taylor's Boogie". Shakey Jake Harris, a harmonica player who played with Magic Sam, recalled: At that time me and Sam was playing at Mel's Hideaway [Mel's Hide Away Lounge, a Chicago blues club where many of the blues musicians of the era played]. That's where Freddie King's 'Hide Away' comes from. We stole it from Hound Dog Taylor, and Freddie King stole it from us. It used to be our theme song. It was Magic Sam's theme song. And so Freddie King would come in and jam with us until he learnt that song. Magic Sam
