Euralair
Euralair was a charter airline based in France. Euralair was founded in 1964 as an air-taxi and executive charter company. In 1966 it became charter airline and operated its first charter flights in 1968 when it received the first Fokker F-27 (F-BRHL) on November 11, 1968 and the second (F-BRQL) on October 15, 1969; the last one sold to the Swiss company Belair (as HB-AAZ) in June 1973. In order to develop its charter activity, on November 1971 Euralair bought from Austrian Airline the first Sud Aviation Caravelle VIR (F-BSEL) and in 1973 the second (F-BTDL). In the 1990s Euralair was equipped with Boeing 737 aircraft. In 2002 services were started to West Africa with an Airbus A310. However, in November 2003 Euralair had to file for bankruptcy protection. The airline was saved from liquidation by a last-minute takeover offer from UK-based Angel Gate Aviation. Euralair was restarted as Air Horizons in February 2004. References External links Euralair History Euralair Former Fleet Detail Euralair Boeing 737 in Mauritania
