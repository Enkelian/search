Fakelaki
Fakelaki or fakellaki is the phonetic transliteration of the Greek word φακελάκι. It means "little envelope" but is also used in Greek popular culture as a jargon term referring to the bribery of public servants and private companies by Greek citizens in order to "expedite" service. According to this practice, sums of money are stuffed in files and passed across the desk to secure appointments, documents approval and permits. Dynamics The Greek term "fakelaki" is close to the notion of tip in meaning, but at the same time it may refer to specific tariffs demanded by government officials in order to bypass procedure. As of mid-2011, one in four employed Greeks worked for the government.Fakelaki is also connected to a work-culture that perceives the various documents issued by authorities (for example a driving license) as "papers" you need to pay a price in order "to buy". Fakelaki is illegal, but its continuing presence in Greek life remains a problem. Extent of fakelaki Transparency International, an independent corruption monitoring NGO, found that 13% of Greeks paid fakelaki (bribery in the form of envelopes with cash donations) in 2009, which was estimated to account for €787 million in yearly corruption payments.
