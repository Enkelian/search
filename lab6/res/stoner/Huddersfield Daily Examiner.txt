Huddersfield Daily Examiner
The Huddersfield Daily Examiner is an English local daily evening newspaper covering news and sport from Huddersfield and its surrounding areas. History The first edition was published as a weekly, starting on 6 September 1851, as the Huddersfield & Holmfirth Examiner, although the 'Holmfirth' was dropped from the title two years later. The newspaper has been published as a daily since 28 January 1871 when journalists on the title worked all weekend in order to forestall a rival and become the town's first daily paper. Since 1999 it has been part of the Trinity Mirror group, which is now known as Reach plc and is the largest newspaper publisher in the United Kingdom. The Examiner lays claim to a notable first in regional British journalism, as the first provincial UK newspaper to employ a woman journalist, in 1888. Recent developments Examiner journalist Adrian Sudbury was given recognition during his battle with terminal leukaemia between 2006 and 2008. His 'Sign up for Sudders' campaign was aimed at encouraging more people to sign up as bone marrow donors, and education packs about blood, bone marrow and organ donation were sent out to schools across the country. Sudbury died at his family home
