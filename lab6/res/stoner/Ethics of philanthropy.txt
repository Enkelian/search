Ethics of philanthropy
Philanthropy poses a number of ethical issues: How donors should choose beneficiaries and ensure that their donations are effective. Acceptable marketing practices for grant seekers. A recipient may violate the donor's intent in spirit or in law. A donor's activities may be considered incompatible with those of the institution's mission. Specifically, a recipient may be perceived as complicit with or oblivious to a donor's unethical practices, thus tainting its own good name, especially when an institution grants naming rights. A donor may receive a quid pro quo for all or part of a donation. Giving effectively Choosing suitable recipients of philanthropy, and ensuring that the aid is effective, is a difficult ethical problem, first addressed by Aristotle. Marketing practices Ethical questions include: how to compensate fund-raising agents; how to compete with other causes; how much deception, if any, is acceptable; whether some images ("pornography of poverty") should not be used, even if they are effective. Donor intent Many gifts are accompanied by a statement of intent, which may be a formal, legal agreement, or a less formal understanding. To what extent the recipient must respect that intent is an ethical and legal issue, especially as circumstances and social norms change.
