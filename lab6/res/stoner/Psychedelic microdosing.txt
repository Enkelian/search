Psychedelic microdosing
Psychedelic microdosing is the practice of using sub-threshold doses (microdoses) of serotonergic psychedelic drugs in an attempt to improve creativity, boost physical energy level, emotional balance, increase performance on problems-solving tasks and to treat anxiety, depression and addiction. The practice of microdosing has become more widespread in the 21st century with more people claiming long-term benefits from the practice. Techniques The two most common psychedelic drugs used in microdosing are Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and Psilocybin (psychoactive mushrooms). Other psychedelics that have been used for microdosing include mescaline, 4-HO-MET, 2,5-Dimethoxy-4-bromoamphetamine, 2C-H, 2C-D, 2C-E and lysergic acid amide. A microdose is usually 1/10 to 1/20 of an active dose of a psychedelic drug.In contrast to the recreational use of psychedelics, individuals who microdose stick to strict drug schedules, often dosing about every 3 days, and do not observe any impairment to their normal functioning. In a study that evaluated the effects of three different doses of LSD on healthy human volunteers, it was concluded that the threshold dose of LSD that would affect normal functioning is 13 ug. Doses lower than this are considered appropriate for microdosing with LSD. Prevalence and Demographics Both gender and education have an effect on the
