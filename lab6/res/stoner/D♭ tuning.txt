D♭ tuning
D♭ tuning, also called C♯ tuning, is an alternative guitar tuning. Each string is one and one half steps lower than in standard tuning, or one half step lower than D tuning. The resulting notes can be described as D♭-G♭-B-E-A♭-D♭ or (less often) as C♯-F♯-B-E-G♯-C♯. "Extremely slack," it is very popular amongst alternative and heavy rock bands because it has a darker and lower-pitched sound compared to E standard. Used by A Pale Horse Named Death A Perfect Circle - nearly all of their songs are in this tuning. Abbath (album only; live performances are on D tuning) Akercocke Al's Band (on "My Bologna" and "Perform This Way") All That Remains (since Overcome and live performances since 2007) The Almighty Amorphis (on Tales from the Thousand Lakes) An Isle Ate Her Anata Architects (they also drop the low string to G♯/A♭) Before the Dawn (on the song "The Black" from 4:17 am) Behemoth Between the Buried and Me - nearly all of their songs are in this tuning. Black Sabbath - many songs from Master of Reality onward to at least Sabotage (because Tony Iommi had two damaged fingertips). They still use this tuning on some songs from later albums
