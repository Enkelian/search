Frost Bank
Frost Bank is a Texas-chartered bank based in San Antonio with 134 branches and 1,300 automated teller machines, all in Texas. It is the primary subsidiary of Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc., a bank holding company. It is on the list of largest banks in the United States. History Early years Frost Bank was founded in 1868 as a mercantile partnership in San Antonio by Thomas Claiborne Frost, who had served as a lieutenant colonel in the Confederate States Army. In February 1899, it was chartered as a national banking association. That year, the bank also reached $1 million in deposits. The bank survived the Panic of 1907 with the aid of an association of local banks and by 1921, sold shares to outside investors for the first time. Frost continued to grow with construction of a 12-story building in 1921, which was the tallest building in Texas at the time. By 1926, Joseph Hardin Frost, brother of T.C. Frost Jr., took over as president of the company. Growth Over the years, Frost has grown both organically and through acquisition of other banks, beginning in 1928 with the purchase of Lockwood National Bank.. In 1977, the company merged with Cullen Bankers, Inc.
