Chlorine monofluoride
Chlorine monofluoride is a volatile interhalogen compound with the chemical formula ClF. It is a colourless gas at room temperature and is stable even at high temperatures. When cooled to −100 °C, ClF condenses as a pale yellow liquid. Many of its properties are intermediate between its parent halogens, Cl2 and F2. Reactivity Chlorine monofluoride is a versatile fluorinating agent, converting metals and non-metals to their fluorides and releasing Cl2 in the process. For example, it converts tungsten to tungsten hexafluoride and selenium to selenium tetrafluoride: W + 6 ClF → WF6 + 3 Cl2 Se + 4 ClF → SeF4 + 2 Cl2ClF can also chlorofluorinate compounds, either by addition across a multiple bond or via oxidation. For example, it adds fluorine and chlorine to the carbon of carbon monoxide, yielding carbonyl chloride fluoride: CO + ClF → See also Chlorine fluorides References External links National Pollutant Inventory - Fluoride and compounds fact sheet WebBook page for ClF
