Hunky Dory
Hunky Dory is the fourth studio album by English singer-songwriter David Bowie, released on 17 December 1971 by RCA Records. It was his first release through RCA, which would be his label for the next decade. Following the hard rock sound of The Man Who Sold the World, Hunky Dory marked a move towards art rock and art pop styles. Co-produced by Ken Scott and Bowie himself, it was recorded in mid-1971 at Trident Studios in London and featured Rick Wakeman on piano and the musicians who would later be known as the Spiders from Mars â€“ comprising Mick Ronson, Trevor Bolder and Mick Woodmansey. The album cover, photographed by Brian Ward and airbrushed by Terry Pastor, was influenced by a Marlene Dietrich photo book that Bowie took with him to the photoshoot.The album was initially released to favourable critical and commercial reception but wasn't a major success until the commercial breakthrough of his following album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972). It was supported by the singles "Changes" in 1972 and "Life on Mars?" in 1973. Retrospectively, Hunky Dory has received critical acclaim and is regarded as one of Bowie's best works.
