Used To Love Her
"Used to Love Her" is a song by American rock band Guns N' Roses from the album G N' R Lies. The song was used as a B-side on some releases of the "Paradise City" single. Background Contrary to popular belief that the song is about a girlfriend of Axl Rose, the song was written as a joke. Izzy Stradlin stated, "I was sitting around listening to the radio and some guy was whining about a broad who was treating him bad. I wanted to take the radio and smash it against the wall. Such self-pity! What a wimp! So we rewrote the same song we heard with a better ending." Slash perversely quipped, "People think it's about one of our old girlfriends, but it's actually about Axl's dog." Live Performances The band debuted the song live at CBGB in October 1987, during the Appetite for Destruction Tour. The song has been a live staple at Guns N' Roses concerts. After last being played with the previous lineup in 1993, the song re-debuted in 2006 during the Chinese Democracy Tour. It was played at every tour since, being played by the reunited lineup in 2016 during the Not In This
