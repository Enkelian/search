Suspensory ligament of eyeball
The suspensory ligament of eyeball (or Lockwood's ligament) forms a hammock stretching below the eyeball between the medial and lateral check ligaments and enclosing the inferior rectus and inferior oblique muscles of the eye. It is a thickening of Tenon's capsule, the dense connective tissue capsule surrounding the globe and separating it from orbital fat.The ligament functions to support the eye, and prevents downward displacement of the eyeball. It can be considered a part of the bulbar sheath.It is named for Charles Barrett Lockwood. == References ==
