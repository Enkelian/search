Preacher Man
"Preacher Man" is a song recorded by English girl group Bananarama. It appears on the group's fifth studio album Pop Life and was released as the album's second single. The track was co-written and produced by Youth with additional production and remix by Shep Pettibone. "Tripping on Your Love" had been originally slated as the second single from the album, and some promotional singles of the song were sent to radio stations in late 1990. Around this time, group member Sara Dallin contracted meningitis, which delayed the release of the single some months. When she recovered, London Records decided "Preacher Man" was a better choice for a single and so it was released in December 1990. "Tripping on Your Love" was eventually released as the album's fourth single. The pop/dance tune became the highest-charting and biggest-selling single released from the Pop Life album, climbing to number 20 in the UK singles chart. The single was Bananarama's last appearance in the UK top 20 until "Move in My Direction" in 2005. In Australia, the single peaked at #147 on the Australian ARIA singles chart. "Preacher Man" was not released in the United States. The song was performed on The Original Line
