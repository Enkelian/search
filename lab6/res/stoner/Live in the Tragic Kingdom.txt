Background No Doubt released their eponymous debut studio album in 1992, one year after being signed to Interscope Records. The album was commercially unsuccessful, selling 30,000 copies. Interscope did not trust that the band would fund a second album, and paired them with producer Matthew Wilder. Keyboardist Eric Stefani was distressed by the band's lack of success, and the fact that he had to give up creative control to someone outside the band; he soon left the band in late 1994 to pursue an animation career on the animated sitcom The Simpsons. No Doubt released and recorded their second studio album, The Beacon Street Collection,
