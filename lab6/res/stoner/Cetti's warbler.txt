Cetti's warbler
Cetti's warbler , Cettia cetti, is an Old World warbler. It is a small, brown bush-warbler which breeds in southern and central Europe, north-west Africa and the east Palearctic as far as Afghanistan and north-west Pakistan. The bird is named after the 18th century Italian zoologist, Francesco Cetti. This species is very difficult to see because of its skulking habits. Population The number of Cetti's warblers has greatly increased across Europe since 1990. The current population of Cetti's warblers in Europe is estimated to be about 600,000-1,600,000 breeding pairs. The populations in Italy and Turkey are known to be stable or increasing. The exception to the general positive European population trend is Greece, where the population decreased slightly between 1990 and 2000. However, overall, Cetti's warblers are evaluated as secure. The Cetti's warbler was first recorded in the United Kingdom in 1961. The UK population of Cetti's warblers fell by over a third between 1984 and 1986. However, populations in milder regions continued to grow. Description The Cetti's warbler is approximately 13–14 cm (5.1–5.5 in) from bill to tail. The male weighs 15 g (0.53 oz) and the female 12 g (0.42 oz). Cetti's warblers have a rounded head with
