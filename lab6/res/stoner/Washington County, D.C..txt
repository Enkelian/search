Washington County, D.C.
The County of Washington was one of five original political entities within the District of Columbia, the capital of the United States. Formed by the Organic Act of 1801 from parts of Montgomery and Prince George's County, Maryland, Washington County referred to all unincorporated parts of the District of Columbia "on the east side of the Potomac, together with the islands therein." The bed of the Potomac River was considered to be part of Washington County as well.Originally Alexandria County, D.C. and the City of Alexandria formed the portion of the District west of the Potomac, ceded by the commonwealth of Virginia. Those sections were returned to Virginia by Congress in 1846, leaving the District with three components: the City of Washington, Georgetown, and rural Washington County. Upon the passage of the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1871, those three subdivisions were unified under a single District government and made coterminous, ending Washington County's separate identity. Government Starting in 1801, Washington County was governed by a board of commissioners, or a levy court, made up all of the Justices of the Peace, or magistrates, of the county appointed by the President and the number of those were not fixed.
