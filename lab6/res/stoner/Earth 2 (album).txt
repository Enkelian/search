Earth 2 (album)
Earth 2: Special Low Frequency Version, also known as simply Earth 2, is the first full-length studio album by the drone metal band Earth. Produced by Earth and Stuart Hallerman, it was released on February 5, 1993, on Sub Pop Records. The album was influential in the development of drone music and drone metal genres.

He added: "Earth 2 dedicates itself to the proposition that there's no such thing as too loud, trudging, or doom-laden." while describing the closing track as "ambient music completely and totally suffused with threat and fuzz."Alan Licht, in his third list of minimalist classics, wrote
