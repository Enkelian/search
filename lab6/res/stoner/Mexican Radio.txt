"Mexican Radio" is a song by American new wave band Wall of Voodoo. Produced by Richard Mazda, the track was initially released on their 1982 album Call of the West and was released as a single in early 1983. With regular airplay on MTV in their native United States, the song had moderate commercial success, peaking at #58 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It did better in other parts of the world, peaking at #18 in Canada, #21 in New Zealand and #33 in Australia. It also reached #64 in the UK. Background Wall of Voodoo frontman Stan Ridgway and guitarist Marc Moreland cited listening to high-wattage unregulated AM Mexican radio stations (among them XERF, XEG, and XERB) as the inspiration for the song.Moreland was the first to begin writing the song. In a recorded interview in the 1990s, he stated, "It was basically just me singing 'I'm on a Mexican radio' over and over again". Moreland added that, when he played it for his mother, she hated it because of his repetitious lyrics. Ridgway collaborated with Moreland to finish the song, adding all the verse lyrics to Moreland's chorus and guitar lick, as well as the "mariachi" harmonica
