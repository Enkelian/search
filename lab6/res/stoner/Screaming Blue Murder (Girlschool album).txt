Screaming Blue Murder (Girlschool album)
Screaming Blue Murder is the third studio album by British heavy metal band, Girlschool. It was released on Bronze Records in 1982, and featured one line-up change in bassist Ghislaine 'Gil' Weston, formerly of The Killjoys, replacing the recently departed founding-member Enid Williams. Nigel Gray, who had previously worked with The Police, produced the album. The original vinyl issue had the lyrics printed on the inner-sleeve, although in the UK initial copies were accidentally shipped with a plain, generic liner. Rock-magazine Kerrang! relayed, from Bronze Records, the advice to write to the label in order that they could post the missing lyric-bag by return. The UK-release was somewhat delayed, and the band had already started their 20-date UK tour, which ran through May 1982. Castle Music issued what is considered the definitive edition of the CD 14 June 2004, adding eleven bonus tracks and extensive sleevenotes by Record Collector magazine's Joe Geesin. The album had previously been issued on a 2-on-1 CD in the UK, coupled with Play Dirty; that release (LOMA CD4) featured no bonus material.
