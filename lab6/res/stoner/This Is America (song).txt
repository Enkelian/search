"This Is America" is a song by American rapper Donald Glover, under his musical stage name Childish Gambino. Written by Glover, Ludwig Göransson, and Jeffery Lamar Williams, and produced by Glover and Göransson, it was released on May 5, 2018, at the same time that Gambino was hosting an episode of Saturday Night Live.

The song's accompanying music video was directed by filmmaker Hiro Murai, a frequent Gambino collaborator.

It has also topped the charts in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand.
