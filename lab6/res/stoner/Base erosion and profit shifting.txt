Base erosion and profit shifting
Base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) refers to corporate tax planning strategies used by multinationals to "shift" profits from higher-tax jurisdictions to lower-tax jurisdictions, thus "eroding" the "tax-base" of the higher-tax jurisdictions.The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) define BEPS strategies as also "exploiting gaps and mismatches in tax rules"; however, academics proved corporate tax havens (such as Ireland, the Caribbean, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Singapore, Switzerland, and Hong Kong), who are the largest global BEPS hubs, use OECD–whitelisted tax structures and OECD–compliant BEPS tools.Corporate tax havens offer BEPS tools to "shift" profits to the haven, and additional BEPS tools to avoid paying taxes within the haven (e.g. Ireland's "CAIA tool"). BEPS tools are associated mostly with U.S. technology and life science multinationals. Tax academics showed use of the BEPS tools by U.S. multinationals, via tax havens, maximised long–term U.S. exchequer receipts and shareholder return, at the expense of others. Scale In January 2017, the OECD estimated that BEPS tools are responsible for tax losses of circa $100–240 billion per annum. In June 2018, an investigation by tax academic Gabriel Zucman (et alia), estimated that the figure is closer to $200 billion per annum. The Tax Justice Network estimated that
