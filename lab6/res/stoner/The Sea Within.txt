The Sea Within
The Sea Within are an international rock supergroup formed in 2017 by Swedish guitarist and singer-songwriter Roine Stolt, bassist Jonas Reingold and guitarist Daniel Gildenl√∂w, German drummer Marco Minnemann, and American keyboardist Tom Brislin. Their self-titled debut album was released on 22 June 2018. History The band's formation was first announced in December 2017. Stolt recalled that the German-based independent record label Inside Out Music first suggested the idea of establishing a new band with strong songwriters. By the time of their announcement, their debut album was nearing completion. The group had gathered in north London to record at Livingston Studios which marked the first time the five had been in the same room together. Stolt realised such a risk would affect the music, but the experience turned into a successful and productive one after almost two hours of music was developed collectively and recorded. Stolt said their direction includes elements of progressive and art rock combined with pop and cinematic music. The album is scheduled for release on Inside Out Records on 22 June 2018, which will be supported by their debut live gig at the Night of the Prog XIII festival in Lorelei, Germany, on 14 July 2018.Their
