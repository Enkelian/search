Live Phish 04.02.98
Live Phish 04.02.98 is the first night of the four-night "Island Tour," recorded live at the Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, New York, on April 2, 1998. The short mini-run quickly became one of the most popular Phish performances of all time, with the band mixing the funk of 1997 with the high-energy jams of the mid-1990s along with brand new compositions. Highlights include a 20-minute "Stash", an 18-minute "Twist", "Wolfman's Brother" -> "Sneakin' Sally Through the Alley", and the debut of "Frankie Says" and "Birds of a Feather". In addition to being a CD release, this concert is available as a download in FLAC and MP3 formats at LivePhish.com.
