Dirty Fingers
Dirty Fingers is the third solo studio album by Irish guitarist Gary Moore. It was recorded in 1981, shortly after Moore disbanded his G-Force project, but was not released until 1983, and even then only in Japan, where Moore was very popular. It finally saw a European release in 1984. The album contains a cover of the song "Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood". The track "Nuclear Attack", written by Moore, had previously appeared on Greg Lake's eponymous debut album, on which Moore played guitar.
