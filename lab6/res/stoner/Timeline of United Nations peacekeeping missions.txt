Timeline of United Nations peacekeeping missions
The United Nations has authorized 71 peacekeeping operations as of April 2018. These do not include interventions authorized by the UN like the Korean War and the Gulf War. The 1990s saw the most UN peacekeeping operations to date. Peacekeeping operations are overseen by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) and share some common characteristics, namely the inclusion of a military or police component, often with an authorization for use of force under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. Peacekeeping operations are distinct from special political missions (SPMs), which are overseen by the Department of Political Affairs (DPA). SPMs are not included in the table below. 1940s 1950s 1960s 1970s 1980s 1990s 2000s 2010s See also League of Nations, predecessor of the United Nations History of United Nations peacekeeping List of UN peacekeeping missions List of countries where UN peacekeepers are currently deployed External links UN peacekeeping website
