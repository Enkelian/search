Lazycame
Lazycame is the stage name and performing name of Scottish singer-songwriter William Reid. Reid began performing as Lazycame after the breakup of the Jesus and Mary Chain, in which he played guitar and occasionally sang, in 1999.Critical reaction to Lazycame was mixed, but largely positive, with the NME describing the 1999 debut album as "a sometimes harrowing exercise in catharsis", and the 2000 EP Yawn as "easily the best thing William Reid has touched in years".
