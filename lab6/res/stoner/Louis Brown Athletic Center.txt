Louis Brown Athletic Center
The Rutgers Athletic Center, more commonly known as the RAC, is an 8,000-seat multi-purpose arena in Piscataway, New Jersey on Rutgers University's Livingston Campus. The building is shaped like a truncated tent with trapezoidal sides on the north and south ends. It is home to the men's and women's Rutgers Scarlet Knights basketball teams as well as the wrestling and gymnastic teams. Previously, the University used the 3,200-seat College Avenue Gym from 1931 to 1977. History The arena opened on November 30, 1977 with a win against rival Seton Hall. The arena was known as the Rutgers Athletic Center until 1986, when it was renamed for Louis Brown, a Rutgers graduate and former member of the varsity golf team, who made a large bequest to the University in his will. Despite the name change, the building was still largely referred to as "The RAC" (pronounced "rack") by students, alumni, fans, and players. In 2019, all references to Louis Brown were quietly removed from the arena and all University websites. Following this, all university publications have begun using the arena's original name, "The Rutgers Athletic Center." Reputation The RAC is renowned for being one of the loudest arenas in college basketball
