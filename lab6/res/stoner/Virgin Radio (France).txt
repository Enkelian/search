Virgin Radio (France)
Virgin Radio is a French network of FM radio stations dedicated to Rock and Pop music, operating on 250 different frequencies across France. Its musical programming is closely related to the American Hot Adult Contemporary format. The network was known as Europe 2 (as the contemporary music sister of Europe 1) until 1 January 2008, when it was rebranded as Virgin Radio. The station capital does not in fact belong to Virgin Group, but to Lagardère Active, which has to pay 0.5 to 1% of its profits to Virgin Group under a franchise contract. Virgin Radio claims approximately 3 million listeners every day.Because of the decline of the station's listening figures, Virgin Radio gave up playing rock music in 2011 to become a hit music station with a former Europe 2 slogan, "Un maxx de tubes".
