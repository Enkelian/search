History Performances of operas, ballet and plays in Stuttgart took place from the 17th century at the hall of Neues Lusthaus statt. The probably first opera production was in 1660 the singspiel Der Raub der Proserpina by Hofkapellmeister Samuel Capricornus. Four years later, a permanent stage was established. In 1750, the building was remodeled as Stuttgart's opera house, named Königliches Hoftheater (Roayal Court Theatre) in 1811. It burnt down in 1902, and opera was performed in a provisional Interimstheater.Today's opera house was built from 1909 to 1912 by architect Max Littmann from Munich, with two halls, Großes Haus and Kleines Haus. After the end of the monarchy in 1918, the theatres were named Württembergische Landestheater. The Kleines Haus, site of the world premiere of the first version of Ariadne auf Naxos by Richard Strauss, was destroyed in World War II.Staatsoper Stuttgart forms part of the Staatstheater Stuttgart, a three-branch theatre organisation for opera, play and Stuttgart Ballet.
