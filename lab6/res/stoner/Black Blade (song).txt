Black Blade (song)
"Black Blade" is a song by American rock band Blue Öyster Cult. The lyrics were written by Eric Bloom and British science fiction writer Michael Moorcock from the viewpoint of Elric, Moorcock's most famous character. Despite failing to chart, the song received significant airplay on rock radio stations. Background Elric wields a sentient, soul-sucking sword named Stormbringer. Aside from a set of cryptic, blood-red runes on the blade, the sword is black, hence the name "Black Blade". The music was jointly composed by Eric Bloom, lead singer of Blue Öyster Cult, and bass-player John Trivers. The song is the opening track on the Blue Öyster Cult album Cultösaurus Erectus.When asked how he got in touch with Moorcock for the song, Bloom said, "I went out of my way to send him a Fan Boy letter. He was living in England and came over to America, to meet with his publisher. He said, 'Let's get together.' We got together, bonded and he started sending me lyrics. That's how "Black Blade," "Veteran of Psychic Wars" and "Great Sun Jester" happened.In 2005, on the compilation "Day Late, Dollar Short," there's a cover of the song by the experimental metal band Thrones.
