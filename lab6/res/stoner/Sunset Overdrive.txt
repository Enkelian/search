Sunset Overdrive
Sunset Overdrive is an action-adventure shooter video game developed by Insomniac Games and published by Microsoft Studios. It was announced at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2013, and released worldwide for Xbox One in October 2014 and for Microsoft Windows in November 2018, with the Microsoft Windows version being published by THQ Nordic. The game is set in 2027, in a fictional metropolis called Sunset City. The player controls an employee of FizzCo, who has to fight off the OD, short for Overcharge Drinkers: humans who have turned into mutants after drinking FizzCo's energy drink beverage. In the dystopian Sunset City, the player character can wall-run, use zip-lines, and grind rails to swiftly navigate through it, with a large arsenal of weapons to use. The game also has a cooperative multiplayer mode called Chaos Squad, which tasks players to complete a series of missions with seven players. As the game puts emphasis on momentum, the game does not feature any cover system. The development of the game began in 2010 when Insomniac completed Resistance 3. After the project was green-lit internally, the studio partnered with Microsoft Studios, which helped fund the game and allowed Insomniac to keep the rights to the franchise.
