Flemish Eye
Flemish Eye is a record label started in 2003 in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The first release was Infiniheart by Chad VanGaalen, which was picked up in 2005 by indie label Sub Pop. From the success of Infiniheart, the label has earnestly developed a mandate of assisting Calgary-based musicians and artists. Since 2003, Flemish Eye has released 9 albums and is still actively growing its roster. Through the release of Women's self-titled album, the label has also developed a working relationship with Bloomington, Indiana based independent label Jagjaguwar. The label was referred to by CMJ New Music Monthly as a "micro-indie". The name Flemish Eye originates from the type of fishing knot by this name, used when attaching hooks, rings and swivels to wire, but can also be used to rig a loop on heavy mono line.
