Great Portland Street
Great Portland Street in the West End of London links Oxford Street with Albany Street and the A501 Marylebone Road and Euston Road. A commercial street including some embassies, it divides Fitzrovia, to the east, from Marylebone to the west. It delinates areas with contrasting identities, the west at strongest in grandiose Portland Place and Harley Street, the east at strongest in artists' and independent businesses of Fitzrovia. The street has its own unique character, due in part of the unusual combination of small shops combined with its strongly rectilinear character. Electorally it is split between the City of Westminster's Marylebone High Street and West End wards. Overview Long sections of Great Portland Street are in two Westminster City Council conservation areas, named after Harley Street and East Marylebone. It was gradually developed by a senior branch of the Cavendish-Bentinck family, the Dukes of Portland, who owned most of the eastern half of Marylebone in the 18th and 19th centuries. It was first rated as John Street in 1726. A campaign to add to its trees began in 2009. Historic influences Different owners and interests influenced development; these shaped the street's layout and character. Edward Harley â€“ Earl of Oxford
