Griggs University
Griggs International Academy is an accredited Seventh-day Adventist distance learning school, offering courses from preschool to 12th grade. History Founded in 1909 as "The Fireside Correspondence School" and later known as the "Home Study Institute", the school began offering education to those who could not attend traditional schools. Classes were offered from the Seventh-Day Adventist Church headquarters in Washington, D.C., which moved to Silver Spring, Maryland, in the early 20th century. After that, the name was changed to "Home Study International". In July 2011, the school moved to the campus of Andrews University in Berrien Springs, Michigan. It changed its name to Griggs and split into Griggs University (for college courses) and Griggs International Academy (for K-12). Today, more than 235,000 people have studied with Griggs. In 2013, the five bachelor's degrees offered by Griggs University (Religion, Cross-cultural Relations, Human Organization & Behavior, Personal Ministries, and Humanities) were merged into Andrews University's School of Distance Education.
