Perestroika (; Russian: Перестройка, IPA: [pʲɪrʲɪˈstrojkə] (listen)) was a political movement for reformation within the Communist Party of the Soviet Union during the 1980s and is widely associated with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and his glasnost (meaning "openness") policy reform. The literal meaning of perestroika is "restructuring", referring to the restructuring of the Soviet political and economic system. Perestroika is sometimes argued to be a significant cause of the revolutions of 1989 (referred to as counter-revolutions by the USSR's defenders, and color revolutions) and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, which marked the end of the Cold War. Origin and time Mikhail Gorbachev first used the term 'Perestroika' in a speech during his visit to the City of Tolyatti in 1986. Perestroika lasted from 1985 until 1991. Summary Perestroika allowed more independent actions from various ministries and introduced many market-like reforms. The alleged goal of perestroika, however, was not to end the command economy but rather to make socialism work more efficiently to better meet the needs of Soviet citizens by adopting elements of liberal economics. The process of implementing perestroika created shortages, political, social, and economic tensions within the Soviet Union and is often blamed for the political ascent
