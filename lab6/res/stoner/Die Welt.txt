Die Welt
Die Welt (English: "The World") is a German national daily newspaper, published as a broadsheet by Axel Springer SE. History Die Welt was founded in Hamburg in 1946 by the British occupying forces, aiming to provide a "quality newspaper" modelled on The Times. It originally carried news and British-viewpoint editorial content, but from 1947 it adopted a policy of providing two leading articles on major questions, one British and one German. The newspaper was bought by Axel Springer in 1953. The 1993 circulation of the paper was 209,677 copies. At its peak in the occupation period, it had a circulation of around a million.The modern paper takes a self-described "liberal cosmopolitan" position in editing, but Die Welt is generally considered to be conservative.The average circulation of Die Welt is currently about 180,000 (2016 ) and the paper can be obtained in more than 130 countries. Daily regional editions appear in Berlin and Hamburg, and in 2002 the paper experimented with a Bavarian edition. A daily regional supplement also appears in Bremen. The main editorial office is in Berlin, in conjunction with the Berliner Morgenpost. Die Welt is the flagship newspaper of the Axel Springer publishing group. Its leading competitors are
