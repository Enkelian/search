Grace (Jeff Buckley album)
Grace is the only studio album by Jeff Buckley, released on August 23, 1994. While the album initially had poor sales—peaking at number 149 in the U.S.—and received mixed reviews, it gradually acquired critical acclaim and commercial success and, as of 2007, had sold over 2 million copies worldwide and been cited by critics and listeners as one of the greatest albums of all time. An extended version of the album (subtitled "Legacy Edition") celebrating its tenth anniversary was released on August 23, 2004, and it peaked at number 44 in the UK. Grace re-entered the albums chart in Australia at number 44 for the week of January 29 to February 5, 2007, 13 years after its original release date. It is currently certified 7x platinum in Australia. Music Buckley's version of "Corpus Christi Carol" was based on a version by Janet Baker.

Critical reception and legacy Grace has been highly rated in magazines such as Q, in which readers voted Grace the 75th greatest album of all time in 1998; the same vote was taken again in
