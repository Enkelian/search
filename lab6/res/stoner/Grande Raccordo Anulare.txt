The GRA or Grande Raccordo Anulare (literally, "Great Ring Spur Route") is a toll-free, ring-shaped 68.2 kilometres (42.4 mi) long orbital motorway that encircles Rome. GRA is one of the most important roads in Rome, and traffic reaches 160,000 vehicles per day as of 2011. The GRA features 14 tunnels, with lengths varying from the 66 meters of Parco di Veio II tunnel to the 1,150 meters of the Appia Antica tunnel as well as eight rest areas. It has 42 junctions, with the Via Aurelia numbered 1 and the rest following clockwise. The motorway has always been toll-free.
