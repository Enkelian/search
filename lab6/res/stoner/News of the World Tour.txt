News of the World Tour
The News of the World Tour was a concert tour by the British rock band Queen, supporting their successful 1977 album News of the World. The tour spanned from 11 November 1977 to 13 May 1978 over three tour legs: North America, Europe, and The United Kingdom. Rehearsals for the tour took place at Shepperton Studios in October 1977. Overview Hot off the heels of the A Day at the Races Tour, the band retreated to Wessex Studios to record their sixth studio album, News of the World. A video shoot for the first single off the album, "We Are the Champions," was shot on 6 October 1977 at New London Theatre. Many people from the Queen Fan Club were privately invited to the event to fill up the theatre. After running through four takes of the video, the band played a short live set for the 900 person audience, which served as a warm-up gig for the tour in the coming month. The band then spent the last week of the month rehearsing for the tour, during which, News of the World was released (28 October 1977). Visually, their show has been revamped for this tour.
