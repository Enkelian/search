Bootleg Brewery
The Bootleg Brewery is a microbrewery in Wilyabrup, Western Australia, and is set on 30 hectares (74 acres) of land beside a lake. It was established by Tom Reynolds as a retirement project in 1994 at a time when just two other pub brewers existed in Western Australia. Today, with an annual production of 125,000 litres (2006), Bootleg produces a range of beers including several award-winning varieties which are sold on the domestic and international markets.Due to the fact Margaret River is more known for wine production, Bootleg Brewery claims to be "an oasis of beer in a desert of wine". The Bootleg Brewery has won a variety of medals from the Australian International Beer Awards over the years. The medals by beer are as follows: Sou' West Wheat: Bronze (1997, 2001-2004), Silver (2005, 2006) Tom's Brown Ale: Silver (2001, 2002, 2004, 2005) Settlers Pale Ale: Bronze (2003), Silver (2006) Raging Bull: Gold (1999, 2003, 2004), Silver (1997, 1998, 2002, 2005) Amber Light: Bronze (2002-2004) Wils Pils: Gold (2002, 2003), Silver (2002, 2004), Bronze (1997, 2001) See also Australian pub Beer in Australia List of breweries in Australia References Notes Bibliography External links Official website
