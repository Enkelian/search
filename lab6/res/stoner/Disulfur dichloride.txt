Disulfur dichloride
Disulfur dichloride is the inorganic compound of sulfur and chlorine with the formula S2Cl2.Some alternative names for this compound are sulfur monochloride (the name implied by its empirical formula, SCl), disulphur dichloride (British English Spelling) and sulphur monochloride (British English Spelling). S2Cl2 has the structure implied by the formula Cl−S−S−Cl, wherein the angle between the Cla−S−S and S−S−Clb planes is 90°. This structure is referred to as gauche, and is akin to that for H2O2. A rare isomer of S2Cl2 is S=SCl2; this isomer forms transiently when S2Cl2 is exposed to UV-radiation (see thiosulfoxides). Synthesis, basic properties, reactions Pure disulfur dichloride is a yellow liquid that "smokes" in moist air due to reaction with water. An idealized (but complicated) equation is: 16 S2Cl2 + 16 H2O → 8 SO2 + 32 HCl + 3 S8It is produced by partial chlorination of elemental sulfur. The reaction proceeds at usable rates at room temperature. In the laboratory, chlorine gas is led into a flask containing elemental sulfur. As disulfur dichloride is formed, the contents become a golden yellow liquid: S8 + 4 Cl2 → 4 S2Cl2 ΔH = −58.2 kJ/molExcess chlorine produces sulfur dichloride, which causes the liquid to become less yellow
