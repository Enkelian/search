Top of the Pops (magazine)
Top of the Pops magazine is a British monthly publication published by Immediate Media Company. It features chart information, star gossip, fashion and beauty advice, quizzes, song lyrics and posters. It was a supplementary magazine for the BBC television programme Top of the Pops, which stopped producing weekly shows in 2006. The magazine and TV show have since diverged and now have distinctive identities. The magazine was launched in February 1995 and is famous for giving girl group The Spice Girls their nicknames. Alongside a revamp of the TV show, it was originally marketed as the missing link between Smash Hits and NME, but its format was gradually changed, with less music content and a demographic shift to young girls. The title has had several editors over the years, including Peter Loraine, Corinna Shaffer and Rosalie Snaith, and contributing editors including Adam Tanswell. Its current editor is Peter Hart.
