North Wales Weekly News
The North Wales Weekly News is one of a group of newspapers published weekly in Llandudno. History The newspaper was first published on 14 February 1889 by local printer Robert Evans Jones as the Weekly News and Visitorsâ€™ Chronicle for Colwyn Bay, Colwyn, Llandrillo, Conway, Deganway and Neighbourhood, a four-page broadsheet which cost 1d. Jones' brother William built a new printworks in 1900 on Conwy Quay, where the Weekly News continued to be published until May 1972 when it moved to new purpose-built premises in Llandudno Junction; shortly afterwards it abandoned hot metal typesetting in favour of computerised printing; later technological developments allowed copy to be transmitted to the printworks from branch offices elsewhere in North Wales. In 1988, the Jones family sold the newspaper to Trinity International plc, with Robert Evans Jones' great-nephew remaining chairman of the new board, and in 2014 the paper celebrated its 125th anniversary.
