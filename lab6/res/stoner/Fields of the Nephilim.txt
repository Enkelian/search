Fields of the Nephilim
Fields of the Nephilim are an English gothic rock band formed in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, England in 1984. The band's name refers to a Biblical race of giants or angel-human hybrids, known as the Nephilim. The band’s look and seminal sound has proved highly influential, especially in the genre of gothic rock. Career Early years (1984–1991) Fields of the Nephilim's initial sound incorporated elements of hard rock, gothic rock, heavy metal, and psychedelic rock, and comprised a bass and guitar driven sound underpinned by McCoy's growled vocals. Lyrically, the band incorporated themes concerning magic (specifically chaos magic), the Cthulhu Mythos, the Sumerian religion, and the works of Aleister Crowley. The band had a "dust and death" image, associated with characters from Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns and often wore cowboy dusters with a weather-beaten look during photoshoots. This weather-beaten look was attained by dusting themselves down with, by their own admission, Mother's Pride flour. This also proved problematic for the band as in May 1988, Nottinghamshire Police detained the band whilst a suspect substance was tested for drugs. This was later determined to be nothing but flour from the stage set.Their debut EP, Burning the Fields, was released in 1985 by Situation
