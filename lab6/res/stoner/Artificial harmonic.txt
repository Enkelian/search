Artificial harmonic
To produce an artificial harmonic, a stringed instrument player holds down a note on the fingerboard or neck with one finger of their fretting hand (thereby shortening the vibrational length of the string) and uses another finger to lightly touch a point on the string that is an integer divisor of its vibrational length, and plucks or bows the side of the string that is closer to the bridge. This technique is used to produce harmonic tones that are otherwise inaccessible on the instrument. To guitar players, varieties of this technique are known as a pinch harmonic, tapped harmonic, and harp harmonic. "This gives both the electric and the acoustic guitar quite a bit of versatility and sonic flare [sic]." Artificial harmonics are produced by shifting the natural sectional parts of a string by means of the first finger, which, while being set, forms an artificial saddle, thereby shortening the string, and the fourth finger lightly touching the sectional parts of the shortened string. This technique, like natural harmonics, works by canceling out the fundamental tone and one or more partial tones by deadening their modes of vibration. See node. It is traditionally notated using three simultaneous noteheads in one
