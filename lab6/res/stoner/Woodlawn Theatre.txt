Woodlawn Theatre
The Woodlawn Theatre is located in San Antonio, Texas, and is one of the few theaters remaining designed by architect John Eberson. Eberson also designed the Majestic Theatre in San Antonio. The Woodlawn Theatre is designed in an art deco fashion, and was previously a prevalent movie theater, including hosting the world premiere of The Alamo in 1960. As of 2012, it is located in an area of San Antonio featuring buildings designed in art deco fashion known as the Deco District. History The Woodlawn Theatre opened August 17, 1945 as an elegant venue for Hollywood films. In 1960, John Wayne hosted the world premiere of his film The Alamo at the Woodlawn. It continued to be an active movie house through the 1960s and 1970s, and was purchased by Santikos Theatres in 1975, but it eventually was forced to shut down. The building remained vacant and slowly deteriorated for a number of years, falling through the hands of many tenants, mostly small theater groups. In 1979, an acting group known as San Antonio Theater Center was housed there. In 1986, the Woodlawn premiered the laser-show tribute to Pink Floyd, while hosting a series of jazz and blues concerts.
