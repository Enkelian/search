Greatest Hits (Blondie album)
Greatest Hits is a compilation album of recordings by the band Blondie released by EMI/Capitol Records in 2002. Overview Following the re-issue of the six original studio albums in 2001, this was the first Blondie "Best of" compilation to be digitally remastered, the first Blondie "Best of" to be officially sanctioned by the band for over 20 years, and also the first to include their comeback hit "Maria", a UK #1 in February 1999. Compiled by Capitol's Kevin Flaherty and London-based music journalist Steve Pafford, who also wrote the album sleeve notes, Greatest Hits features all of the tracks from the band's very first hits compilation, 1981's The Best of Blondie, including all four long-deleted 'special mixes' by producer Mike Chapman. Author Pafford was in the early stages of working with Debbie Harry on a lavish illustrated coffee table book entitled BlondieStyle (the sequel to his acclaimed BowieStyle, published by Omnibus Press), though as of 2010 the project is still on hold. The album charted at #38 on the UK's Top 75 Album Chart and charted for 4 weeks. In New Zealand the album reached #15 and charted for 8 weeks. As of August 9 2005 it has sold 85,000
