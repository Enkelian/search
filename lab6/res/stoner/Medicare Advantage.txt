Medicare Advantage
Medicare Advantage (sometimes called Medicare Part C or MA) is a type of health insurance plan in the United States that provides Medicare benefits through a private-sector health insurer. In a Medicare Advantage plan, a Medicare beneficiary pays a monthly premium to a private insurance company and receives coverage for inpatient hospital ("Part A") and outpatient ("Part B") services. Typically, the plan also includes prescription drug ("Part D") coverage. Many plans also offer additional benefits, such as dental coverage or gym memberships. By contrast, under so-called "Original Medicare", a Medicare beneficiary pays a monthly premium to the federal government and receives coverage for Part A and Part B services, but must purchase other coverage (e.g., for prescription drugs) separately.Most such plans are health maintenance organizations (HMOs) or preferred provider organizations (PPOs). Public Medicare Part C plans, including Medicare Advantage plans, finance at a minimum the same medical services as "Original" Parts A and B Medicare finance via FFS. Public Part C plans, including Medicare Advantage plans, also typically finance additional services, including additional health services; in 2019 extensive non-medical services such as assistance for daily living (ADL) services were added by many plan sponsors.
