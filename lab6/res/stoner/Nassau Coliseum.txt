Opened in 1972, the Coliseum occupies 63 acres (25 ha) of Mitchel Field, a former Army airfield, later an Air Force base. The facility is located in the Town of Hempstead, within the Uniondale 11553 ZIP code. The Coliseum is used for sporting events, concerts, large exhibitions and shows as well as trade showsâ€”44,000 square feet (4,100 m2) at the main arena, 60,000 at the Expo Center. In 2015, the arena was temporarily closed for a major renovation which was completed in April 2017. The New York Islanders of the National Hockey League (NHL) played at the Coliseum from 1972 to 2015 before moving to Brooklyn's Barclays Center. After the move proved to be commercially unsuccessful, the team split its home schedule between Barclays and the renovated Coliseum
