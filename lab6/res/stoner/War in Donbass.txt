War in Donbass
The War in Donbass is an ongoing armed conflict in the Donbass region of Ukraine. As the Euromaidan movement turned into the 2014 Ukrainian revolution and resulted in the removal of the Yanukovych government, concurrent Anti-Maidan and pro-Russian protests in some southern and south-eastern regions of Ukraine escalated into separatist movements. The parliament of Crimea started to take action towards separation of Crimea from Ukraine. Russian soldiers with no military insignia occupied key positions on the peninsula and ousted the Ukrainian military stationed there. Crimea declared independence in an internationally unrecognized referendum, which did however show overwhelming support for secession from Ukraine. Shortly after the independence, Crimea was annexed by the Russian Federation. In Donbass, the conflict between the separatists and the newly formed Ukrainian government escalated into open warfare. Two self-declared states were formed by the separatists: Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics. The extent of the Russian involvement in the conflict is contested. The official Russian position is that the conflict is primarily a civil war. Russian citizens participate in the conflict on the side of the rebels, but the Russian government says that their participation is not officially sanctioned.
