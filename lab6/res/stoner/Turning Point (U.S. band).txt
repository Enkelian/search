Turning Point (U.S. band)
Turning Point was an American straight edge hardcore punk band from New Jersey, United States, that existed from 1988 to 1991. Their early releases had the sound of youth crew, with lyrics relating to social issues or being straight edge. The later material was a lot more emo influenced, integrating more emotional lyrics, softer vocal delivery and octave chords. This eventually led the way for other straight edge/hardcore bands to do so, such as Split Lip and Falling Forward. Lead singer Skip Candelori and guitarist Jay Laughlin previously formed Moorestown, New Jersey-based Pointless. Ken Flavell, drums, originally played drums with brother Chris Flavell in the early southern New Jersey hardcore band, Failsafe. Nick Greif, bass, previously played bass in the late 80's straight-edge hardcore band, Awareness. Matthew Kerfoot, guitarist in Awareness, was Greif's original choice to play drums in Turning Point. Kerfoot declined, opting to leave for college. Candelori died in 2002 of an accidental drug overdose.In March 2016, it was announced that the band would perform at the This Is Hardcore festival in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in August. Tim McMahon (Mouthpiece), Geoff Rickly (Thursday, United Nations) and Rob Fish (108) performed vocals for this appearance. Members Frank "Skip" Candelori â€“
