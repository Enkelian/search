Biker metal
Biker metal (also known as biker punk) is a fusion genre that combines elements of punk rock, heavy metal, rock and roll and blues, that was pioneered in the late-1970s to early-1980s in England and the United States, by Mot√∂rhead, Plasmatics, Anti-Nowhere League and Girlschool. Characteristics Biker metal has been described as being influenced by punk rock, rock and roll, heavy metal and blues. Sleazegrinder, a writer at Classic Rock, described biker metal as "glam metal gone Mad Max".Biker metal is characterized by its mid-tempo approach to metal, its "gritty and American" sound, and its alignment with biker culture as a whole. The genre has been contrasted with slower and more operatic forms of metal, such as Judas Priest's work in the early 2000s. Similarly, biker metal eschews the speed and virtuosity that rose to prominence in the 1980s.Bands such as Black Moth, Orange Goblin, The Obsessed, Earthride and Black Label Society have been described as fusing the style with doom metal, whereas Clutch have been described as merging elements of biker metal and Southern rock into their stoner rock sound. Black Sabbath's song Paranoid has been considered a classic of the genre. Biker metal has proven influential to genres
