Back on Earth
The Ozzman Cometh is a compilation album by British heavy metal singer Ozzy Osbourne released in 1997. It is his third greatest hits collection. Its initial, limited edition 2-CD pressing contained five previously unreleased songs. Versions released in 2002 and later have only one disc, and the song "Shot in the Dark" is replaced by "Miracle Man". This was due to a legal action brought about by the song's co-writer, Phil Soussan, for unpaid royalties. The tracks "Black Sabbath", "War Pigs", "Fairies Wear Boots", and "Behind the Wall of Sleep" were performed by Osbourne's previous band Black Sabbath, during a session for the BBC Radio 1 Sunday show "The John Peel Sessions", conducted by British DJ John Peel and dated 26 April 1970. "Fairies Wear Boots" and "War Pigs" are early versions of tracks that would finally be recorded on the band's second album Paranoid and thus have different lyrics. The interview found on the second disc is from 1988, where Osbourne speaks about his latest album at the time (No Rest for the Wicked), about his new guitarist Zakk Wylde and his past days in Black Sabbath. Note on versions post-2002: The album tracks are from the 2002 remasters,
