Terrytoons
Terrytoons was an animation studio in New Rochelle, New York, that produced animated cartoons for theatrical release from 1929 to 1972. Terrytoons was founded by Paul Terry, and operated out of the "K" Building in downtown New Rochelle. The studio created many cartoon characters including Heckle and Jeckle, Mighty Mouse, Gandy Goose, Sourpuss, Dinky Duck, Little Roquefort, and Luno; Terry's preexisting character Farmer Al Falfa was also featured often. The "New Terrytoons" period of the late 1950s through mid 1960s produced such characters as Deputy Dawg, Hector Heathcote, Hashimoto, Sidney the Elephant, Possible Possum, James Hound, Astronut, Sad Cat, and The Mighty Heroes. Ralph Bakshi got his start as an animator, and eventually as a director, at Terrytoons. The Terrytoons shorts were originally released to theaters by 20th Century Fox. The Terrytoons library was later purchased by CBS, and are now owned by Paramount Pictures.
