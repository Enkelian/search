Air France Flight 5672
Air France Flight 5672 (AF5672) was a domestic passenger flight from Nantes Atlantique Airport to Brest-Guipavas Airport, France, which crashed on 22 June 2003. The flight was a Bombardier CRJ100ER operated by Brit Air, a regional airline which was a subsidiary of Air France. The aircraft crashed during its landing phase, striking multiple obstacles and then crashed onto a road and bursting into flames. The occupants were evacuated immediately. The pilot was killed in the crash, while 23 survived. The crash was dubbed a miracle flight, as almost all of the occupants survived the crash. The media called the event the "Miracle in Brest" (French: Les miraculés du Nantes-Brest)An investigation led by France's air accident investigation body, the Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la Sécurité de l'Aviation Civile (BEA), revealed that the crew of Flight 5672 neglected to select the approach mode on the autopilot. As a result, the glideslope was not captured. The aircraft subsequently deviated significantly from its expected flight path, and the issue worsened as the crew failed to monitor the aircraft's altitude. The Ground Proximity Warning System sounded the alarm, and the aircraft crashed and burst into flames. The crash was the third recorded hull loss
