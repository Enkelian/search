Psycho Man (Black Sabbath song)
"Psycho Man" is a single by heavy metal band Black Sabbath. It was originally released on the Reunion album in 1998, and was the first of two new singles from the album, the other being "Selling My Soul." The song reached number 3 on the U.S. Mainstream Rock chart. The song was later included in Ozzy Osbourne's 2005 box set Prince of Darkness. The music and lyrics were written by singer Ozzy Osbourne and guitarist Tony Iommi. Psycho Man and Selling My Soul are the only Black Sabbath songs to be credited just to these two members. In Canada, the song reached number 24 on the RPM charts. In 1999, "Psycho Man" was remixed by Danny Saber for No Boundaries: A Benefit for the Kosovar Refugees; music critic Robert Christgau regarded it as a highlight of the album.
