Old Dominion Monarchs and Lady Monarchs
The Old Dominion Monarchs and Lady Monarchs are composed of 18 teams representing Old Dominion University in intercollegiate athletics. Men's sports include baseball, basketball, football, golf, sailing, soccer, swimming and diving, and tennis. Women's sports include basketball, field hockey, lacrosse, golf, sailing, soccer, swimming and diving, tennis, rowing, and volleyball. The Monarchs compete in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) and are members of Conference USA (C-USA) as their primary conference affiliation. The football team played one season as an independent as part of the transition to FBS and began competing as a full football-playing member of C-USA in 2014. Old Dominion's field hockey team competes in the Big East Conference. The field hockey program had previously announced that it would join the original Big East for the 2013â€“14 school year. However, following the split of the original Big East, the two successor conferences, the new Big East and the American Athletic Conference, agreed that The American would not sponsor field hockey, and the new Big East would take in all of The American's programs in those sports as associate members. The women's lacrosse team spent the 2013-14 academic year as an independent before joining the Atlantic Sun
