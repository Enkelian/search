Sunday Girl
"Sunday Girl" is a 1978 song written and recorded by the American group Blondie. The track was a no. 1 hit in the UK Singles Chart for three weeks in May 1979, but despite this was not released as a single in the United States. Song information The song was written by Chris Stein and was the fourth single to be taken from the album, Parallel Lines, in the UK and most other parts of the world. The single had an unusual release in Australia, with some dispute among fans as to whether it reached no. 1 there or failed to chart. This is because of its initial release as the lead single from Parallel Lines, due to its being reminiscent of "In The Flesh", Blondie's first hit in Australia. "Sunday Girl" failed to chart, however, and was later re-released as a double A-side with "Heart of Glass", on the back of its UK success. As a result, it was eclipsed by the disco track, and is rarely recognised as having charted in its own right. Like Blondie's earlier single, "Hanging on the Telephone", the drumming pattern of "Sunday Girl" employs a double backbeat rhythm.A French-language version of the track
