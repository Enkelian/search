History Kohlhammer Verlag was founded in Stuttgart on 30 April 1866 by Wilhelm Kohlhammer. Kohlhammer had taken over the businesses of his late father-in-law, a 120-year-old printer and a profitable bathhouse. The printing business, operating out of the back of a commercial building at 14 Urbanstrasse, became W. Kohlhammer Verlag and was funded by proceeds from the bathhouse until it was closed in 1890. Urban paperbacks Kohlhammer Verlag's science program is formed by its Urban paperbacks, a well-known series in Germany whose topics include history, psychology, education, theology, and philosophy. Urban was founded in 1953, making it the first scientific paperback serial in Germany, by Fritz Ernst. Citations External links Official website
