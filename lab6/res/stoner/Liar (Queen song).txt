Liar (Queen song)
"Liar" is a song by the British rock band Queen, written by the lead singer Freddie Mercury in 1970, and originally titled "Lover". The song featured on the band's 1973 debut album Queen and it makes prominent use of the flanging effect, especially on the drums and cowbell. A heavily truncated version of "Liar" was released as a single – backed with "Doing All Right" – in the United States by Elektra Records and in Thailand by Royal Sound in February 1974. The music video consisted of the band miming to the song on a sound stage. As confirmed by the transcription on EMI Music Publishing's Off The Record sheet music for the song, this is one of three Queen tracks, the others being "Now I'm Here" and "Under Pressure" (their collaboration originally with David Bowie), to feature a Hammond organ. This song briefly brought up the issue of songwriting credits within the band. May queried which band members would be credited for developing the music for each song, to which Mercury concluded the discussion, stating that the lyricist, or otherwise the individual who originates the song, should be credited as its writer, a practice that continued until The Miracle.
