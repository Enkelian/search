Central Committee elected by the 12th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)
The Central Committee (CC) composition was elected by the 12th Congress, and sat from 25 April 1923 until 31 May 1924. The CC 1st Plenary Session renewed the composition of the Politburo, Secretariat and the Organizational Bureau (OB) of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks). Keys Plenums The CC was not a permanent institution. It convened plenary sessions, of which ten CC plenary sessions and one joint CCâ€“Central Control Commission (CCC) plenary sessions were held between the 12th Congress and the 13th Congress. When the CC was not in session, decision-making powers were transferred to inner bodies of the CC itself; the Politburo, Secretariat and Orgburo (none of these bodies were permanent either, but convened several times a months). Apparatus Individuals employed by Central Committee's bureaus, departments and newspapers made up the apparatus between the 12th Congress and the 13th Congress. The bureaus and departments were supervised by the Secretariat, and each secretary (member of the Secretariat) supervised a specific department. The leaders of departments were officially referred to as Heads, while the titles of bureau leaders varied between chairman, first secretary and secretary.
