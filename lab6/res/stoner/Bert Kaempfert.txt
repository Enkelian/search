Bert Kaempfert
Bert Kaempfert (born Berthold Heinrich Kämpfert, 16 October 1923 – 21 June 1980) was a German orchestra leader, multi-instrumentalist, music producer, arranger, and composer. He made easy listening and jazz-oriented records and wrote the music for a number of well-known songs, including "Strangers in the Night" and "Moon Over Naples". Early life and career Kaempfert was born in Hamburg, Germany, where he received his lifelong nickname, Fips, and studied at the local school of music. A multi-instrumentalist, he was hired by Hans Busch to play with his orchestra before serving as a bandsman in the German Navy during World War II. He later formed his own big band, toured with them, then worked as an arranger and producer, making hit records with Freddy Quinn and Ivo Robić. Kaempfert met his future wife, Hannelore, in 1945. They married a year later, August 14, 1946. He had two daughters, Marion and Doris. Bert Kaempfert & His Orchestra Kaempfert's own first hit with his orchestra had been "Wonderland by Night". Recorded in July 1959, the song couldn't get a hearing in Germany, so Kaempfert took the track to Decca Records in New York, who released it in America in the fall of 1960.
