Revolver (magazine)
Revolver is a metal music and hard rock magazine, publishing in North America. It has been in print for over 19 years, and is about both established acts and up-and-comers in heavy music. Revolver recently underwent a brand relaunch, including a redesigned print edition and website, intended to embody the art and culture of heavy music. The magazine was formerly owned by Harris Publications, Future US, and NewBay Media, but Project M Group LLC bought Revolver in 2017. References External links Official website
