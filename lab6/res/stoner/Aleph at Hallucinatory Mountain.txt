Aleph at Hallucinatory Mountain
Aleph at Hallucinatory Mountain is a studio album by the British experimental band Current 93, released in May 2009 on Coptic Cat Records. After collaborating with Om on a split EP, there is a notably heavy sound on this record, citing doom metal and stoner rock as influences. There was also a limited edition of the recording for subscribers who paid in advance including a second CD with a rough mix of the tracks and also a monophonic version that was released for the band's concert at German Wave Gotik Treffen 2009 with all of the tracks titled differently, though the music remains the same.
