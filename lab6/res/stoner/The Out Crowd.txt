Then I Saw The Holy City was produced by Brian Coates, engineer/producer for The Dandy Warhols, and released in the fall of 2004 on The Kora Records. The Out Crowd supported fellow neo-psychedelic bands Dead Meadow and The Warlocks nationally in 2004 as well as The Dandy Warhols on their 2005 North American tour.
