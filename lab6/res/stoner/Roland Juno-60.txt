Roland Juno-60
The Roland Juno-60 is synthesizer manufactured by Roland Corporation from 1982 to 1984. It followed the Juno 6, an almost identical synthesizer received months earlier. The synthesizers introduced Roland's digitally controlled oscillators, allowing for greatly improved tuning stability. It was widely used in 1980s pop music. Development The late 1970s and 1980s saw the introduction of the first digital synthesizers, such as the Fairlight CMI and Synclavier. Roland president Ikutaro Kakehashi recognized that the synthesizer market was moving away from analog synthesis, but Roland had no commercially viable digital technology. He approached American engineer John Chowning about his recently developed means of FM synthesis, but Yamaha had already secured exclusive rights.Roland's response was the Juno 6, released in 1982. It used mostly traditional analog technology, with a voltage-controlled filter, voltage-controlled amplifier, low-frequency oscillator, and ADSR envelope generators. However, it also used digitally controlled oscillators (DCOs), analog oscillators controlled by digital circuits. As opposed to the voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs) of previous synthesizers, which frequently went out of tune, the DCOs ensured tuning stability. According to Sound on Sound, "The Juno 6 was the first analog polysynth that you could carry onto a stage, switch on, and play with complete confidence that
