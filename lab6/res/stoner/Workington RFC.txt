Workington RFC (founded 1877), also known as Workington Zebras, is an English rugby union club that is based in the town of Workington in Cumbria. The club operates four men's teams, a ladies teams and four boy's junior teams (under 13 to under 18). The men's 1st XV currently play in Cumbria 2 - a level 9 league in the English rugby union system. They play home games at the Ellis Road Ground. History Formed in 1877 as 'Workington Football Club', the club had its first ever game in November of that year, a loss against fellow Cumbrian side, Whitehaven, who had themselves formed in 1876. Founded by cricketers looking for a summer game, the club played early fixtures at Valentine Ground, which they shared with Workington Cricket Club. They were based at the cricket club until 1883, when they moved to a former greyhound stadium, Lonsdale Park. In 1890 the club gained its nickname 'Zebras' when Boer War veterans, who were watching a game involving the side, gave the unflattering remark that that they played like 'a herd of Zebras', which was (at the time) as much a reflection on the way they played the game as their kit
