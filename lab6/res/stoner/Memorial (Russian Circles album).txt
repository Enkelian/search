Memorial (Russian Circles album)
Memorial is the fifth studio album by the American rock band Russian Circles. The album was released on October 29, 2013 through Sargent House. Memorial was produced by Brandon Curtis (Secret Machines, Interpol), who also produced the band's two previous albums, Empros (2011) and Geneva (2009).Prior to the release of Memorial, Russian Circles released online streams of "Deficit" in August 2013, "Memorial" in September 2013 and "1777" in October 2013 to promote the album. Russian Circles' first tour in support of Memorial was a late-2013 European tour with Chelsea Wolfe. Background and composition Bassist Brian Cook said that Memorial is more "polarizing" between heavy and soft parts than previous efforts, and that the "heavy parts are much more blown out and exaggerated while the pretty moments are far more restrained, delicate, and atmospheric." Cook also described the album as being darker and more somber than previous efforts. Inspired by Pink Floyd's 1977 album Animals, Memorial's album structure features the similarly composed intro/outro songs "Memoriam" and "Memorial" to make the album start and end in the same place.
