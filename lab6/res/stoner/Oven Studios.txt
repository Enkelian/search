Oven Studios
Oven Studios is the personal recording studio of American Singer-songwriter and record producer Alicia Keys. Designed by the Walters-Storyk Design Group, the studio is located 186 Glen Cove Ave., Glen Cove N.Y. on the North Shore of Nassau County, Long Island, and features a grand piano and two isolation booths. Keys says the building is reminiscent of her grandmother's house and has decorated the walls of the studios to include pictures of Nina Simone, Janis Joplin and Bob Marley. Opened in 2005, Keys co-owns the studio with her production and songwriting partner Kerry "Krucial" Brothers. According to Walters-Storyk, the design was important to the acoustics of the building: "In the live room, the design specified special acoustic wood slotted with holes that was imported from Europe. This wood, which is 50% absorptive, played an important function in evening out the overall frequency response." Later, the studio was moved from Long Island to New York City. It is now located in the Chelsea neighborhood in Manhattan. Recordings at Oven == References ==
