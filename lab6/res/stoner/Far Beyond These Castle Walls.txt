Far Beyond These Castle Walls
Far Beyond These Castle Walls is the first album by Chris de Burgh, released by A&M Records in 1974. The title refers to Bargy Castle, which is shown on the back of the album cover. Reception Mike DeGagne of AllMusic retrospectively praised the album, saying: "His gentle, beguiling vocal style is introduced, which instantly trademarks him as a genuine master of the soft ballad... What is most important about this album is the manner in which it reveals de Burgh as one of the finest mood-invoking artists ever."
