Dublin Institute of Technology
Dublin Institute of Technology (commonly referred to as DIT) (Irish: Institiúid Teicneolaíochta Bhaile Átha Cliath) was a major third-level institution in Dublin, Ireland. On 1 January 2019 DIT was dissolved and its functions were transferred to the Technological University Dublin. The institution began with the establishment of the first technical education institution in Ireland, in 1887, and progressed through various legal and governance models, culminating in autonomy under a statute of 1992. DIT was recognised particularly for degree programmes in Product Design, Mechanical Engineering, Architecture, Engineering, Science, Marketing, Hospitality, Music, Optometry, Pharmaceuticals, Construction, Digital Media and Journalism. It was ranked, in 2014, in Times Higher Education’s top 100 university-level institutions globally under 50 years old.Influential contributions to policy debates have often placed DIT at the heart of many diverse aspects of public life in Dublin. Alumni of the Dublin Institute of Technology include many of Ireland's leading writers, artists, politicians and business leaders as well as many international figures successful in arts, architecture and business. DIT's students have come from all parts of the world. Spin-out businesses from DIT employ over 1400 people.
