Truck Yeah
"Truck Yeah" is a song recorded by American country music artist Tim McGraw. Written by Chris Lucas and Preston Brust of LoCash, Chris Janson, and Danny Myrick, the song was released on July 3, 2012 as the first single from his album Two Lanes of Freedom and his first single for Big Machine Records. The release of the single overlapped McGraw's then current single "Right Back Atcha Babe," promoted by Curb Records, due to a rivalry between the two record labels. Critical reception Billy Dukes of Taste of Country gave the song four and a half stars out of five, writing that it "isn’t intended to be the smartest song on the radio, but it might be the most fun." Matt Bjorke of Roughstock gave the song four stars out of five, saying that "the swagger of the melody and McGraw's strong delivery of the lyrics" makes it a hit. Ben Foster of Country Universe gave the song a failing grade, writing that "it sounds dumb and ridiculous upon arrival [...] and then it’s all downhill from there." Music video The music video was filmed in Chattanooga, Tennessee. It was directed by Chris Hicky and premiered in September 2012. Track
