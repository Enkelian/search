And the Cradle Will Rock...
"And the Cradle Will Rock..." is a song written and performed by Van Halen. It appears on their 1980 album Women and Children First. It was one of two singles from the album; the other is the B-side "Everybody Wants Some!!". It is also the first song released by the band that featured the keyboard playing of Eddie Van Halen. Composition The song begins with what sounds like a guitar, but is, in fact, a flanger-effected Wurlitzer electric piano played through Eddie Van Halen's 1960s model 100-watt Marshall Plexi amplifier. During live performances on the 1980 tour, Michael Anthony would play the keyboards. The bridge includes a spoken line by David Lee Roth: "Have you seen Junior's grades?" For some performances on the band's 2007–2008 tour, he changed this line to "Have you seen Wolfie's grades?"—a reference to Wolfgang Van Halen, Eddie's son and the band's bassist since 2006. Eric Carr of KISS played "And the Cradle Will Rock..." along with Van Halen's cover of "You Really Got Me" as part of his audition tape, which successfully led to his becoming the new drummer for KISS. == References ==
