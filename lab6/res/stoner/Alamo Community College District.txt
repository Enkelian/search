The district was founded in 1945 as the San Antonio Union Junior College District before adopting the Alamo name in 1982. Colleges in the district The five colleges in the district operate with a high degree of autonomy, though the colleges' accrediting agency, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, placed three in a year-long warning period from January 2017 over issues of institutional autonomy.
