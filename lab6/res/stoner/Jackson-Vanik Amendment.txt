Jackson-Vanik Amendment
The Jackson–Vanik amendment to the Trade Act of 1974 is a 1974 provision in United States federal law intended to affect U.S. trade relations with countries with non-market economies (originally, countries of the Communist bloc) that restrict freedom of emigration and other human rights. The amendment, named after its major co-sponsors Henry M. "Scoop" Jackson of Washington in the Senate and Charles A.

The Trade Act of 1974 passed both houses of the United States Congress unanimously, and President Gerald Ford signed the bill into law with the adopted amendment on January 3, 1975. Over time, a number of countries were granted conditional normal trade relations subject to annual review, and a number of countries were liberated from the amendment. In December 2012, the Magnitsky Act, which repeals the application of the Jackson–Vanik amendment to the Russian Federation, was signed into law by President Obama.
