Of Cabbages and Kings (band)
Of Cabbages and Kings is an American noise rock band from Chicago, Illinois. Its name is a quote from Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass. The band's sound has been described as a "highly visceral attack" that is "founded on a vivid technical mastery owing little to the commonly revered tenets of speed and/or flash, instead conjuring a brutal, primal power and intensity virtually unmatched in modern music."

However, Kizys and Master were the core of the band, remaining the only consistent members throughout its existence. All three of their albums featured Diane Wlezien, who sang lead vocals on about half the songs with Kizys handling lead vocals on the remainder.In 1988, Ted left to focus on his work with the band Prong and was replaced by Rich Hutchins (Live Skull, Ruin..., Lubricated Goat, etc.). Basic Pain Basic Pleasure was released in 1990 and is usually considered the highpoint of the band's discography, showcasing refined production and arrangements with increased musical variety.
