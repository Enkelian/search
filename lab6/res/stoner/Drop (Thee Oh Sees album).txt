Drop (Thee Oh Sees album)
Drop is the fifteenth studio album by American psychedelic rock band Thee Oh Sees, released on April 19, 2014 on Castle Face Records. Primarily a collaboration between core member John Dwyer and regular collaborator Chris Woodhouse, the album is the ninth to be released under the name, Thee Oh Sees. The album was released following initial plans for Thee Oh Sees to take "a well deserved break," and was recorded during a "transitional period" for the band. It did not feature contributions from then-band members Brigid Dawson (vocals, keyboard), Petey Dammit (bass, guitar) and Mike Shoun (drums), and, following the album's release, Dwyer reconfigured Thee Oh Sees line-up into a three piece featuring himself, bass guitarist Tim Hellman and drummer Nick Murray for Drop's accompanying tour. Background In 2013, Thee Oh Sees released their fourteenth studio album, Floating Coffin, to widespread critical acclaim and extensive touring. In December 2013, at a concert in San Francisco, core member John Dwyer announced to the audience: "This will be the last [Thee] Oh Sees show for a long while, so dig in," fueling speculation that the band was entering an extended hiatus after several years of continuous releases and touring.
