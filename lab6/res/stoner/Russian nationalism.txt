Russian nationalism
Russian nationalism, the Russian version of nationalism, promotes the celebration, appreciation and love for Russian culture and history, as well as Russian cultural identity and unity. Russian nationalism first rose in the early 19th and became closely related to pan-Slavism, from its origin during the Russian Empire to the Soviet Union and beyond. Although often viewed in ethnic terms, this is not characteristic of Russian nationalism more generally. History Imperial Russian nationalism The Russian motto "Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality" was coined by Count Sergey Uvarov and adopted by Emperor Nicholas I as official ideology. Three components of Uvarov's triad were: Orthodoxy—Orthodox Christianity and protection of the Russian Orthodox Church. Autocracy—unconditional loyalty to the House of Romanov in return for paternalist protection for all social estates. Nationality (Narodnost, has been also translated as national spirit)—recognition of the state-founding role on Russian nationality.The Slavophile movement became popular in 19th-century Russia. Slavophiles opposed influences of Western Europe in Russia and were determined to protect Russian culture and traditions. Aleksey Khomyakov, Ivan Kireyevsky, and Konstantin Aksakov are credited with co-founding the movement. A notable folk revival in Russian art was loosely related to Slavophilia. Many works concerning Russian history, mythology and fairy tales appeared.
