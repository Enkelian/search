Wolf Eyes is an American experimental music group from Detroit, Michigan, formed in 1996 by Nate Young. Currently a duo, Wolf Eyes are a prominent act within contemporary noise music. They have collaborated with a variety of artists from different countries and art forms. History Wolf Eyes began as a solo project of Nate Young. Aaron Dilloway joined in 1998 while also playing with John Olson in Universal Indians. Olson occasionally performed with Wolf Eyes under the moniker Spykes and joined Wolf Eyes in 2000 after Universal Indians disbanded. In 2005, Dilloway left Wolf Eyes, disinterested in extensive touring.

He was replaced in the lineup by another Michigan musician, Jim Baljo. Both Aaron Dilloway and Mike Connelly appeared on the 2013 album No Answer: Lower Floors.
