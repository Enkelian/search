Ruthenium(III) chloride
Ruthenium(III) chloride is the chemical compound with the formula RuCl3. "Ruthenium(III) chloride" more commonly refers to the hydrate RuCl3·xH2O. Both the anhydrous and hydrated species are dark brown or black solids. The hydrate, with a varying proportion of water of crystallization, often approximating to a trihydrate, is a commonly used starting material in ruthenium chemistry. The compound is also widely regarded as a prime candidate to realize Kitaev quantum spin liquid state with Majorana Fermion excitations. Preparation and properties Anhydrous ruthenium(III) chloride is usually prepared by heating powdered ruthenium metal with chlorine. In the original synthesis, the chlorination was conducted in the presence of carbon monoxide, the product being carried by the gas stream and crystallising upon cooling. Two allotropes of RuCl3 are known. The black α-form adopts the CrCl3-type structure with long Ru-Ru contacts of 346 pm. This allotrope has honeycomb layers of Ru3+ which are surrounded with an octahedral cage of Cl− anions. The Ruthenium cations are magnetic residing in a low-spin J~1/2 ground state with net angular momentum L=1. Layers of α-RuCl3 are stacked on top of each other with weak Van-der-Waals forces. These can be cleaved to form mono-layers using scotch tape. α-RuCl3 came to limelight
