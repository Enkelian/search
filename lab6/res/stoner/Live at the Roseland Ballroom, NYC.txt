Paul Shaffer makes a guest appearance on the songs "Shakin' All Over", "Roll On Down The Highway" and "Takin' Care of Business". Background Asked in Goldmine about the making of the album, Bachman explained: "When we got asked to do a 3-D shoot for PBS, and then we could use the rights for our own DVD and Blu-ray, we thought this was a golden opportunity. So there was a place in Chicago that was chosen and/or the Roseland in New York. And because we were not one of their big shoots, we were put on hold, so we had to wait until these other acts either agreed to play Chicago or New York, and then the truck with all of the equipment [would be there] shooting 3-D material for PBS. As it happened, there were two days off at Roseland in New York, so we took them."
