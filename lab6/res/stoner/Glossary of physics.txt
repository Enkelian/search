Glossary of physics
This glossary of physics is a list of definitions of terms and concepts relevant to physics, its sub-disciplines, and related fields, including mechanics, materials science, nuclear physics, particle physics, and thermodynamics. For more inclusive glossaries concerning related fields of science and technology, see Glossary of chemistry terms, Glossary of astronomy, Glossary of areas of mathematics, and Glossary of engineering. A ab initio A mathematical model which seeks to describe atomic nuclei by solving the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation for all constituent nucleons and the forces that exist between them. Such methods yield precise results for very light nuclei but become more approximate for heavier nuclei. Abbe number Also called the V-number or constringence. In optics and lens design, a measure of a transparent material's dispersion (a variation of refractive index versus wavelength). High values of V indicate low dispersion. absolute electrode potential In electrochemistry, the electrode potential of a metal measured with respect to a universal reference system (without any additional metal–solution interface). absolute humidity The ratio of the water vapor in a sample of air to the volume of the sample. absolute magnitude Is a measure of the luminosity of a celestial object, on a logarithmic astronomical magnitude scale.
