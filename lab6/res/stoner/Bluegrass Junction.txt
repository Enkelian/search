Bluegrass Junction
Bluegrass Junction is a bluegrass music channel on Sirius XM Radio. It is billed as "America's Bluegrass Home", and primarily airs complete versions of music from many bluegrass artists. Some of those are Bill Monroe, Seldom Scene, Flatt & Scruggs, and Sam Bush, in addition to more modern acoustic groups playing rock and roll music on what are considered to be traditional bluegrass instruments. It is heard on Sirius XM Radio 62 and Dish Network 6062. Bluegrass Junction was one of the original XM channels at launch in 2001. Sirius picked up the channel in November 2008 (replacing its own Bluegrass channel) after the two services merged. During the 2015 Holiday Season (Sunday 12/06/15 at 12 pm ET until Tuesday 12/15/15 at 3 am ET), Bluegrass Junction was replaced by Radio Hanukkah.
