Windermere, Cumbria (town)
Windermere () is a town and civil parish in the South Lakeland District of Cumbria, England. It has a population of 8,245 increasing to 8,359 at the 2011 Census, and lies about half a mile (1 km) east of the lake, Windermere. Although the town Windermere does not touch the lake (it took the name of the lake when the railway line was built in 1847 and the station was called "Windermere"), it has now grown together with the older lakeside town of Bowness-on-Windermere, though the two retain distinguishable town centres. Tourism is popular in the town owing to its proximity to the lake and local scenery. Boats from the piers in Bowness sail around the lake, many calling at Ambleside or at Lakeside where there is a restored railway. Windermere Hotel opened at the same time as the railway. The civil parish contains both towns, the village of Troutbeck Bridge to the north and several hamlets, including Storrs to the south and Heaning to the east. Belle Isle and part of the lake are also within its boundaries. History Historically a part of Westmorland, Windermere town was known as Birthwaite prior to the arrival of the Kendal and Windermere
