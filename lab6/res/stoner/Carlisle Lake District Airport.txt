The airport is located on a hillside above the River Irthing. The airport has been the location for some prehistoric excavations.Since May 2009, the airport has been owned by the Stobart Group on a 150-year lease, expiring 2151. Between December 2014 and September 2015, a Â£12 million freight distribution centre was built on the south-eastern corner of the site, which is now leased to Eddie Stobart Logistics. Stobart Group also intended to build a further warehousing and distribution hub from 2017 on land adjacent to the freight distribution centre.
