Strange Frontier
Strange Frontier is the second album by the English musician Roger Taylor. This album includes two covers as well as a heavier sound than the previous album. Although Taylor again played most of the instruments himself (drums, guitars, bass and keyboards) and did most of the vocals, there were some occasional cameos by producer David Richards (on synths and piano), Status Quo member Rick Parfitt (on rhythm guitar) and Queen's bass guitarist John Deacon (on bass and mixing), Brian May (rhythm guitar on "Man on Fire") and Freddie Mercury (additional keyboards, and it is rumoured Mercury did backing vocals on "Killing Time", although this is speculative). The US edition has the track order rearranged. Multiple musical elements from the song "I Cry for You (Love, Hope and Confusion)" (the drum machine, harmonies, chord progressions and overall arrangement) had already been used for the Queen hit song "Radio Ga Ga", released earlier the same year.
