SIU Edwardsville Cougars wrestling
The SIU Edwardsville Cougars wrestling team represents Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE) as an Associate Member of the Mid-American Conference of NCAA Division I wrestling (SIUE's primary conference, the Ohio Valley Conference, does not sponsor wrestling). The Cougars host their home matches at the Sam M. Vadalabene Center on the university's campus in Edwardsville, Illinois, United States. The Cougars current head coach is Jeremy Spates who took over the program in 2013.

Practices were held in hallways of the Peck Classroom Building (now known as Peck Hall) and the University Center (now known as the Morris University Center). Home meets were held in the Meridian Ballroom in the University Center. Despite these drawbacks, by the time the SIU Board of Trustees authorized the awarding of athletic scholarships in 1973, Kristoff's teams had built a dual meet record of 25–7–2, and two wrestlers had won All-American status.
