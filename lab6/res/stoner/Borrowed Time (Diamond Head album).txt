Borrowed Time (Diamond Head album)
Borrowed Time is the second studio album by Diamond Head. The album was recorded in 1981 and released in 1982, reaching Number 24 on the UK album chart. In a 2008 interview, guitarist Brian Tatler announced that this was his favourite period with Diamond Head and that the band "seemed to be getting somewhere after six years of building". Album information This was the band's first major label released after being signed to MCA Records in 1981. As this was their first album under a major label, the album was much cleaner and better produced. However, some now say that MCA were the wrong label for Diamond Head, which is one of the contributions to their downfall. Some have also questioned the necessity for "Am I Evil?" and "Lightning to the Nations" to be included on the album, since they had already appeared on the band's debut album, Lightning to the Nations. Although the reason for this was that their first album was only meant as a demo with the idea of Borrowed Time being their first official album. However, things have not quite worked out that way with the former becoming their most notable work to date. Style This
