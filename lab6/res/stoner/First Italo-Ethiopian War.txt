First Italo-Ethiopian War
The First Italo-Ethiopian War was fought between Italy and Ethiopia (supported by Russia and France) from 1895 to 1896. It originated from the disputed Treaty of Wuchale which, the Italians claimed, turned the country into an Italian protectorate. During the war, the Ethiopians were vastly numerically superior, well-armed with modern firearms and aided by Russia and France with volunteers, military advisers, army training, and the sale of weapons. In contrast, Italy was a young and mostly poor nation, and equipped with antiquated weapons.Full-scale war broke out in 1895, with Italian troops from Italian Eritrea having initial success until Ethiopian troops counterattacked Italian positions and besieged the Italian fort of Mekele, forcing its surrender. Italian defeat came about after the Battle of Adwa, where the Ethiopian army dealt the heavily outnumbered Italians and Eritrean askaris a decisive blow and forced their retreat back into Eritrea. Some Eritreans, regarded as traitors by the Ethiopians, were also captured and mutilated. The war concluded with the Treaty of Addis Ababa. Though it was not the first African victory over Western colonists, this war became a pre-eminent symbol of the pan-Africanism and secured the Ethiopia's sovereignty until 1936.
