Music Publishers' Association
The Music Publishers Association of the United States (MPA) is a non-profit music publishing organization based in New York City. Founded in 1895, the MPA is the oldest music trade organization in the United States which addresses itself to issues pertaining to print publishing with an emphasis on copyright education and advocacy. Tab and lyric sites The MPA considers websites that offer lyrics and guitar tabs for free, without any licensing from the artist or record label, as copyright infringement. Former MPA president Lauren Keiser has stated that he wanted jail time in addition to fines and the removal of offending websites.In March 2006, the MPA issued a statement in which they explained their position on websites that distribute unauthorized sheet music and tablature.Several points are made in the statement: MPA members invest a significant amount into arranging, engraving, editing, marketing, and distributing sheet music products, and illegal tablature cuts into their sales. Sharing the tabs is bad enough, but even worse is when sites make money off the illegal tabs. Guitar tabs do not circumvent copyright laws just because they're claimed to be personal interpretations. Viewing illegal tabs is equivalent to stealing sheet music from a local music store.
