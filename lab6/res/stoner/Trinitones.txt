Trinitones
Trinitones is an all-male a cappella ensemble from Trinity College Dublin, the only constituent college of the University of Dublin in Ireland. Founded in 2012, the group are generally considered the pioneers of the collegiate a cappella genre in Ireland, which was hitherto seen as an American cultural phenomenon. In February 2013, the group released a cover of Wheatus' "Teenage Dirtbag", which achieved overnight viral success on YouTube and led to acclaim from Wheatus themselves as well as performances on The Morning Show on national broadcaster TV3. Since this inaugural release, the group have gone on to produce further recordings and music videos of a cappella covers which feature as highlights of their diverse popular repertoire.In terms of structure, the group resembles a small male-voice chamber choir of approximately 14 members, featuring bass, baritone, tenor and countertenor parts in addition to a vocal percussionist. Membership is open to current students of Trinity College with auditions held in Fresher's Week of the Michaelmas term. The group have toured Ireland, the UK, Hungary, Canada, the United States, and Australia, and continue to perform in Ireland with great regularity throughout the year. They are regulars at Ireland's main music festival, Electric Picnic, and
