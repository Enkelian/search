Nasty Suicide
Nasty Suicide (born Jan-Markus Stenfors on 27 February 1963) is a Finnish musician. He is most famous for being one of the founding members of Hanoi Rocks, the group's rhythm guitarist between 1979 and 1985. Hanoi Rocks was a Finnish rock band that combined elements of punk, glam rock, rock and roll, and blues. Before his tenure in Hanoi Rocks, Suicide played guitar in a Finnish punk band called Briard in the late 1970s. Suicide replaced Andy McCoy in Briard after McCoy joined Pelle Miljoona Oy. After the breakup of Hanoi Rocks in 1985, he and his former bandmate Andy McCoy recorded an acoustic album under the name The Suicide Twins which was released in 1986 and was titled Silver Missiles and Nightingales. At the same time McCoy and Suicide started The Cherry Bombz, which included Timo Caltio on bass (later replaced by Dave Tregunna), Terry Chimes on drums and singer Anita Chellemah. The Cherry Bombz released two EPs: The Cherry Bombz (1985) and House Of Ecstasy (1986) as well as a live album, Coming Down Slow (1986). After The Cherry Bombz Nasty went on to form his own band Cheap and Nasty, which was active from 1990 to 1994.
