Bad Hat Harry Productions
Bad Hat Harry Productions is an American film and television production company founded in 1994 by director Bryan Singer. It has produced such films as The Usual Suspects and the X-Men film series, as well as the television series House. The name is a homage to Steven Spielberg and comes from a line uttered by Roy Scheider in the 1975 feature Jaws. Martin Brody says to an elderly swimmer who teases him about not going in the water, "That's some bad hat, Harry." The original 2004 logo paid homage to this scene. The current logo, introduced in 2011, is taken from the police lineup scene of The Usual Suspects. The future of the production company is currently uncertain due to the sexual abuse allegations made against Singer in 2017.
