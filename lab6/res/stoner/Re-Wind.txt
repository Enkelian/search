Re-Wind
Re-Wind is a remix double album by Vancouver industrial band Front Line Assembly, released in 1998. All tracks were originally recorded for the band's previous studio album "FLAvour of the weak" (some as b-sides). The band's longtime mixer, Greg Reely, had been absent on "FLAvour" and was brought back in on Re-Wind; therefore, disc one sees the band remixing itself with Reelys help. Disc two presents remixes by other artists. Release The track "Predator (Final Mix by Collide)" is featured on the soundtrack album from 2005 thriller The Covenant. According to Collide, the original name of the remix is "Radioactive Mix". On account of an oversight at the label the name "Final Mix" appeared on the CD.In 2016, Canadian label Artoffact reissued the album on vinyl.
