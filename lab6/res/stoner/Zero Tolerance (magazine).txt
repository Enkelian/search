Zero Tolerance (magazine)
Zero Tolerance Magazine is an extreme music magazine published by Obdurate Ltd. in the United Kingdom. Published bi-monthly, it can be found on newsstands in the UK, Europe and North America - and is available (with some delay) on newsstands in Australia and specialist retailers in New Zealand and Taiwan. The magazine features a covermount CD. It was launched in 2004 by Lisa Macey (formerly publisher of Terrorizer Magazine) and Leon Macey (of experimental UK extreme metal band Mithras). The magazine is edited by Nathan T.Birk. Previous editors are Calum Harvie and Lee du-Caine. Zero Tolerance Magazine gives coverage to both established extreme music artists and underground artists without the balance of coverage tipping in favour of the most obvious artists. ZT is especially notable for seeking out obscure artists in experimental noise music and power electronics - a 4-page section entitled Power Lines is curated by the magazine's resident noise "expert" Scott McKeating and features every issue. With Nathan T. Birk curating the Underground Black Metal (UGBM) section and the recent introduction of the Cormac O'Síocháin curated Anger Burning section - dedicated to crust, d-beat, rawpunk, hardcore-punk and dis-core - the magazine covers metal as well as similar genres.
