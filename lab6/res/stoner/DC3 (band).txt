DC3 (band)
DC3 (also known as D.C. 3) was an American rock and roll band formed by singer, songwriter and guitarist Dez Cadena in 1983 and active until 1988. Cadena had been a member of California-based punk rock group Black Flag from about 1980 to 1983, first as singer, then as rhythm guitarist. 1982 was the beginning of a record distribution problem that severely curtailed Black Flag's activities. During this hiatus, Cadena formed DC3 with keyboardist Paul Roessler (formerly of LA's infamous Screamers), and drummer Jeff Dahl. Paul's younger sister, Kira, also practiced with the band early on before joining Black Flag.Their debut album, This Is The Dream, was released in 1985 on SST Records and featured a major Black Sabbath influence with very little of the hardcore or punk stylings of Black Flag. The album is particularly notable for the songs "I Believe It" and "Ain't No Time Here Now", which were originally written and played live by Black Flag and are also present on that band's The Complete 1982 Demos Plus More as "Yes I Know" (identical lyrics to the DC3 version) and "What Can You Believe" (different lyrics than the DC3 version, but nearly identical music).
