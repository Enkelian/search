Barry (album)
Barry is the seventh studio album released by singer and songwriter Barry Manilow in 1980. The album reached Platinum status. The tracks were recorded at Evergreen Recording Studios in Burbank, California. Manilow co-wrote with Maurice White of Earth, Wind & Fire the album track "Only in Chicago". "We Still Have Time" was taken from the film Tribute. The album scored one top ten pop hit, "I Made It Through the Rain", which reached number ten, in early 1981. This album was released at a time when Manilow's success was having its greatest impact overseas, particularly in the UK. His music was starting to be pushed almost entirely to easy listening or adult contemporary music radio formats. Although "I Made It Through the Rain" was his only Top-10 on the Hot 100 from this album, he managed to reach the Top-10 on the Adult-Contemporary lists with "Lonely Together" and the bouncy up-tempo "Bermuda Triangle" was a Top-20 hit in the UK in mid-1981. The album has yet to be released on CD in the US, but has had a CD release in Japan. It is however available as a digital download. Track listing Side 1 "Lonely Together" (Kenny Nolan) - 4:19
