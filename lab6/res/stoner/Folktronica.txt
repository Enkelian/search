Folktronica
Folktronica is a genre of music comprising various elements of folk music and electronica, often featuring uses of acoustic instruments – especially stringed instruments – and incorporating hip hop, electronic or dance rhythms, although it varies based on influences and choice of sounds. The Ashgate Research Companion to Popular Musicology describes folktronica as "a catch-all [term] for all manner of artists who have combined mechanical dance beats with elements of acoustic rock or folk." History Folktronica or Electrofolk first came about with the introduction of mechanical electronic drums in the 1980s. Early examples of the genre are Joni Mitchell's 1985 album 'Dog Eat Dog' and Shona Laing's 1987 album, 'South'. == References ==
