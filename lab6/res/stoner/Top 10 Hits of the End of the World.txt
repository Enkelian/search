Top 10 Hits of the End of the World
Top 10 Hits of the End of the World is a studio album by psychedelic dance duo Prince Rama consisting of sisters Taraka and Nimai Larson. Produced by Scott Colburn, it is a "retrospective requiem of all pop albums ever made" where Prince Rama revives the spirits of ten fictional musical acts who died during the apocalypse to perform hits: Arabian group Guns of Dubai, English dance act I.M.M.O.R.T.A.L.I.F.E., mafia musical group Nu Fighters, protest band Rage Peace, architect group Taohaus, bollywood film soundtrack duo Goloka, Black Elk Speaks, virtual group Hyparxia, "dancerise" duo The Metaphysixxx, and commercially successful group Motel Memory. The apocalypse concept of Top 10 Hits of the End of the World was inspired by the works of Chris Marker, Paul Laffoley, and Jean Baudrillard and continues Prince Rama's idea of the "now age" present in their previous records, where a period or moment becomes lost once it is named a "now age." A major theme of the album is based on musical acts in real life that "possess" the spirits of musical groups and artists that came before, such as Lady Gaga channeling Madonna and Creed channeling Pearl Jam.
