Grifters (band)
Grifters was a 1990s indie rock band based in Memphis who released albums on Doink, Sonic Noise, Shangri-La Records, and Sub Pop Records. "Dave got the band going about eight and half years ago. He found Scott through a lot of tapes and just decided he wanted to work with this weirdo, basically..." The band originally formed in the late 1980s as A Band Called Bud, with vocalist/guitarist Scott Taylor, bassist Tripp Lamkins, and drummer Dave Shouse who founded the band and was considered to be its leader. After being renamed Grifters (after the novel by Jim Thompson) by 1990, Shouse joined Taylor on guitar, with Stanley Gallimore taking over on the drums. Songwriting duties were shared between Shouse, Taylor and Lamkins. For several years in the 1990s they recorded primarily at Easley McCain Recording and were closely affiliated with Memphis's Shangri-La Records label. Jeff Buckley was a vocal supporter of The Grifters and was close friends with the band. The band released its last record, Full Blown Possession, before disbanding to pursue other projects.
