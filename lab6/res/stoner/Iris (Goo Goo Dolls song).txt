Originally written for the soundtrack of the 1998 film City of Angels, the song was later included on the band's sixth album Dizzy Up the Girl.

Besides becoming one of the biggest alternative rock staples of its time, "Iris" also remains one of the biggest crossover hits in the history of popular music, crossing over from modern rock radio to pop and adult contemporary radio, reaching number one on all of these formats and becoming the most played song of 1998 for all formats. The song reached number one in Australia, Canada and Italy, number three in the United Kingdom, number nine on the US Billboard Hot 100, and has become one of Ireland's best-selling singles of all time.
