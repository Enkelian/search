Last Horizon
"Last Horizon" is a guitar solo written by Queen's guitarist Brian May. Overview The record was released on December 6, 1993 as a single from its parent album, Back to the Light, and remained on the UK charts for two weeks, peaking at number 51. May plays the composition at every one of his concerts since then (including the Queen + Paul Rodgers and Queen + Adam Lambert tours). It is a slow, poignant solo, with a sad tone.
