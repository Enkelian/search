Terria (Devin Townsend album)
Terria is the fifth solo album by Canadian musician Devin Townsend. The album was released in August 2001 on Townsend's label, HevyDevy Records. Background Feeling he had "attracted a bunch of poo" with his previous album Physicist (2000), Townsend felt he had the chance to make a more personal and honest record. Townsend was inspired one morning while driving across Canada with his band, and looked to write an "introspective" album dedicated to his homeland. He produced and recorded Terria, a "highly illustrated stream-of-consciousness" album, with Gene Hoglan on drums, Craig McFarland on bass and Jamie Meyer on keyboards. The artwork of the album was handled by Travis Smith, who once called it his favorite work along with Katatonia's Last Fair Deal Gone Down. The song "Tiny Tears" derived its title from a Godflesh song with the same name off of their 1989 debut studio album Streetcleaner.

Terria features musical themes explored in Townsend's previous albums, such as Ocean Machine: Biomech. However, it is more restrained, "using silence as part of the music". Townsend cited Ween's White Pepper as an inspiration
