Kiss It Better (Deborah Harry song)
"Kiss It Better" is a single from Deborah Harry's third solo album, Def, Dumb & Blonde in 1989. The single peaked at number 12 on the US Modern Rock chart, riding the wave of success built by Harry's previous single, "I Want That Man". Though never released commercially, a promo found its way to many college radio stations, hence the song charting so much lower than the previous one. The single was also not released in the UK. "Sweet and Low"/"Kiss It Better" was released as a double A-side single in Australia in 1990. == Chart positions ==
