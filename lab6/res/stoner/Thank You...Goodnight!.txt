Thank You...Goodnight!
Thank You...Goodnight! is a live album released by the American hard rock band Great White in 2002. The album has the subtitle 'The Farewell Concert', because it contains the final performance of the band before disbandment, as announced by singer Jack Russell in November 2001. The concert was held at The Galaxy Theatre in Santa Ana, California, on 31 December 2001 and for the occasion original guitarist Mark Kendall and Sean McNabb rejoined the band. Russell and Kendall were anyway on the road again under the name 'Jack Russell's Great White' already in 2002. Two new songs, "Back to the Rhythm" and "Play On", are recorded on this album for the first time and reappeared in 2007 on the album Back to the Rhythm. The album was reissued in 2006 by Californian label Sidewinder Music under the name Once Bitten, Twice Live.
