Eyehategod
Eyehategod (also abbreviated and referred to as EHG) is an American sludge metal band from New Orleans who formed in 1988. They have become one of the better known bands to emerge from the NOLA metal scene. Throughout the years, their core line-up has remained, with the exceptions of the bassist, a slot in which several musicians have played, and the death of drummer Joey LaCaze in 2013. Eyehategod have noted Melvins, Carnivore, The Obsessed, Discharge, Black Flag, Corrosion of Conformity, Black Sabbath, Celtic Frost, Confessor and Saint Vitus as key influences to their sound. Heavy, detuned, and bluesy guitar riffs dominate the band's discography. They are combined with walls of feedback, and tortured vocals, with lyrical themes centered around substance abuse, to create a harsh misanthropic vibe. The band was friends with the grindcore group Anal Cunt and performed with them for the first show after their frontman Seth Putnam was revived from his 2004 coma. Putnam has also provided vocals for at least one EHG show in its entirety. History Early years and In the Name of Suffering (1989-92) Jimmy Bower and Joey LaCaze founded the band on April 20, 1988 (in accordance with 4/20 in cannabis culture),
