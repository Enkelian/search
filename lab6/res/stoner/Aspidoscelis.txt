Aspidoscelis is a genus of whiptail lizards in the family Teiidae. Taxonomy The nomenclature for the genus Aspidoscelis was published by T.W. Reeder et al. in 2002. Many species that were formerly included in the genus Cnemidophorus are now considered Aspidoscelis based upon divergent characters between the two groups.
