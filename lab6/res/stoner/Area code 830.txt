Area code 830
Area code 830 is the telephone area code in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) for the portion of the U.S. state of Texas surrounding and to the west of the city of San Antonio. It was created July 7, 1997, in a split from numbering plan area 210, which was reduced to most of San Antonio, with a few outer portions of the city moving to 830. This split occurred only five years after 210 split from 512. However, San Antonio's rapid growth and the proliferation of cell phones and pagers forced the entire suburban ring around San Antonio into another area code within a short time. The numbering plan area 830 completely surrounds 210/726. Geographically, the area code covers the north-western portions of South Texas, including parts of the Texas Hill Country. Counties served by this area code: Atascosa, Bandera, Bastrop, Bexar, Blanco, Burnet, Caldwell, Comal, De Witt, Dimmit, Edwards, Frio, Gillespie, Guadalupe, Karnes, Kendall, Kerr, La Salle, Live Oak, Llano, Maverick, Medina, Real, Uvalde, Val Verde, Wilson, and ZavalaTowns and cities served by this area code: Artesia Wells, Asherton, Bandera, Barksdale, Batesville, Belmont, Bergheim, Big Wells, Bigfoot, Blanco, Boerne, Brackettville, Bulverde, Camp Wood, Campbellton, Canyon Lake, Carrizo
