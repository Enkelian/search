The 1982 San Diego Chargers season was the team's 23rd year, and 13th in the National Football League. The team had a 10â€“6 record in 1981. It was a strike-shortened season so the league was divided up into two conferences instead of its normal divisional alignment. It ended with a second round loss to the Dolphins. This would be the team's last playoff appearance until 1992. The 1982 Chargers were the top-scoring team in the NFL. They scored a total of 288 points, 32 per game. They led the league in passing touchdowns (19), rushing touchdowns (15, tied with the Raiders) passing yards (2,927), and yards per attempt (8.9). The Chargers defense, however, surrendered the most passing yards (2,292), and second-most first downs (119) in the league.Chargers quarterback Dan Fouts was named the Pro Football Writers of America MVP, and 1982 AP Offensive Player of the Year. Wide receiver Wes Chandler, tight end Kellen Winslow, and guard Doug Wilkerson all made first-team All-Pro. 1982 NFL Draft Roster Schedule Week 1 Playoffs Standings References External links 1982 San Diego Chargers at pro-football-reference.com
