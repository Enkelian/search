This group were early signees to the Sonic Unyon label. History The band formed in 1994, calling themselves "Sian", which is a Hindi word meaning "intelligent" or "bright," and it is a common surname in places where Hindi is spoken. They signed with the then-fledgling record label Sonic Unyon. The original members were singer and guitarist Sean Ramsay, bassist Jay Patterson, Ryan Ferguson on guitar and synthesizer, and drummer Matthew Durrant. The following year, Somnium, their debut album, was released. The band has been compared to Slowdive, The Verve, and Boards of Canada. SIANspheric gigged frequently, mostly in Canada, through most of the late 1990s and early 2000, including a tour with Canadian shoegazers Southpacific in 2000. The band has also worked with Toshack Highway on a split album titled Magnetic Morning/Aspirin Age. A CD with ten tracks, Toshack Highway contributed the first five tracks, and SIANspheric did the remaining five. In 2000, the band broke up. Sianspheric reformed in Toronto in 2005, and put out a new 7" single, "I Wouldn't Expect You to Understand". They followed this up
