Neotibicen dealbatus
Neotibicen dealbatus, commonly called Plains cicada, is a species of annual cicada in the genus Neotibicen. Dealbatus is Latin for 'whitewashed'. This species used to be called Tibicen dealbatus, but in July 2015, after genetic and physiological evaluation and reconfiguration of the genus Tibicen, this cicada and others in the genus Tibicen were moved to newly created genera. Furthermore, the genus Tibicen still exists, but today it only encompasses a small number of European taxa. Description and identification N. dealbatus adults have beige colored eyes and like many other cicadas in the genus have a distinctive black "mask" that extends from each of the cicada's bulging eyes. This species' pronotum is light orange or olive green. Mesonotal coloring is orange, green, black or brown with three white pruinosity areas on the dorsum separated by stripes.This species may be confused for a supercifally similar, but distantly related Neotibicen species: Neotibicen dorsatus. Certain overlapping diagnostic traits are found in both cicadas; such as the pruinose patterning on the abdomen and narrow head. This can complicate accurate identification or lead to erroneous reports, but the call of males and other morphological differences, coupled with geographic locations of both species are other factors that
