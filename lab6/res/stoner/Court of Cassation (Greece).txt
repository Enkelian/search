Court of Cassation (Greece)
The Supreme Civil and Criminal Court of Greece (Greek: Άρειος Πάγος, Areopagus, i.e. the "Stone, or Hill, of Ares") is the supreme court of Greece for civil and criminal law. In Greece, the decisions of the supreme court are final. However, since Greece is a member state of the Council of Europe, cases ruled on by the Greek high court can be appealed to the European Court of Human Rights. If the supreme court decides that a lower court violated the law or principles of legal process, it can order the rehearing of a case by the lower court. The court consists of the president and the attorney-general, ten vice-presidents, sixty five areopagites and seventeen deputy attorneys-general. The members of the Supreme Court are tenured until they reach the mandatory retirement age of 67, as mandated by the Greek constitution.
