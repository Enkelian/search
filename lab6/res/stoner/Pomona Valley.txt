Pomona Valley
The Pomona Valley is located in the Greater Los Angeles Area between the San Gabriel Valley and San Bernardino Valley in Southern California. The valley is approximately 30 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, which can often be seen from nearby foothills. It ranges from the city of San Dimas from the far west to Rancho Cucamonga to the Far East portion of the valley. The alluvial valley is formed by the Santa Ana River and its tributaries. The San Antonio Creek runs right through the center of the valley dividing the valley into west and east, and also acts as a section of the border between Los Angeles County and San Bernardino County. It originates from the San Gabriel Mountains watershed around Mount San Antonio (known locally as Mt. Baldy) and joins the Santa Ana River south of Chino. The Pomona Valley is separated from San Gabriel Valley to the west by the northeastern end of the San Jose Hills, running approximately along State Route 57. The eastern boundaries are the Jurupa Hills and the Cajon Pass, (the eastern end of the San Gabriel Mountains) running near Interstate 15, which separates the Pomona Valley from the San Bernardino Valley.
