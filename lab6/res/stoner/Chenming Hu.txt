Chenming Hu
Chenming Calvin Hu (Chinese: 胡正明; pinyin: Hú Zhèngmíng; born 1947) is a Chinese/Taiwanese electronic engineer who specializes in microelectronics. He is TSMC Distinguished Professor Emeritus in the electronic engineering and computer science department of the University of California, Berkeley, in the United States. In 2009, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers described him as a “microelectronics visionary … whose seminal work on metal-oxide semiconductor MOS reliability and device modeling has had enormous impact on the continued scaling of electronic devices”. Education and career Hu completed his bachelor's degree at the National Taiwan University in Taipei in 1968, and completed master's and doctoral degrees at the University of California, Berkeley in 1970 and 1973, respectively.He is a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the University of California, Berkeley since 1976 (currently as a Professor Emeritus).He has made significant contributions in microelectronics research. He was one of the developers of the FinFET, a multi-gated MOSFET device, and was among the creators of the Berkeley Short‐Channel IGFET Model family of MOSFETs. Since the 1980s, Hu has written extensively on the reliability of the silicon oxide layer in semi-conductors.Between 2001 and 2004 Hu was the chief technology officer of Taiwan Semiconductor
