History The company was established in 1926 in Carlow as a private enterprise known as the Irish Sugar Manufacturing Company, Limited. The Sugar Manufacture Act, 1933 was passed to promote self-sufficiency in sugar manufacture; this Act was brought on by a crisis in the industry and resulted in the nationalisation of sugar manufacture. Factories were built in Mallow, Thurles and Tuam, and the company became Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann, Teoranta, the Irish for Irish Sugar Company, Limited. The Thurles and Tuam factories were closed in the early 1980s after a rationalisation became necessary, and the company decided to concentrate manufacture at its Carlow and Mallow factories.The Sugar Act, 1991 privatised the entity and it became Greencore at that time. The Act was passed as the company had diversified beyond being a sugar-manufacturing company
