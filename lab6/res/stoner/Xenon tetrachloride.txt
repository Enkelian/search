Xenon tetrachloride
Xenon tetrachloride is an unstable inorganic compound with a chemical formula XeCl4. Unlike other noble-gas/halide compounds, it cannot be synthesized by simply combining the elements, by using a more-active halogenating agent or by substitution of other halides on tetrahaloxenon compounds. Instead, a decay technique can be used, starting with K129ICl4. The iodine-129 atom of the 129ICl4â€“ covalent cluster is radioactive and undergoes beta decay to become xenon. The resulting XeCl4 molecule has a square planar molecular geometry analogous to xenon tetrafluoride.Alternately, the product can be obtained by subjecting the elements to an electric discharge. == References ==
