David Paton
David Paton (born 29 October 1949, Edinburgh, Scotland) is a Scottish bassist, guitarist and singer. He first achieved success in the mid-1970s as lead vocalist and bassist of Pilot, who scored hits with "Magic", "January", "Just a Smile" and "Call Me Round" before splitting in 1977. Paton is also known for his work in the original lineup of The Alan Parsons Project (1975-1985), and for working with acts such as Kate Bush, Camel and Elton John. Biography Paton grew up in the south-eastern suburb of Gilmerton, Edinburgh, where he attended Liberton High School. His first band was called The Beachcombers and they signed a recording contract in 1968 with CBS Records. They changed their name for The Boots and published their first single, "The Animal In Me". This was soon followed by "Keep Your Lovelight Burning", but after about two years, the band split because of money problems in 1970. He then replaced a guitarist in the Bay City Rollers, for a short period of time but never recorded with them. After leaving them in October 1970, he became a member of another band called Fresh, which changed their name for Chrystian and published a single, "Nursery Lane", in 1971.
