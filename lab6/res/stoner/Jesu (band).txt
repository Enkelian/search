Jesu (band)
Jesu (pronounced "yay-soo") are a British experimental band formed in 2003 by Justin Broadrick following the 2002 breakup of his band Godflesh. It is named after the last song on Hymns, the final album of Godflesh's initial run. Jesu's sound is heavily layered and textured, incorporating a diverse mix of influences. Broadrick himself has stated that "...it's very loosely speaking pop/rock/metal/electronica ... I'm intentionally writing what I consider to be coherent "pop" songs". Biography 2004â€“2008 Jesu's first release, the Heart Ache EP, was released in 2004 and featured Broadrick performing all of the instruments and vocals alone. It was followed four months later by the full-length Jesu LP, which featured the addition of bassist Diarmuid Dalton and drummer Ted Parsons, although not every song features both members. A tour of Europe, in support of the album, featured Roderic Mounir of Knut filling in for Ted Parsons on drums. Commenting on the sonic influences of the band, Broadrick said: "I really wanted to take that rhythm and weld it to the Godflesh sensibilities of abstract, surreal, mutated metal."With their third release, 2006's four song Silver EP, Jesu took a more melodic and layered approach, gaining comparison to shoegazing band My Bloody
