Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute
The Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute (HWNI) at the University of California, Berkeley was created in 1997, through a bequest from eight-time Wimbledon champion Helen Wills Moody, an alumna of the University of California - Berkeley. History The Berkeley Neuroscience Center (BNC) was created in 1997 under the leadership of Professors Carla Shatz and Corey Goodman, who served as the first two Directors from 1997-2001. Neuroscience professors in departments across campus were invited to become faculty in the Center to help recruit new core faculty and to accept graduate students into their labs for training. A $10 million bequest from Olympic gold medalist and 8-time Wimbledon champion Helen Wills Moody endowed the graduate program and provided cash support to grow the Center. On July 1, 2000, it was formally renamed the Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute (HWNI) in honor of this bequest. The Neuroscience PhD Program accepted its first class in Fall 2001. At any time there are approximately 60 graduate students in the department. The institute now encompasses over 70 research faculty from many departments including: Molecular & Cellular Biology, Psychology, Integrative Biology, Vision Science, Chemical Engineering, Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, Physics, and Environmental Science, Policy & Management, Haas School
