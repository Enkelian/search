Can't Stop Fallin' into Love
"Can't Stop Fallin' into Love" is a song by the American rock band Cheap Trick, released in 1990 as the lead single from their eleventh studio album Busted. It was written by guitarist Rick Nielsen, lead singer Robin Zander and bassist Tom Petersson, and produced by Richie Zito.Following the band's commercial comeback with Lap of Luxury in 1988, "Can't Stop Fallin' into Love" and its parent album Busted attempted to capitalize on the previous album's success. The song reached No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100, which was considered disappointing to Epic. It would be Cheap Trick's last single to reach the Top 40. Background "Can't Stop Fallin' into Love" was originally written as an instrumental track in early 1987. Once the band had added lyrics, the song was demoed in Milwaukee, with blues singer/songwriter Harvey Scales on vocals. Soon after, Zander presented a copy of the demo to Rod Stewart and although the singer expressed interest in recording the song for his upcoming album, Epic blocked the deal as they felt Cheap Trick should record and release their own version instead.A music video was filmed to promote the single, which featured regularly on MTV. It was directed by Nigel
