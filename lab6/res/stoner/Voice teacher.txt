A voice teacher or singing teacher is a musical instructor who assists adults and children in the development of their abilities in singing. Typical work A voice teacher works with a student singer to improve the various skills involved in singing.These skills include breath control and support, tone production and resonance, pitch control and musical intonation, proper formation of vowels and consonants as well as clarity of words, blending the various high and low ranges of a voice (called "registration"),, an attentiveness to musical notation and phrasing, the learning of songs, as well as good posture and vocal health . The voice teacher might operate in a private studio or be affiliated with a college or university faculty. Roles Students usually start vocal instruction after their voices have settled in later teen years. Part of the job of any voice teacher is to know a student's vocal characteristics sufficiently well to identify their voice type. Women are usually classified in one of three categories: soprano, mezzo-soprano, and contralto. Men's voices are divided into four categories: countertenor, tenor, baritone, and bass. However, more mature and experienced singers who have completed their professional training can usually benefit from ongoing vocal instruction. At
