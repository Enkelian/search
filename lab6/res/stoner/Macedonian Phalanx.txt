Macedonian Phalanx
The Macedonian phalanx (Greek: Μακεδονική φάλαγγα) is an infantry formation developed by Philip II and used by his son Alexander the Great to conquer the Achaemenid Empire and other armies. Phalanxes remained dominant on battlefields throughout the Ancient Macedonian Period, although wars had developed into more protracted operations generally involving sieges and naval combat as much as pitched battles, until they were ultimately displaced by the Roman legions. Development In 359 BC following the Macedonian defeat from the Illyrians which killed the majority of Macedonia's army and the current King Perdiccas III, Perdiccas' brother Philip II took the throne. Philip II was a hostage in Thebes for much of his youth (367-360), where he witnessed the combat tactics of the general Epaminondas, which then influenced his restructuring of the infantry. Philip's military reforms were a new approach to the current hoplite warfare which focused on their shield, the hoplon; his focus was on a new weapon, the sarissa. The first phalanx was a 10 by 10 square with very few experienced troops. The phalanx was later changed to a 16 by 16 formation, and while the date for this change is still unknown, it occurred before 331 under Philip’s rule.
