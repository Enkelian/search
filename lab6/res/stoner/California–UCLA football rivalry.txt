California–UCLA football rivalry
The California–UCLA football rivalry is an American college football rivalry between the California Golden Bears football team of the University of California, Berkeley and UCLA Bruins football team of the University of California, Los Angeles.Traditionally, the Cal–UCLA rivalry was played on "All-University Weekend". During the same week, UCLA and Cal would play each other in the other sports in season, and the schools would host festivals celebrating the achievements of the UC System. Played annually since 1933, it is the third-longest never-interrupted rivalry in college football, behind only Iowa State vs. Kansas State (uninterrupted since 1917), and Navy vs. Notre Dame (uninterrupted since 1927). Due to the two teams nicknames being named after bears, it is sometimes referred to as the Bear Bowl by some fans. Game results See also List of NCAA college football rivalry games == References ==
