1982 Los Angeles Dodgers season
The 1982 Los Angeles Dodgers entered the season as the defending World Series champions. They would remain in contention until the final day of the regular season, when the San Francisco Giants would knock them out of the National League West division race, in a season that saw the Atlanta Braves reach the playoffs instead. The Dodgers finished second in the National League West at 88â€“74, becoming the fifth team since 1969 to miss the playoffs one year after winning the World Series. This was the final L.A. season for longtime cornerstones Steve Garvey and Ron Cey, who would move on to new teams next season. The Dodgers did welcome new second baseman Steve Sax, who won the Rookie of the Year Award.
