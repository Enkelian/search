Wayne County & the Electric Chairs
Wayne County & the Electric Chairs were part of the first wave of punk bands from the 1970s. The band was headed by Georgia-born singer Jayne County. The band became known for their campy and foul-mouthed ballads, Glam punk inspired songs, and image which was heavily influenced by Jackie Curtis and the Theatre of the Ridiculous. They are best known for the 1977 single "Fuck Off." Career Jayne County, then known as Wayne County, had originally begun performing in New York with a band called Queen Elizabeth, followed by Wayne County and The Backstreet Boys which was documented on Rhino's DIY: Blank Generation compilation album with an early single, "Max's Kansas City 1976". Upon moving to London, England, with Greg Van Cook, a member of the Backstreet Boys, she recruited a new drummer and bassist to form "The Electric Chairs", with the band comprising Van Cook (guitar), Val Haller (bass) and Chris Dust (hu) (drums). Jools Holland had his first studio session with the group in 1976. None of County's albums were ever released in her native country of the United States, except for three songs on the very early punk compilation, Max's Kansas City. Wayne County and the Electric
