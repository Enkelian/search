Smokin' (Boston song)
"Smokin'" is a rock song by the American rock band Boston, released as the b-side to the band's first single, "More Than a Feeling." Like most of the tracks from the group's debut album, it has become a staple on classic rock radio. It has also been covered by other bands, including Anthrax. History The song was a collaborative effort between Tom Scholz, the band's mastermind, and recently hired lead singer Brad Delp, and one of the two songs on the first Boston LP not written by Scholz alone. It was one of the songs Scholz started writing in the early 1970s several years prior to the release of Boston. From early demo tapes made in his basement, some with Delp, an early version of the song written and recorded in 1973, called "Shakin", appears from the Mother's Milk Sessions. This tape reveals that originally, the song had a different meaning. Reception Writing in 2008, Kevin Smith of the Arizona Daily Star described "Smokin'" as a "radio standard." MusicTap's review of Boston noted that "Smokin'" as one of the songs from the album to become an FM radio staple, helping the album sell 17 million copies. Scott Tady of Beaver
