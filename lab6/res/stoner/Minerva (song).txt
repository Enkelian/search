Minerva (song)
"Minerva" is a song by the American band Deftones and the lead single from their self-titled fourth studio album. Despite the album as a whole containing some of the band's heaviest work to date, "Minerva" itself has an uplifting alternative metal sound and has also been described as shoegaze. In 2016, Consequence of Sound placed "Minerva" at No. 12 in its article "The Top 20 Deftones Songs", with Jon Hadusek claiming that "[in] a way, Deftones brought shoegaze to the alternative metal mainstream with 'Minerva', a crushingly heavy, textured jam indebted to Siamese Dream-era Smashing Pumpkins and Hum [...]". The song charted at No. 9 on Billboard's Alternative Songs chart, No. 16 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and No. 15 on the UK Singles Chart. Music video The video for "Minerva," directed by Paul Fedor, is notable for its similarity to Pink Floyd's Live at Pompeii concert film. The band is featured playing the song in a desert-like landscape backed by various amplifiers and other stage equipment. It was filmed near the Salton Sea in southern California in 2003, during a sandstorm. The filming process itself was fraught with problems, as the sand caused problems with the recording equipment
