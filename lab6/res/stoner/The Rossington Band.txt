The Rossington Band
Rossington is a blues rock group formed by Gary Rossington, of Lynyrd Skynyrd fame, and his wife Dale Krantz-Rossington after the breakup of The Rossington-Collins Band. History In 1982, having fallen in love, Gary and Dale were married. This marriage, in conjunction with the death of Allen Collins' wife and an unsuccessful second album, contributed to the demise of the Rossington-Collins Band. Not to be deterred, Gary and Dale formed a new group, simply called The Rossington Band. The band released their debut album, Returned to the Scene of the Crime in 1986. Two years later, the band would shorten its name to simply Rossington and release a second album, Love Your Man. After a 28 year hiatus, a new Rossington album was released in November 2016 called Take It On Faith. Discography Returned to the Scene of the Crime (1986)Love Your Man (1988)Take It On Faith (2016)
