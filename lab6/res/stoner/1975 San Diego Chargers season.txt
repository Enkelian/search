1975 San Diego Chargers season
The 1975 San Diego Chargers season was the franchise's sixth season in the National Football League (NFL), and its 16th overall. The team failed to improve on their 5–9 record in 1974. The Chargers lost their first eleven games amidst attendances under 30,000, along with considerable off-field problems as several regular players wanted to leave and the franchise knew it would not get the first choice in the 1976 draft due to the expansion Seahawks and Buccaneers. By the beginning of December, the prospect of the first winless and tieless season since World War II loomed, and led to serious discussion of the Chargers’ plight in the press – although that press acknowledged that even with three games to go the Chargers had a genuine chance to win facing fellow cellar-dwellers the Jets and Kansas City. The Chargers eventually finished 2–12, tying the New Orleans Saints for the NFL’s worst record. The team suffered badly from injuries, most critically running back Don Woods, who had been AFC Rookie of the Year in 1974, but played only the first four games in this season. 1975 would remain as the Chargers’ poorest until a 1–15 disaster in 2000.
