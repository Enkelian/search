History The roots of Project Blowed can be traced back to the former Good Life Cafe, a health food center in then called South Central Los Angeles, California. It was described by UGSMAG as "a platform for rappers to perform their material" and "a testing ground for Los Angeles' independent rap scene". Lenny Kravitz, Snoop Dogg, and Ice Cube reportedly attended the open-mic.In 1994, Aceyalone and Abstract Rude produced the original Project Blowed compilation album. It was released in 1995. In 2005, Project Blowed released a follow up album, Project Blowed: 10th Anniversary, on Decon. Social impact Project Blowed is the essential outlet for much of the LA underground hip hop culture. It is a place that many people of all genders can go to freestyle, rhyme, or just speak what is on their mind. Project Blowed was a turning point for the underground culture; it â€œdid not fan the flames of urban decay and societal attacks. Project Blowed
