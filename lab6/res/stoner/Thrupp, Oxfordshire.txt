Thrupp, Oxfordshire
Thrupp is a hamlet just north of Kidlington in Oxfordshire. It is beside the Oxford Canal and close to the River Cherwell. History Before the Norman conquest of England in 1066 Stigand, Archbishop of Canterbury held the manor of Thrupp. In 1070 Stigand was deposed and William the Conqueror confiscated his lands. William granted Thrupp to Roger d'Ivry, who sold it to Wadard, a knight in William's court. In 1086 Thrupp was such a small settlement that the Domesday Book did not record it as having any tenants.Thrupp has the remains of a 15th century cross carved from local Jurassic limestone. The cross itself has been lost, but the base and rather weathered shaft survive.The present Manor Farm buildings date from the early part of the 17th century. As well as the farmhouse there are a granary and dovecote from the same period. The farm used to have a watermill powered by the River Cherwell.In 1788 the Oxford Canal was extended southwards from Northbrook Lock just north of Tackley towards Kidlington and Oxford. It roughly parallels the River Cherwell until Thrupp, where it turns away from the river in a right-angle around Manor Farm in order to approach Oxford along
