Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry of USC
The Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry is the dental school of the University of Southern California. It was established in 1897 as simply the "University of Southern California School of Dentistry," and graduated its first class of 11 students in 1900. In 2010, the school was renamed after a $35 million donation by a USC alumnus, and the school was renamed for its benefactor, Herman Ostrow. Dr. Ostrow was a School of Dentistry of USC alumnus who graduated in 1945. He practiced with the profession of dentistry for 17 years before getting into real estate development in the Los Angeles area, where he made most of his earnings. The Herman Ostrow School of Dentistry offers online dental master degrees and certificate programs in Orofacial Pain and Oral Medicine, Oral Pathology and Radiology, Geriatric Dentistry, Community Oral Health, and a Pain Medicine program in partnership with the Keck School of Medicine of USC.
