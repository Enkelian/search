Kev Hopper
Kev Hopper (born 1961) is an English bass guitarist. Life and career Hopper is probably best known as the bass guitarist with the Anglo/Irish Captain Beefheart-inspired London band, Stump. Since the mid-1980s, Hopper's mainly instrumental output has been diverse and best described as a hybrid style of experimental and melodic pop with his distinctive bass playing often to the fore. He has also created pure electronica with the group Ticklish and minimal pulse music with the band, Prescott. In 2012, Hopper formed 'Prescott', with Scritti Politti keyboardist Rhodri Marsden, drummer Frank Byng, and adding Pere Ubu guitarist, Keith Molin√© in 2016.
