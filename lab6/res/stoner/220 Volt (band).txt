220 Volt (band)
220 Volt is a Swedish heavy metal band, formed in 1979 by guitar players Thomas Drevin and Mats Karlsson. The band released albums on the CBS Records and Epic Records labels. The band's career began in 1979, but began to flow when they released the first single "Prisoner Of War" in 1982. When a radio station in New Jersey played the single it soon became one of the most wanted songs, the record company CBS then offered them a record contract. The first "220 Volt" disc was released in 1983 and it sold around 10,000 copies only in Sweden alone. In addition to Sweden, the band has been very popular in Japan, Germany and the United States. In 1984, the band performed with Nazareth (12 concerts) and 1986 with AC / DC (7 concerts). These gigs increased the bands popularity. In 1992, the 220 volt disbanded, but in 2002, the band was reunited with the same lineup as on their first single. They organized popular concerts both in JÃ¤mtland and elsewhere in Sweden. Volume 1 was the first recording released in the 2000s, it contains both new material and parts of a concert from Sweden Rock 2002. The printed edition
