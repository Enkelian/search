Comarca
A comarca (Spanish: [koˈmaɾka], Portuguese: [kuˈmaɾkɐ] or [koˈmaʁkɐ]) is a traditional region or local administrative division found in Portugal, Spain and some of their former colonies: Panama, Nicaragua, and Brazil. The term is derived from the term marca, meaning a "march, mark", plus the prefix co-, meaning "together, jointly". The comarca is known in Aragonese as redolada (IPA: [reðoˈlaða]) and in Basque as eskualde (IPA: [es̺kualde]). In addition, in Galician, comarcas are also called bisbarras (IPA: [bizˈβarɐs]). Although the English word county and its near synonym shire have similar meanings, they are usually translated into Spanish as condado, a term which in Iberia only refers to regions historically ruled by a count. However, "comarca" is occasionally used: examples include the Spanish Wikipedia entry for "comarca" and some translations of The Lord of the Rings (see below). Angola According to the new judicial division of 2015, Angola (a Portuguese-speaking country) will be subdivided into 60 comarcas, each with a court of first instance.
