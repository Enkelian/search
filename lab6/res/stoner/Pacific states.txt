Pacific states
The West Pacific States form one of the nine geographic divisions within the United States that are officially recognized by that country's census bureau. There are five states in this division – Alaska, California, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington – and, as its name suggests, they all have coastlines on the [[Pacific p different from one another in many vital respects, most notably in the arena of politics; while nearly all of the Mountain states are regarded as being conservative "red states", four out of five of the Pacific states (all except Alaska) are clearly counted among the liberal "blue states". Territories Although not states, the three inhabited pacific U.S. territories (American Samoa, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands) and the pacific U.S. Minor Outlying Islands (excluding Navassa Island) are sometimes grouped with Pacific states in statistics.
