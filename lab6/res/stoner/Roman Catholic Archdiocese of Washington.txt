Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington
The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington (or the Archdiocese of Washington) is a particular church of the Roman Catholic Church in the United States. It comprises the District of Columbia and Calvert, Charles, Montgomery, Prince George's and Saint Mary's counties in the state of Maryland. It was originally part of the Archdiocese of Baltimore. This Archdiocese crosses a state line. Three other U.S. Roman-rite dioceses (Wilmington, Norwich, Gallup) also do this, but they each have territory in more than one state. The Archdiocese of Washington is home to The Catholic University of America, the only national university operated by the bishops conference of the United States and Georgetown University, the oldest Catholic and Jesuit institution of higher education in the country. In addition, the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, a minor basilica dedicated to the nation's patroness, the Immaculate Conception, is located within and administered by it, and it is not the Archdiocesan cathedral (nor even a parish of the Archdiocese). The cathedral of the archdiocese is the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle in downtown Washington.
