America the Beautiful Quarters
The America the Beautiful quarters (sometimes abbreviated ATB quarters) are a series of 25-cent pieces (quarters) issued by the United States Mint starting in 2010 and scheduled to continue until 2021. The obverse (front) of all the coins depicts George Washington in a modified version of the portrait used for the original 1932 Washington quarter. There will be five new reverse (back) designs each year (one in 2021), each commemorating a national park or national site – one from each state, the federal district, and each territory. The program is authorized by the America’s Beautiful National Parks Quarter Dollar Coin Act of 2008. Coin designs Quarters will be issued with reverse designs commemorating national parks and sites in the order of which that park or site was deemed a national site. The quarters from three different states will depict parks or sites that were previously portrayed on the state quarters (Grand Canyon in Arizona, Yosemite in California, and Mount Rushmore in South Dakota). While they will depict the same sites, they bear new designs. Mint marks As of 2019, four mint marks have been used on the America the Beautiful quarters. Quarters produced at the Philadelphia and Denver Mints feature
