Super Bowl LVIII
Super Bowl LVIII, the 58th Super Bowl and the 54th modern-era National Football League (NFL) championship game, will decide the league champion for the 2023 NFL season. The game is scheduled to be played on February 4, 2024, at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana (with the exact date pending potential changes to the NFL calendar). It will be the eleventh Super Bowl hosted by New Orleans, the previous one being Super Bowl XLVII in 2013. Host selection Super Bowl LVIII, along with Super Bowl LVII, was part of a new awarding process implemented by the league. In the previous process, cities that wished to host a Super Bowl submitted bids, which were deliberated and voted upon at the league owners' meetings. The new process no longer allows cities to bid for the game; the league now chooses the potential candidates. On May 23, 2018, the league selected New Orleans as the site for Super Bowl LVIII.
