Groupie
The term groupie is a slang word that refers to a fan of a particular musician, celebrity, or musical group who follows this person or band around while they are on tour or who attends as many of their public appearances as possible, usually in hopes of getting to meet them. The term is often used in a gendered fashion, to describe young women who follow these individuals in hopes of establishing a sexual relationship with them or offering sex. The term is used to describe fans of music and sports, and admirers of public figures in other high-profile professions. It may have a pejorative connotation, due to a perception that some groupies may be sexually promiscuous. Origin in music The word groupie originated around 1965 to describe teen-aged girls or young women who sought brief liaisons with musicians. The phenomenon was much older; Mary McCarthy had earlier described it in her novel The Company She Keeps (1942). Some sources have attributed the coining of the word to the Rolling Stones bassist Bill Wyman during the group's 1965 Australian tour; but Wyman said he and his bandmates used other "code words" for women on tour.A prominent explanation of the groupie
