Barton Coliseum
Barton Coliseum is a 7,150-seat multi-purpose arena located within the Arkansas State Fairgrounds in Little Rock, Arkansas. The coliseum was dedicated on September 29, 1952 in honor of Thomas Harry Barton, founder of Lion Oil.It is the former home of the Arkansasâ€“Little Rock Trojans basketball team, the defunct Arkansas GlacierCats of the WPHL (now defunct) and the defunct Arkansas Impact of the PBL. The Trojans moved into Alltel Arena, when it opened in 1999 and remained there, until the team moved into Jack Stephens Center in 2005. Prior to the Trojans' move to the Sun Belt Conference, the venue hosted five Trans America Athletic Conference (TAAC) men's basketball tournaments in 1983, 1986, 1987, 1989 and 1990. It has since hosted three Sun Belt Conference men's basketball tournaments. During the annual Arkansas State Fair, the coliseum is the venue for the fair's rodeo events. Additionally, it is used as the location throughout the year for spectator events featuring monster trucks, motorcycle acrobatics, and other shows. Countless rock concerts were held here until the completion of Alltel Arena. This fan-friendly site sold general admission tickets so that hardcore fans arriving hours before the doors opened could just about guarantee themselves a spot
