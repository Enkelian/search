Beastie Boys
The Beastie Boys were an American hip hop group from New York City formed in 1978. The group was composed of Michael "Mike D" Diamond (vocals, drums), Adam "MCA" Yauch (vocals, bass) and Adam "Ad-Rock" Horovitz (vocals, guitar, programming). The Beastie Boys were formed as a four-piece experimental hardcore punk band, the Young Aborigines, in 1978 by Mike D (vocals), Jeremy Shatan (bass), John Berry (guitar) and Kate Schellenbach (drums). When Shatan left the Young Aborigines in 1981, Adam Yauch replaced him on bass and the band changed their name to the Beastie Boys. Berry left shortly thereafter and was replaced by Horovitz. After achieving local success with the 1983 experimental hip hop single "Cooky Puss", the Beastie Boys made a full transition to hip hop, and Schellenbach left the group soon after. They toured with Madonna in 1985 and a year later released their debut album Licensed to Ill, which is notable for being the first rap record to top the Billboard 200 chart. The group had since released seven more albums: Paul's Boutique (1989), Check Your Head (1992), Ill Communication (1994), Hello Nasty (1998), To the 5 Boroughs (2004), The Mix-Up (2007), and Hot Sauce Committee Part Two
