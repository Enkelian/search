Trirhenium nonachloride
Trirhenium nonachloride is a compound with the formula ReCl3, sometimes also written Re3Cl9. It is a dark red hygroscopic solid that is insoluble in ordinary solvents. The compound is important in the history of inorganic chemistry as an early example of a cluster compound with metal-metal bonds. It is used as a starting material for synthesis of other rhenium complexes. Structure and physical properties As shown by X-ray crystallography trirhenium nonachloride consists of Re3Cl12 subunits that share three chloride bridges with adjacent clusters. The interconnected network of clusters forms sheets. Around each Re center are seven ligands, four bridging chlorides, one terminal chloride, and two Re-Re bonds. The heat of oxidation is evaluated according to the equation: 1/3 Re3Cl9 + 4 OH− + 2 OCl− → ReO4− + 2 H2O + 5Cl−The enthalpy for this process is 190.7 ± 0.2 kcal/mol. Preparation and reactions The compound was discovered in 1932, although these workers did not determine its structure, which is unusual for metal chlorides. Trirhenium nonachloride is efficiently prepared by thermal decomposition of rhenium pentachloride or hexachlororhenic(IV) acid: 3 ReCl5 → Re3Cl9 + 3 Cl2If the sample is vacuum sublimed at 500 °C, the resulting material is comparatively unreactive, but
