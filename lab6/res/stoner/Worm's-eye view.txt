Worm's-eye view
A worm's-eye view is a view of an object from below, as though the observer were a worm; the opposite of a bird's-eye view.It can be used to look up to something to make an object look tall, strong, and mighty while the viewer feels childlike or powerless.A worm's eye view commonly uses three-point perspective, with one vanishing point on top, one on the left, and one on the right.
