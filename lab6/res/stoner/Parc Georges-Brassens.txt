Parc Georges-Brassens
Parc Georges-Brassens is a public park located in the 15th arrondissement of Paris, between rue des Morillons and rue de Périchaux. Opened in 1984, it occupies 7.74 hectares on the site of a former fish market, horse market and slaughterhouse, and preserves some of the old market structures. It is named for the French popular singer Georges Brassens (1921–1981) who lived in the neighborhood of the park at 9 impasse Florimont and 42 rue Santos Dumont. The nearest metro stations to the park are Convention and Porte-de-Vanves. History The markets and slaughterhouse had been built on the site between 1894 and 1897, and were gradually closed down between 1969 and 1979. The city of Paris considered first using the site for public housing or a sports complex, but engineers discovered that the ground was unstable due the presence of abandoned quarries, and would have involved considerable improvements, so it was decided to build a park instead.The new park was designed by the architects Ghiulamila and Milliex and the landscape architect Collin. After the public outcry that followed the destruction of the structures of the old Paris central market, Les Halles, the architects decided to keep some of the original structures
