London Tonight
ITV News London is the regional news service for the ITV London region (previously Carlton/LWT), produced by ITN. History LNN The programme launched on Monday 4 January 1993 as London Tonight, after Carlton Television won the London weekday franchise from previous holder Thames Television. London Tonight was originally produced by London News Network â€“ a joint venture between Carlton and LWT designed to provide a sole ITV regional news service for the London area, broadcasting seven days a week. Its creation established a continuity between the once separate services and presentation of weekend and weekday news, weather and sport in the region, previously provided by Thames News and LWT News. The flagship programme, initially an hour long and presented by Alastair Stewart and Fiona Foster, was supplemented by shorter London Today bulletins, launched on New Year's Day 1993 (LWT discontinued its own local news service over the weekend). The main evening programme was reduced to 30 minutes a year later, while from 25 November 1996 to September 2001, a half-hour lunchtime edition of London Today was broadcast on weekdays. In addition to regional news, London News Network also produced a wide range of regional programming for both Carlton and LWT
