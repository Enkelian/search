No Age
No Age is an American noise rock duo consisting of guitarist Randy Randall and drummer/vocalist Dean Allen Spunt. The band is based in Los Angeles, California, and was signed to Sub Pop records from 2008 to 2013. Its fifth studio album, Snares Like a Haircut, was released by Drag City on January 26, 2018. History Formation, EPs, and Weirdo Rippers No Age formed in December 2005 out of the ashes of their previous band, Wives, in which Dean played bass and sang and Randy played guitar. They played their first show at the New Image Art gallery for a show curated by friend and artist Rich Jacobs on January 22, 2006. Their second show was at The Smell in April 2006 with Mika Miko, BARR and more. "The Smell is where we got to experiment. It pushed the boundaries of whatever ideas we had about music and artâ€”and we had a community to try out these new ideas," Randall told Drew Tewksbury in 2008. The band recorded 5 limited edition vinyl singles and EPs, and released them on 5 different labels on or around the same day, March 26, 2007.
