Glenmont (Washington Metro)
Glenmont is a Washington Metro station in Montgomery County, Maryland on the Red Line. It is the northeastern terminus of the Red Line. The station, located at Georgia Avenue and Layhill Road, serves the suburbs of Glenmont and Aspen Hill. Service began on July 25, 1998. History Early planning Glenmont was planned to be the location of the end of a line in the original layout of the Metrorail system that was approved in 1968. Two months later, the Glenmont Vicinity Citizens Association and several other citizens' groups attempted to have the line end at Silver Spring instead because they did not want the added development and they thought the extended lines would be too expensive. There were also concerns that the line would eventually be extended to Olney, which would change its rural character. The House Interior Appropriates Subcommittee was not convinced, and the plan went along unchanged. At the time, the station was planned to open in 1979.As of 1970, the site for building the station was vacant land zoned for residential use and owned by Georgia Avenue Baptist Church. Safeway wanted to build a supermarket on the site, and it petitioned the county to change the site
