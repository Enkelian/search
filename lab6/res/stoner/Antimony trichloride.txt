Antimony trichloride
Antimony trichloride is the chemical compound with the formula SbCl3. The soft colorless solid with a pungent odor was known to the alchemists as butter of antimony. Preparation Antimony trichloride is prepared by reaction of chlorine with antimony, antimony tribromide, antimony trioxide, or antimony trisulfide. It also may be made by treating antimony trioxide with concentrated hydrochloric acid. Reactions SbCl3 is readily hydrolysed and samples of SbCl3 must be protected from moisture. With a limited amount of water it forms antimony oxychloride releasing hydrogen chloride: SbCl3 + H2O → SbOCl + 2 HClWith more water it forms Sb4O5Cl2 which on heating to 460° under argon converts to Sb8O11Cll2.SbCl3 readily forms complexes with halides, but the stoichiometries are not a good guide to the composition, for example the (C5H5NH)SbCl4 contains a chain anion with distorted SbIII octahedra. Similarly the salt (C4H9NH3)2SbCl5 contains a polymeric anion of composition [SbCl52−]n with distorted octahedral SbIII.With nitrogen donor ligands, L, complexes with a stereochemically active lone-pair are formed, for example Ψ-trigonal bipyramidal LSbCl3 and Ψ-octahedral L2SbCl3.SbCl3 is only a feeble Lewis base, however some complexes are known for example the carbonyl complexes, Fe(CO)3(SbCl3)2 and Ni(CO)3SbCl3. Structure In the gas phase SbCl3 is pyramidal with a
