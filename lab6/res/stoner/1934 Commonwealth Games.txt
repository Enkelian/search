1934 Commonwealth Games
The 1934 British Empire Games were the second of what is now known as the Commonwealth Games, held in England, from 4–11 August 1934. The host city was London, with the main venue at Wembley Park, although the track cycling events were in Manchester. Seventeen national teams took part, including the Irish Free State (the only Games in which they participated, although at the 1930 Games, a team representing the whole of Ireland competed). The 1934 Games had originally been awarded to Johannesburg, South Africa, but the venue was later changed to London due to concerns regarding the treatment of black and Asian athletes by South African officials and fans.Six sports were featured in the Games: athletics in White City Stadium; boxing, wrestling, and aquatics (swimming and diving) in the Empire Pool and Arena, Wembley; cycling in Fallowfield Stadium, Manchester; and lawn bowls at Paddington and Temple. Women's events in athletics were held for the first time; the previous games had women's events only in swimming and diving.
