Lime Pictures, formerly known as Mersey Television, is a British television production company, founded by producer and writer Phil Redmond in the early 1980s. They produce award winning drama and entertainment shows for the international market including Hollyoaks, The Only Way is Essex, Geordie Shore and Free Rein. Productions The company's first major production was the soap opera Brookside for Channel 4, which ran from the channel's foundation in 1982 until 2003, when it was taken off air due to declining ratings. A 3-part spin-off ('soap bubble') of Brookside was produced in November 1987 called Damon and Debbie.
