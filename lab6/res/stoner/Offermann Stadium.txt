Offermann Stadium
Offermann Stadium was a stadium located in Buffalo, New York. It was primarily used for baseball and was the home of Buffalo Bisons of the International League. The ballpark had a capacity of 14,000 people and opened in 1924. It was located on the block bounded by East Ferry Street (north, third base), Masten Avenue (east, left field), Woodlawn Avenue (south, right field) and Michigan Avenue (west, first base). History The site on the corner of East Ferry and Michigan Avenue had been in use as a baseball venue since 1889. Olympic Park (II) was constructed on the site in that year, replacing Olympic Park (I) as the Bisons' home ballpark. In 1907 the club began calling their home "Buffalo Baseball Park", with the name "Olympic Park" slowly fading from use over the years. The wooden stands, which had been transported from its predecessor, served as the Bisons' home stadium through the early part of the 1923 season. Construction of a new steel-and-concrete structure was well under way by the end of the 1923 season, and the finished stadium opened in the spring of 1924. It was initially called Bison Stadium, and was renamed in memory of owner Frank J.
