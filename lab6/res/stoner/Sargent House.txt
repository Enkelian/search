Sargent House
Sargent House is an American management company and record label based in Los Angeles. It was founded in June 2006 by Cathy Pellow, who is a music video commissioner for Atlantic Records and also owns a music video production company called Refused TV. Pellow began managing the rock outfit RX Bandits in 2006.

From that point onward, Pellow continued to manage bands and release records, all under the Sargent House banner. Chronologically from when Pellow first began working with them, Sargent House manages the RX Bandits, These Arms Are Snakes, Maps & Atlases, Russian Circles, Tera Melos, Fang Island, Daughters, Red Sparowes, Good Old War, Native, This Town Needs Guns, Bygones, Lisa Papineau, Big Sir, Cast Spells, Zechs Marquise, Zach Hill, Le Butcherettes, Adebisi Shank, Hella, And So I Watch You From Afar and Helms Alee.
