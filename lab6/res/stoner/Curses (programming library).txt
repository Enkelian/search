Curses (programming library)
curses is a terminal control library for Unix-like systems, enabling the construction of text user interface (TUI) applications. The name is a pun on the term “cursor optimization”. It is a library of functions that manage an application's display on character-cell terminals (e.g., VT100). Overview Using curses, programmers are able to write text-based applications without writing directly for any specific terminal type. The curses library on the executing system sends the correct control characters based on the terminal type. It provides an abstraction of one or more windows that maps onto the terminal screen. Each window is represented by a character matrix. The programmer sets up the desired appearance of each window, then tells the curses package to update the screen. The library determines a minimal set of changes that are needed to update the display and then executes these using the terminal's specific capabilities and control sequences. In short, this means that the programmer simply creates a character matrix of how the screen should look and lets curses handle the work. The curses API is described in several places. Most implementations of curses use a database that can describe the capabilities of thousands of different terminals. There are a
