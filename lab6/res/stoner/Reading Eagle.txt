After celebrating its sesquicentennial of local ownership and editorial control in 2018, the Reading Eagle was acquired by the Denver, Colorado-based MediaNews Group (also known as Digital First Media) in May 2019. History The newspaper was founded on January 28, 1868. Initially an afternoon paper, it was published Monday through Saturday with a Sunday morning edition added later. In 1940, the Eagle acquired the Reading Times, which was a morning paper, but they remained separate papers. The staff of the two papers was combined in 1982. In June 2002, the Reading Times ceased publishing, and the Eagle became a morning paper. Both papers had been publishing a joint Saturday morning edition since 1988. Author John Updike worked at the Eagle as a copyboy in his youth for several summer internships in the early 1950s, and wrote several feature articles.In 2009, the newspaper switched to a Berliner format and laid off 52 employees in late April of that year.After
