The One Thing (album)
The One Thing is the ninth album by Michael Bolton, released on November 16, 1993. Although it produced the hit single "Said I Loved You...But I Lied", which reached #6 in the U.S., it did not match the sales of his previous three albums. Nevertheless, the album was still a respectable hit on its own, reaching #3 on the Billboard 200 and being certified triple platinum in the U.S. It was also certified Platinum in the United Kingdom. Like his previous album, Bolton co-produced all the tracks and co-wrote all but two songs.
