Capital Xtra
Capital XTRA (originally Choice FM) is a Global-owned radio station that began broadcasting from London on 96.9 and 107.1 MHz in the FM band in 1990; alongside DAB Digital Radio, Freesat, Sky, Virgin Media and online nowadays. It is a radio station that exclusively broadcasts contemporary grime, hip hop and R&B music. History Choice 96.9 began as an independent company in March 1990, broadcasting from studios in Trinity Gardens, Brixton. It was Britainâ€™s first 24-hour black music radio station with a licence, covering South London. The group won a second licence (see Buzz FM) in 1995, bringing a local version of their London offering to Birmingham, on 102.2 FM - in place of Buzz FM. The advent of digital radio in the UK saw Choice, which already had an active webstream, joining the new MXR consortium and launching a DAB service which anchored London output with news inserts produced by the consortium's news service DNN. The Birmingham licence was sold to Chrysalis Radio in 1999 and became Galaxy Birmingham, but Choice expanded within the capital in May 2000 when a largely independent North London licence was awarded for Choice 107.1, with the intention of reaching a larger Afro-Caribbean audience outside
