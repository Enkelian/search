Amoeba Records
Amoeba Music is a US independent music chain with stores in Berkeley, San Francisco, and Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. It was founded in 1990 in Berkeley, CA and remains in operation, having survived the decline of CD sales in the 2000s. History Founded by former employees of nearby Rasputin Records, it opened on Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley in 1990. The stores are unusually large given their independent status. The San Francisco store, which opened in 1997 in the Haight-Ashbury district close to Golden Gate Park, is especially notable for its size, occupying a 24,000 square foot (2,200 mÂ²) former bowling alley. It regularly stocks upwards of 100,000 CDs, vinyl records, and audio cassettes, both new and used. It is still operating as of 2019, having survived the decline in CD sales since the early 2000s thanks to its thriving trade in used vinyl records.The Southern California location was added on November 17, 2001 when the store opened a new branch on Sunset Boulevard (at Cahuenga Boulevard) in Hollywood. At the time of its opening, the store planned to stock as many as 250,000 titles, which would have placed it among the largest independent music stores in the world. According to
