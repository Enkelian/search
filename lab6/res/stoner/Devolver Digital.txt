Devolver Digital
Devolver Digital is an American video game publisher based in Austin, Texas, specializing in the publishing of indie games. The company was founded in June 2009 by Mike Wilson, Harry Miller and Rick Stults, alongside business partners Nigel Lowrie and Graeme Struthers. The three founders had previously operated Gathering of Developers and Gamecock Media Group, which published games on developer-friendly terms, but due to the high cost associated with releasing retail games saw themselves acquired and dissolved by larger companies. To avoid this, Devolver Digital instead turned to digital distribution channels. Devolver Digital started by publishing high-definition remakes of games in the Serious Sam series of games. After success with these remakes and spin-off games based on the series, Devolver Digital began publishing games from other, smaller independent studios, one of the first being their breakout title, Hotline Miami. The company also operates Devolver Digital Films for film distribution, and majority-owns publisher Good Shepherd Entertainment. As of January 2020, Devolver Digital employs 20 people.
