Woodstock (song)
"Woodstock" is a popular song written by Joni Mitchell. Three versions of the song were released in the same year, 1970. The first, Mitchell's own, was included on her 1970 album Ladies of the Canyon and served as the B-side to her single "Big Yellow Taxi". The second release that year was by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young; their version has become a staple of classic rock radio and is the best-known version in the United States. The third version, by the British band Matthews Southern Comfort became the best known version in the United Kingdom, and was the highest charting version of the song, reaching the top of the UK pop charts in 1970. As the name implies, the lyrics refer to the Woodstock Music and Arts Festival of 1969, telling the story of a concert-goer on a trek to attend the festival. Mitchell, who was unable to perform at the festival herself due to scheduling conflicts, was inspired to write the song based on an account of the festival relayed to her by then-boyfriend Graham Nash, who had performed there. The anthemic song, as well as the festival it commemorates, is symbolic of the counterculture of the 1960s.
