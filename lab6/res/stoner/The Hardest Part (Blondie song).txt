The Hardest Part (Blondie song)
"The Hardest Part" is a 1979 song by the American new wave band Blondie. In North America, it was released as the second single from the band's fourth album Eat to the Beat (in Europe, "Union City Blue" was released as the second single). It was written by the group's principal songwriting partnership, Deborah Harry and Chris Stein. The single achieved minor success, reaching #84 and #86 on the Billboard Hot 100 and RPM 100 Singles respectively. Overview The song describes an armored car robbery. The title refers to the "hardest part" of the plan – progressing past several armed guards. It would be revealed much later in an interview, that the original working title for this song was The Stiffest Piece. Music video As with all songs on the album, a music video was produced to promote the single. It features Debbie Harry in a long dark wig wearing a dress designed by Anya Phillips, who also designed the pink dress featured on the cover of the band's 1977 album "Plastic Letters". The video was directed by David Mallett. Track listing US 7" (CHS 2408, February 1980) "The Hardest Part" (Deborah Harry, Chris Stein) – 3:42 "Sound-A-Sleep" (Deborah Harry,
