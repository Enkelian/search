2002 Los Angeles Dodgers season
The 2002 season saw Dan Evans take over as General Manager and in his first season the team won 92 games and was not eliminated from post season contention until the next-to-last day of the season, finishing third overall in the Western Division of the National League. Shawn Green hit 42 home runs to become the first L.A. Dodger to have back-to-back 40 or more homer seasons. He had four homers in one game on May 23 against the Milwaukee Brewers. He went 6 for 6 in that game and set a Major League mark for total bases with 19. The number broke the previous record of 18 total bases set by Joe Adcock. Éric Gagné who had been a starter previously became the closer in 2002 and set a club mark with 52 saves. This is also their first season to be broadcast on KCOP (13).
