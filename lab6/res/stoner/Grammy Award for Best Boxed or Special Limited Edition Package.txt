Grammy Award for Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package
The Grammy Award for Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package has been presented since 1995 to an album's art directors. The award is not bestowed upon or shared by the artist unless they are also a credited art director. The award year reflects the year of presentation, not the year the work was actually released. The award category has previously been known as Best Recording Package – Boxed (1995–1997) and Best Boxed Recording Package (1998–2002). In 2016, the award was expanded from five nominees to six.
