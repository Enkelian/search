Hook Norton
Hook Norton is a village and civil parish in Oxfordshire, England. It is 4.5 miles (7.2 km) northeast of Chipping Norton and close to the Cotswold Hills. Many of its buildings are built of local ironstone. Toponymy In the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle in AD 922, the village is called Hocneratune. In the Domesday Book of 1086 it is called Hochenartone. Other historical spellings of the name include Hocceneretune (1050), Hogenarton (1216) and Okenardton (1263). Another variation may be 'Hegnorton' as seen in 1430. The name may possibly mean 'the farmstead of the Hoccanere tribe', the supposed tribal name deriving from the personal name 'Hocca' and Old English 'ora' (hill-slope), together with 'tun', settlement.Today the village is colloquially known to its inhabitants as "Hooky" and sometimes as "The Hook". The village is formed of four neighbourhoods: East End, Scotland End (in the west), Down End (in the centre) and Southrop (in the south). History The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that a Viking army raided the Hook Norton area in AD 913, and the village had a parish church by AD 922. The Domesday Book records that in 1086 Hook Norton had 76 villagers and two mills. Reports of a band of villagers arming
