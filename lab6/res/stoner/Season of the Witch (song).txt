Season of the Witch (song)
"Season of the Witch" is a psychedelic folk rock song by Scottish singer-songwriter Donovan and first released in September 1966 on his third American album, Sunshine Superman. The song is credited to Donovan, although sometime collaborator Shawn Phillips has also claimed authorship. Because of a dispute with Donovan's record company, a UK edition with the song was not released until June 1967. Several artists have recorded their own renditions, including Julie Driscoll with Brian Auger and the Trinity (1967, Open); Al Kooper with Steve Stills (1968, Super Session); and Lana Del Rey (2019, Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark soundtrack). Composition and recording "Season of the Witch" was recorded at the CBS studios in Hollywood, California, where most of Sunshine Superman was recorded. According to Donovan, he and Phillips wanted a "rock-combo sound" for the song and chose some local musicians from the local clubs. They included Lenny Maitlin on keyboards, Don Brown on lead electric guitar, Bobby Ray on bass and "Fast" Eddie Hoh on drums. Donovan played the second guitar part, as he explained in his autobiography: I played a white Fender Telecaster Electric Guitar on "Witch," chunking down on the chord pattern, wailing a chilling chorus.
