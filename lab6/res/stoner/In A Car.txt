In A Car
In a Car is the Meat Puppets' first recording and was originally issued on L.A. art collective/record label World Imitation records as a 5 track 7" EP. It was recorded in Silver Lake studio in Los Angeles on June 4, 1981, with Ed Barger (who had engineered several early Devo singles). In a Car was first re-issued as a 7" on SST Records in 1985 after the success of their early LPs. The EP was also included on an SST compilation cassette (and later cd) "The 7 Inch Wonders of the World". While the original EP featured only five tracks, six tracks were recorded at the session including the song "Hair" written by fellow World Imitation band Monitor. It was released as a lone Meat Puppets track on the first Monitor LP on World Imitation records. It was not on any Meat Puppets release until Rykodisc issued the song as a bonus track (with the entire first EP and many outtakes) on the 1999 reissue of the first LP, Meat Puppets.
