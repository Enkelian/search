The Peppered Moth
The Peppered Moth is a 2000 novel by English writer Margaret Drabble; it is her fourteenth published novel. The novel follows the fictional experiences of three generations of women within one family, and contains several elements that are loosely based on Drabble's own biographical experience. The novel received mixed reviews, with some authors noting the relative weakness of Drabble's blending of fictional and biographical elements. Background Drabble, in the afterword for the novel, describes it as a loose adaptation of her mother's life. Publisher's Weekly described the fictional representation of her mother, the protagonist Bessie Bawtry, as very unsympathetic and "thinly veiled". When discussing the investigation of matrilineal traits in the novel, critic Yi-Lin Yu describes the relationship between Drabble and the fictional representation of her mother as fraught. In part, the poor representation has a lot to do with the difficulty Drabble had in evoking her mother: she originally wrote the novel, upon urging of friends after her mother's death and in the afterword, she writes that her mother "was a highly intelligent, angry, deeply disappointed and manipulative woman. I am not sure if I have been able to find a tone in which to create or describe her."
