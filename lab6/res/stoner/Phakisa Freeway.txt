Phakisa Freeway
Phakisa Freeway is a motor racing circuit located between Welkom and Odendaalsrus, South Africa. It is one of the few oval speedways outside of the USA and the only one in Africa, although the oval has failed to host any meaningful racing in its 20 year history. History Phakisa Freeway was built on the same site as the former Goldfields Raceway, which closed in 1997.The current track opened in 1999. It consists of a 4.24 km road course and a 2.4-kilometre (1.5 mi) oval course. The road course uses the oval’s pit lane as its backstraight and crosses the oval’s backstretch on two times. The oval track is similar to the Las Vegas Motor Speedway in its 1997 configuration: 12 degree banking in the turns, nine degrees on the tri-oval and three degrees on the back stretch. It was built to attract American oval racing like NASCAR or IndyCar. Events From 1999 to 2004, the venue hosted the South African motorcycle Grand Prix of the MotoGP championship. The Superbike World Championship announced their intention to run at Phakisa Freeway from 2014 onwards. Due to homologation issues the series never raced at the circuit.Since 2014, Phakisa Freeway only hosted national events,
