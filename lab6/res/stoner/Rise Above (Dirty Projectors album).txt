Rise Above (Dirty Projectors album)
Rise Above is an album by indie rock band Dirty Projectors, released on September 11, 2007. The album was band leader Dave Longstreth's reinterpretation of Black Flag album Damaged, having not heard it in 15 years. The album features Longstreth on guitar and vocals, Amber Coffman on vocals and guitar, Brian McOmber on drums, Nat Baldwin on bass, and Susanna Waiche on vocals. Angel Deradoorian would join the band shortly before the Rise Above tour on bass and vocals. This album is the first that presents Dirty Projectors as a fully realized band rather than an individual project of Longstreth. Reception The record was generally well received by critics, maintaining a 78% positive rating at Metacritic. The album received particularly high ratings from The A.V. Club and Pitchfork. AllMusic called the album "a brave and ultimately successful experiment."
