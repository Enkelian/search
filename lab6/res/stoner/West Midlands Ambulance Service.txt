West Midlands Ambulance Service
The West Midlands Ambulance Service University NHS Foundation Trust (WMAS) is the second-largest ambulance service, and the first university ambulance trust in the UK. It is the authority responsible for providing NHS ambulance services within the West Midlands region of England. The Trust provides an extensive network of non-emergency patient transport services. Currently, contracts are operated in Birmingham, the Black Country, Arden and Cheshire. The contract for Worcestershire, which has been run by the ambulance service for 30 years, was lost to a private provider despite WMAS scoring more highly in the quality of patient services. This contract will be run until the end of March 2020. Each contract currently exceeds all of the performance metrics set by Commissioners. The trust is currently under the leadership of chief executive Anthony Marsh QAM, SBStJ, FASI, MBA, MSc, DSc h.c and chair Sir Graham Medlum . It is one of 10 Ambulance Trusts providing England with Emergency medical services, and is part of the National Health Service. There is no charge to patients for use of the service. WMAS was the highest-performing ambulance services in England and one of only two to exceed all of its national performance targets in 2018-19 It
