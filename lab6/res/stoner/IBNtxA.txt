IBNtxA
IBNtxA, or 3-iodobenzoyl naltrexamine, is an atypical opioid analgesic drug derived from naltrexone. In animal studies it produces potent analgesic effects that are blocked by levallorphan and so appear to be μ-opioid mediated, but it fails to produce constipation or respiratory depression, and is neither rewarding or aversive in conditioned place preference protocols. These unusual properties are thought to result from agonist action at a splice variant or heterodimer of the μ-opioid receptor, rather than at the classical full length form targeted by conventional opioid drugs. == References ==
