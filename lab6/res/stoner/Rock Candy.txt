The song still gets performed on Sammy Hagar's solo tours and even had been re-recorded as the b-side to the Hagar single "Little White Lie" by the original band. It was also included on Hagar's live release Live: Hallelujah. The song is well known for its distinctive drum intro played by Denny Carmassi.
