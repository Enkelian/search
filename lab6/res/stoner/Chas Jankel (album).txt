The first track on the album "Ai No Corrida", was covered by Quincy Jones a year later in 1981 and was a UK chart hit for him. The song has also been covered by the Nylons and Laura More with Uniting Nations. The album was re-issued in 2005 on Angel Air in the United Kingdom as a digitally remastered CD, featuring one bonus track, "Little Eva" which was co-written by Jankel with Ian Dury and was originally released on Jankel's 1985 album Looking at You. The track "Reverie" was used as a sample by Brooklyn-based hip hop collective Pro Era in the song, "Like Water", which is featured on the group's second mixtape as a collective, "P.E.E.P: The aPROcalypse" (2012).
