Uploaded
In computer networks, to upload is to send data to a remote system such as a server or another client so that the remote system can store a copy. Remote upload Transferring data from one remote system to another under the control of a local system is remote uploading. Remote uploading is used by some online file hosting services. It is also used when the local computer has a slow connection to the remote systems, but they have a fast connection between them. Without remote uploading functionality, the data would have to first be downloaded to the local host and then uploaded to the remote file hosting server, both times over slow connections See also Download Sideload Bandwidth == References ==
