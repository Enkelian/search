Huntingdon College
Huntingdon College is a private Methodist liberal arts college in Montgomery, Alabama. It was founded in 1854 as a women's college. History Huntingdon College was chartered on February 2, 1854, as "Tuskegee Female College" by the Alabama State Legislature and Governor John A. Winston. The first president was Andrew Adgate Lipscomb. Dr. Lipscomb laid the foundation of the college as a teaching college rather than a research institution. In 1872 the name was changed to "Alabama Conference Female College," as the college came under the auspices of the Methodist Episcopal Church. As the college and the South struggled to rebuild following the Civil War, college leaders believed they needed to relocate the institution to a more populous city, and they chose the state's capital, Montgomery. In 1908 they purchased a 58-acre (235,000 mÂ²) parcel of land on what was then the outskirts of town; it is now part of the Old Cloverdale neighborhood of Montgomery. The campus landscaping was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr., who had also planned the Biltmore Estate and Central Park. The college, renamed as "Woman's College of Alabama," moved all of its furniture, lab chemicals, and records into Hamner Hall in Montgomery on August 24,
