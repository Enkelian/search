Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council
The permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (also known as the Permanent Five, Big Five, or P5) are the five states which the UN Charter of 1945 grants a permanent seat on the UN Security Council: The People's Republic of China (formerly the Republic of China), the French Republic, the Russian Federation (formerly the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, aka the Soviet Union), the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the United States of America. These countries were all allies in World War II (and the victors of that war), and are also all states with nuclear weapons. The remaining 10 members of the UNSC are elected, giving a total of 15 UN member states. All five permanent members have the power of veto, which enables any one of them to prevent the adoption of any "substantive" draft Council resolution, regardless of its level of international support.
