It claims to be the United Kingdom's largest independent publisher in this field, publishing approximately 300 books per year and with a backlist of over 12,000 titles.Created in December 2007, The History Press integrated core elements of the NPI Media Group within it, including all existing published titles, plus all the future contracts and publishing rights contained in them. At the time of founding the imprints included Phillimore, Pitkin Publishing, Spellmount, Stadia, Sutton Publishing, Tempus Publishing and Nonsuch. History The roots of The History Press's publishing heritage can be traced back to 1897 when William Phillimore founded a publishing business which still carries his name, however the company itself evolved from the amalgamation of a number of smaller publishing houses in 2007 that formed part of the NPI Media Group. The largest component of the NPI Media Group was Tempus Publishing, founded by Alan Sutton in 1993. Tempus Publishing's early years were spent producing local history titles, principally books of old photographs depicting towns and villages throughout the UK. Tempus Publishing later opened offices in both the US and Europe,
