Tolotta Records
Tolotta Records was a record label run by Joe Lally of Fugazi. It was based in Arlington, Virginia and distributed through Dischord Records. The label has released bands from Washington, D.C. and the surrounding area, such as Dead Meadow and Spirit Caravan. The label was founded in 1994 and came to an end in 2002 when Spirit Caravan broke up and Dead Meadow moved to Matador Records. Shortly after Lally set-up the label, the German label Hellhound Records (who were heavily vested in the Maryland doom metal scene) disbanded, leaving Tolotta to pick up some of the slack. Tolotta re-released The Obsessed's first album (originally released by Hellhound) and picked up Scott Weinrich's new band, Shine, who later changed their name to Spirit Caravan.
