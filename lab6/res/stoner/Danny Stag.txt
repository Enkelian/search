Danny Stag (born Daniel Steigerwald in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) is an American hard rock guitarist who played with the band Kingdom Come and authored successful blues rock guitar instructional videos. Stag was noted for his soulful blues rock playing, a style that by the late 1980s had been somewhat of a lost art, with many hard rock guitarists at the time playing with a more technical approach. Prior to joining Kingdom Come, Stag played in L.A. based bands Population 5, and WWIII; along with future Kingdom Come bandmate, Johnny B. Frank, a former keyboard player for Josie Cotton.

The band's debut album Kingdom Come quickly climbed the billboard charts peaking at number 12, with worldwide sales greatly exceeding one million copies. Kingdom Come were one of five bands selected (Scorpions,
