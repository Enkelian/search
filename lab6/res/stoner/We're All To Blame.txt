We're All To Blame
"We're All to Blame" is a song by Canadian rock band Sum 41. "We're All to Blame" was released to radio on August 31, 2004 as the first single from Chuck. Content The band has stated that the song is about the "state of the world due to war, people dying, people living in fear, and the power of corporations, amongst other concerns." It was written after their trip to the Congo, making it the last song written for Chuck ("Noots" was originally going to be track 3 on the album, but was cut right after "We're All To Blame" was recorded). Music video The video, directed by Marc Klasfeld, is a spoof of Solid Gold and features the Solid Gold dancers. At the end of the video, the announcer says that the next guest is Pain For Pleasure, Sum 41's heavy metal alter ego band. Reception The song has received universal critical acclaim. Fox83 of Sputnikmusic called the song an "impressive approach lyrically" and said "If System of a Down's "Chop Suey!" had never been released then this could be leaning on originality. Aside from these irritations, 'We're All to Blame' is a great effort, and deserves its place
