Stones Throw Records is an American independent record label based in Los Angeles, California. Under the direction of founder Peanut Butter Wolf, Stones Throw has released music ranging from hip hop to experimental psychedelic rock. LA Weekly deemed the label an "eternally evolving experiment" in celebration of its 20th anniversary. History Chris Manak, known professionally as Peanut Butter Wolf, founded Stones Throw in 1996 as means of posthumously releasing his music with rapper Charles Edward Hicks Jr., known professionally as Charizma. Hicks and Manak met in 1989 at 16 and 19, respectively, and began collaborating as Charizma and Peanut Butter Wolf. The duo released one promo cassette of "Red Light Green Light" through Hollywood Basic—the now-defunct hip-hop subsidiary of Hollywood Records—before leaving the label. Their collaboration was cut short in 1993, when Hicks was fatally shot in a carjacking at the age of 20. Stones Throw's first release, "My World Premiere" by Charizma and Peanut Butter Wolf, arrived three years later.The label has released hip hop records including Madvillainy, the acclaimed debut from Madvillain (a collaboration between producer Madlib and MF DOOM) in 2004, and J Dilla's Donuts in 2006.
