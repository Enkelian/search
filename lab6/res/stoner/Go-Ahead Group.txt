History Incorporation The Go-Ahead Group plc began as Go-Ahead Northern Limited on 17 February 1987 on the privatisation of the National Bus Company, when a partial management buyout led by Martin Ballinger and Chris Moyes purchased its Gateshead-based northern division, known as the Northern General Transport Company. Early expansion saw the acquisition of certain smaller competing bus operators in North East England (principally Gypsy Queen in 1989 and Low Fell Coaches in June 1992). Go-Ahead Northern also became a National Express sub-contractor operating services to the Midlands, North East, North West and South West England. At the same time, Go-Ahead Leisure purchased a number of pubs, which were sold in February 1996. 1993: Expanding south Despite bidding for a number of other larger bus operators in the intervening period, Go-Ahead's first major acquisition was Brighton & Hove in November 1993, followed by the Oxford Bus Company and Wycombe Bus Company in March 1994.
