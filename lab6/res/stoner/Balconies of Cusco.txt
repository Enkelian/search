Balconies of Cusco
The balconies of Cusco are colonial balconies found in much of the city of Cusco, Cusco Region, Peru. These balconies are most dated to colonial times and some other to the early-Republican time. These constructions are located in the corners of colonial and republican palaces and convents of old streets. They are of Mud√©jar and Baroque styles. Some scientists say that these balconies have a type of discreet enclosure that kept women hidden from the sight of people in the exterior; in this way, these balconies or windows, served so that women could snoop without being seen from the street.Balconies are a typical colonial Peruvian feature that can be seen in other colonial towns of Peru.
