Apistogramma
Apistogramma is a large genus of freshwater fish in the family Cichlidae found in South America, but also commonly kept in aquariums. They are dwarf cichlids that mostly feed on tiny animals and have breeding behaviors that vary depending on the exact species. Range, conservation status and habitat Apistogramma are exclusively found in tropical and subtropical South America in the lowlands east of the Andes. The highest richness is in the western Amazon Basin and Orinoco Basin, but there are also species in the Guianan Shield, eastern Amazon Basin, rivers flowing into the Atlantic in northern Brazil (Tocantins–Araguaia to Parnaíba) and the Río de la Plata Basin. Although a few species are widespread, most members of this genus have small ranges. Few members of the genus have been evaluated by the IUCN, mostly either ranking as least concern (not threatened) or data deficient (limited available data prevents an evaluation), but some of the highly localized Apistogramma species likely are threatened. Primary threats to their survival are deforestation (causing changes in their microhabitat) and pollution (for example by oil drilling or mining).Apistogramma generally inhabit streams, or edges of rivers or lakes. Most prefer sheltered habitats with leaf litter on the bottom
