Jun-ichi Nishizawa
Jun-ichi Nishizawa (西澤 潤一, Nishizawa Jun'ichi, September 12, 1926 – October 21, 2018) was a Japanese engineer and inventor. He is known for his electronic inventions since the 1950s, including the PIN diode, static induction transistor, static induction thyristor, semiconductor laser, SIT/SITh, and fiber-optic communication. His inventions contributed to the development of internet technology and the information age.He was a professor at Sophia University. He is considered the "Father of Japanese Microelectronics". Biography Nishizawa was born in Sendai, Japan, on September 12, 1926. He earned a B.S. in 1948, and a Doctor of Engineering degree in 1960, from Tohoku University. In 1953, he joined the Research Institute of Electrical Communication at Tohoku University. He became a professor there and was appointed director to two research institutes. From 1990 to 1996, Nishizawa served as the President of Tohoku University. He became the president of Iwate Prefectural University in 1998. Research In 1950, the static induction transistor was invented by Jun-ichi Nishizawa and Y. Watanabe. The PIN photodiode was also invented by Nishizawa and his colleagues in 1950.In 1952, he invented the avalanche photodiode. He then invented a solid-state maser in 1955, followed by his invention of the semiconductor laser in 1957.While
