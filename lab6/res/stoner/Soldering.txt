Soldering
Soldering (AmE: , BrE: ) is a process in which two or more items are joined together by melting and putting a filler metal (solder) into the joint, the filler metal having a lower melting point than the adjoining metal. Unlike welding, soldering does not involve melting the work pieces. In brazing, the work piece metal also does not melt, but the filler metal is one that melts at a higher temperature than in soldering. In the past, nearly all solders contained lead, but environmental and health concerns have increasingly dictated use of lead-free alloys for electronics and plumbing purposes. Origins There is evidence that soldering was employed as early as 5,000 years ago in Mesopotamia. Soldering and brazing are thought to have originated very early in the history of metal-working, probably before 4000 BC. Sumerian swords from c. 3000 BC were assembled using hard soldering. Soldering was historically used to make jewelry items, cooking ware and tools, as well as other uses such as in assembling stained glass. Applications Soldering is used in plumbing, electronics, and metalwork from flashing to jewellery and musical instruments. Soldering provides reasonably permanent but reversible connections between copper pipes in plumbing systems as well
