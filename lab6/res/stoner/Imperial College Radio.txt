Imperial College Radio
Imperial College Radio or IC Radio is the student radio station at Imperial College London History IC Radio was founded in November 1975 with the intention of broadcasting to the student halls of residence from a studio under Southside. Broadcasting actually commenced in late 1976 on 999 AM although IC Radio has since stopped broadcasting over this frequency. Imperial College Radio pioneered a new system of broadcast, known as Leaky feeder and was the first station to be licensed by the Home Office for the use of this technique. For a short period in 1989, IC Radio broadcast on FM under a Test and Development license, but this way never expanded into a full FM license. In 2001 it moved to its current location, in the West Basement of Beit Quad over the internet www.icradio.com and, since 2004, on 1134 AM in Wye.

The two studios were linked via audio cables which ran through the College's system of service tunnels, enabling communications, and
