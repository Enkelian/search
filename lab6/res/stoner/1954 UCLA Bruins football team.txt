They played their home games at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and were coached by Henry Russell Sanders. It was Sanders' sixth season as the UCLA head coach. The Bruins finished 9–0 overall, and were Pacific Coast Conference Champions with a 6–0 record. The Bruins compiled 367 points against their opponents in nine games, and allowed only 40 points. The Bruins were not eligible to play in the Rose Bowl vs. Ohio State because of the "no repeat" rule in effect at the time. No team was allowed to participate in consecutive Rose Bowl games, and since UCLA had played in the 1954 Rose Bowl, they were excluded from the 1955 event. The game likely would have made for a de facto national championship game, but thus, rival USC (whom the Bruins soundly defeated 34-0 during the season) competed in the Rose Bowl instead, losing to Ohio State. Following the outcome, UCLA and Ohio State split the national championship. UCLA was selected national champion by NCAA-designated major selectors of Dunkel, FW, Litkenhous, National Championship Foundation, and UPI/coaches, and co-champion by
