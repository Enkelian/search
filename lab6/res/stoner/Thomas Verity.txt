Other London theatres for which he was engaged included the Royalty Theatre, the Novelty Theatre, the Folly Theatre, the Scala Theatre, and the Comedy Theatre. In 1878, he was appointed consulting architect to the Lord Chamberlain's office. Initially, this was in partnership with G. H. Hunt, but later with his son, Frank Verity, who received his training in his father's firm.Both Veritys bought an interest in ornate Second Empire-style architecture to their early buildings, developing this into grand Beaux Arts in their later works.
