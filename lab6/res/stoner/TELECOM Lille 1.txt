From the beginning, the school was built around a dual education system, in which professional internships are part of the school curriculum. This is still an essential aspect of the school training today. In the years 2000, a new apprenticeship curriculum was created for students willing to spend half of their time in a company and the other half at school. The school has also developed a strong expertise in e-learning. The TuttelVisio and TuttelNet platforms have trained dozens of engineers every year since 2000. In 2001, in order to reflect its membership to the world of Telecommunication and Information science, the school adopted the transitional name ENIC TELECOM Lille eventually
