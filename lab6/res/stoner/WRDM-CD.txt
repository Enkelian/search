WRDM-CD
WRDM-CD, virtual channel 19 (UHF digital channel 31), is a Class A Telemundo owned-and-operated television station licensed to Hartford, Connecticut, United States. Owned by the Telemundo Station Group subsidiary of NBCUniversal (itself a subsidiary of Comcast), it is sister to New Britain-licensed NBC owned-and-operated station WVIT (channel 30). The two stations share studios on New Britain Avenue in West Hartford and transmitter facilities on Rattlesnake Mountain in Farmington, Connecticut. Despite WRDM-CD legally holding a low-power Class A license, it transmits using WVIT's full-power spectrum. This ensures complete reception across the Hartfordâ€“New Haven television market. WRDM is available on Comcast Xfinity channel 13, Cox channel 20 and MetroCast Cablevision channel 18, but currently not on any satellite providers (though this will likely change in the near future, as carriage of WRDM will likely be compulsory to carry WVIT under retransmission consent rules). WDMR-LD (virtual channel 14, UHF digital channel 23) in Springfield, Massachusetts, operates as a translator of WRDM, serving the Pioneer Valley. This station's transmitter is located on Provin Mountain in the Feeding Hills section of Agawam, Massachusetts.
