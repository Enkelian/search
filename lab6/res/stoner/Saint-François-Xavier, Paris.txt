Saint-François-Xavier, Paris
St Francis Xavier's Church (French: Église Saint-François-Xavier or French: Église Saint-François-Xavier-des-Missions-étrangères in its long name form) is a Roman Catholic church and parish in the 7th arrondissement of Paris dedicated to Francis Xavier. It gives its name to the nearby Metro station Saint-François-Xavier. History A séminaire destiné à former des missionnaires à l’apostolat en pays lointains (seminary for foreign missions) had been set up on rue du Bac in 1637 by Monseigneur Duval, with an accord from pope Urban VIII, during the Counter Reformation. The seminary's oratory or chapel was built between 1683 and 1689, with interior decoration by Jacques Stella, Nicolas Poussin and Simon Vouet, and it was this chapel that operated secretly as a parish church for the area during the Revolutionary era when the area's actual parish church of Saint-Sulpice was shut down. In 1801 the chapel was attached to the church of Saint-Thomas-d’Aquin, which became the church for the Faubourg Saint-Germain, and the Missions étrangères parish was officially recognised and split from the parish of Saint-Sulpice in 1802, at which time its curé was abbé Dessaubaz. 40 years later, in 1842, the parish was dedicated to St Francis Xavier. However, the chapel soon became too cramped
