Awad al-Bandar
Awad Hamad al-Bandar (Arabic: عواد حمد بندر السعدون‎; aka: Awad Hamad Bandar Alsa'doon) (2 January 1945 – 15 January 2007) was an Iraqi chief judge under Saddam Hussein's presidency. He was a member of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party and was the head of the Revolutionary Court which issued death sentences against 143 Dujail residents, in the aftermath of the failed assassination attempt on the president on 8 July 1982. Arrest and trial After the US invasion, he was formally handed over to the interim Iraqi Government in 2004. On 31 July 2005, at the Al-Dujail trial, the Iraqi Special Tribunal tried al-Bandar for crimes against humanity for issuing the death sentences where he pleaded not guilty. On 5 November 2006, al-Bandar was sentenced to death by hanging along with co-defendants Hussein and Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti. His body was buried next to Saddam Hussein in Al-Awja. Al-Bandar's defence counsel consisted of Bader Awad Hamed Alsa'doon as lead defense and Saadoun Sughaiyer al-Janabi (also: Sa'doon al-Janabi). The latter was assassinated on 20 October 2005 one day after being abducted from his home in Baghdad. Execution The sentence was widely expected to be carried out on 30 December 2006, shortly before 6:00
