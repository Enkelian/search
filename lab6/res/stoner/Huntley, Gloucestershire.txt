Huntley, Gloucestershire
Huntley, Gloucestershire, is a village on the A40 located seven miles (11 km) west of Gloucester. It is in the north of the Forest of Dean. History Huntley (meaning Huntsman's clearing) is mentioned in the Domesday Book as Huntelei. The village was the scene of fighting during the English civil war. In 1643 the Royalists took the parliamentary garrison, but they were betrayed and in 1644 the parliamentarians regained control. The roads to Mitcheldean (now the A4136) and Ross-on-Wye were turnpiked in 1726 and the Toll house, which was built c1830 stood at their junction. This Toll house, that operated where the Longhope Road joins the Ross Road, was of sufficient importance to be replaced by a new one in 1881 and the house still stands. William Cobbett wrote that, during one of his Rural Rides through England in September 1826, he wanted to spend the night in Gloucester, but arrived there at the time of the Three Choirs Festival. As rooms were so expensive, he had to continue to the coaching inn at Huntley. The common, part of which is now the recreation ground and allotments, was enclosed in 1857 and in 1872 most of the remaining common land
