Plot As described in a film magazine, Barry Gordon (Rawlinson) and his brother Tom (Baxter) are both in love with Muriel Bekkman (Daw). Barry is a waster, however, and because he believes Muriel loves Tom the best, he takes to drinking heavily. He goes to Paris thinking that Tom and Muriel will get married, but then receives word that his brother has been lost in Morocco. He goes to the nearest African village there and learns that his brother is being held by natives. He agrees to exchange places with Tom and pay the natives handsomely. Muriel and her father Nathanial Beekman (Hall) arrive and are overjoyed when Tom returns, but they are also anxious about Barry. Tom, however, is content to wait in the village instead of searching for his brother. Finally Barry, having escaped from a cave, staggers into the village and Muriel, recognizing in him the better man, declares her love for him.
