Neuromedin B
Neuromedin B (NMB) is a bombesin-related peptide in mammals. It was originally purified from pig spinal cord, and later shown to be present in human central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. Sequence The sequence of the C-terminal decapeptide is highly conserved across mammalian species: GNLWATGHFM-(NH2); this decapeptide is sometimes noted as neuromedin B, but it is more accurately described as neuromedin B 23-32. The sequence of neuromedin B (in rat) is : TPFSWDLPEPRSRASKIRVHPRGNLWATGHFM-(NH2). Function Neuromedin regulates the following functions: exocrine and endocrine secretions cell growth body temperature blood pressure and glucose level Neuromedin signaling pathway NMB acts by binding to its high affinity cell surface receptor, neuromedin B receptor (NMBR). This receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor with seven transmembrane spanning regions, hence the receptor is also denoted as a 7-transmembrane receptor (7-TMR). Upon binding several intracellular signaling pathways are triggered (see Figure 2). When NMB binds to its 7-TMR, the heterotrimeric G protein that is attached to the receptor is activated. The G-protein is called heterotrimeric because it consists of 3 polypeptides: α subunit, β subunit, and γ subunit. In the activated NMBR/G-protein complex, there occurs an exchange of GTP for GDP bound to G-α subunit. The G-α subunit,
