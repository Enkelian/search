Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center
Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center, formerly known as Wilford Hall Medical Center, is a U.S. Air Force medical treatment facility located on the grounds of San Antonio's Lackland Air Force Base. Operated by the 59th Medical Wing, Wilford Hall is the Defense Department's largest outpatient ambulatory surgical center, providing the full spectrum of primary care, specialty care, and outpatient surgery. The medical facility is named after former Air Force physician, Maj. Gen. Wilford F. Hall, a visionary pioneer whose contributions were instrumental in the development of aeromedical evacuation. On Sept. 15, 2011, Wilford Hall Medical Center was renamed Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center as part of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission actions.
