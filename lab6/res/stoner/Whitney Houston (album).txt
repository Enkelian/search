Whitney Houston (album)
Whitney Houston is the self-titled debut studio album by American singer Whitney Houston. It was released on February 14, 1985, by Arista Records. The album initially had a slow commercial response, but began getting more popular in the summer of 1985. It eventually topped the Billboard 200 for 14 weeks in 1986, generating three number-one singles—"Saving All My Love for You", "How Will I Know" and "Greatest Love of All" (a cover of "The Greatest Love of All", originally recorded in 1977 by George Benson)—on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, which made it both the first debut album and the first album by a solo female artist to produce three number-one singles. The album topped the albums charts in many countries, including Canada, Australia, Norway and Sweden, peaking at number 2 in the United Kingdom, Germany, and Switzerland. The album was certified diamond for shipments of 10 million units or more on March 16, 1999, and later 13× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America on July 29, 1999. With sales of over 25 million copies, Whitney Houston is one of the best selling albums worldwide as well as one of the best selling debut albums of all time.In
