Triptykon
Triptykon is a Swiss extreme metal band from ZÃ¼rich, formed in 2008 by Thomas Gabriel Fischer, founding member of the pioneering heavy metal bands Hellhammer, Celtic Frost and Apollyon Sun. History Fischer announced his departure from Celtic Frost in May 2008 and shortly afterwards revealed his new project would be entitled Triptykon. The name of the band is the Greek word for "triptych", and is aimed at stating that Triptykon is founding member Thomas Gabriel Fischer's third project after Hellhammer and Celtic Frost. The band logo is inspired by a writing pattern used in Weimar Republic. Triptykon will sound as close to Celtic Frost as is humanly possible, and the album I am working on will feature all the material I envisioned for the successor to Celtic Frost's Monotheist. I desire the album to be a darker, heavier and slightly more experimental development of Monotheist. The first audio sample, for the song "Crucifixus", can be heard on the band's official Myspace page, among others. On August 5, 2009, Triptykon issued a press release indicating the recording of their debut album, Eparistera Daimones, would commence in the middle of August and continue through November, with a release in the spring of
