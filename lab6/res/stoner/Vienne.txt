Vienne
Vienne (French pronunciation: [vjɛn] (listen)) is a department in the French region of Nouvelle-Aquitaine. It takes its name from the river Vienne. History Established on March 4, 1790 during the French Revolution, Vienne is one of the original 83 departments. It was created from parts of the former provinces of Poitou, Touraine, and Berry, the latter being a part of the Duchy of Aquitaine until the 15th century. The original Acadians, who settled in and around what is now Nova Scotia, left Vienne for North America after 1604. Kennedy (2014) argues that the emigrants carried to Canada their customs and social structure. They were frontier peoples, who dispersed their settlements based on kinship. They optimized use of farmland and emphasized trading for a profit. They were hierarchical and politically active. Politics Édith Cresson, France's first woman Prime Minister from 1991-1992, was a deputy (MP) for the department. It has three arrondissements : Poitiers, the prefecture, and the subprefectures Châtellerault and Montmorillon.
