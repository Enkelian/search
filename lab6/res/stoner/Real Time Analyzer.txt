Real Time Analyzer
A real-time analyzer (RTA) is a professional audio device that measures and displays the frequency spectrum of an audio signal; a spectrum analyzer that works in real time. An RTA can range from a small PDA-sized device to a rack-mounted hardware unit to software running on a laptop. It works by measuring and displaying sound input, often from an integrated microphone or with a signal from a PA system. Basic RTAs show three measurements per octave at 3 or 6 dB increments; sophisticated software solutions can show 24 or more measurements per octave as well as 0.1 dB resolution. Types There are generally two types of RTAs: RTAs employing analog signal processing, and RTAs employing digital signal processing (DSP).The main difference between the two types is that the analog RTAs use a series of hardwired, analog bandpass filters to break the signal into frequency bands prior to measuring it. Digital RTAs use digital sampling technology and microprocessor based digital signal processing to perform necessary calculations, such as Fast Fourier Transforms, to perform the measurements and thus do not need analog hardware filters to isolate each frequency band. The digital approach to signal analysis generally yields much higher accuracy and resolution
