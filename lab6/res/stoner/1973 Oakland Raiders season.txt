1973 Oakland Raiders season
The 1973 Oakland Raiders season was the team's 14th season, and fourth in the National Football League. In Week Two of the regular season, the Raiders defeated the Miami Dolphins, snapping Miami's 18-game winning-streak including a perfect season in 1972. For the third time in four seasons, the Raiders won the AFC West title. They exacted a measure of revenge by defeating the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC Division Round game, one year following the Immaculate Reception loss. But the Raiders failed to reach the Super Bowl as they lost to Miami in the AFC Championship Game.
