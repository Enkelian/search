Celebration – Forty Years of Rock
Celebration – Forty Years of Rock is a greatest hits album by British rock band Uriah Heep. It mainly features rerecorded classics – which, said bassist Trevor Bolder, "chose themselves, really. The likes of 'Sunrise', 'Gypsy' and 'Look at Yourself' are songs we still play today. We just went in and redid them. [Drummer] Russell [Gilbrook] is a bit of an animal, so they sound livelier than ever." Two tracks were written specifically for this release: 'Only Human' ("A bit of an '80s vibe," said Bolder) and 'Corridors of Madness'. A double special edition, in digipak format, features a live DVD recorded at the Sweden Rock Festival. A collector's edition adds a vinyl single; its two songs also recorded at the Sweden Rock Festival, and not included on the DVD. Celebration was released in most European territories on 6 October 2009; on 26 October 2009 in the UK; and approximately one month later in the United States. In 2015, keyboardist Phil Lanzon released a music video for "Corridors of Madness", featuring footage filmed on tour in Israel and the United States.
