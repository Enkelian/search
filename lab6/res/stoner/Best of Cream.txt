Best of Cream
Best of Cream is a compilation album of material recorded from 1966 to 1968 by the rock band Cream, and released shortly after their disbanding. The album was originally released by Cream's U.S. label Atco (Atlantic) Records (catalog no. SD 33-291), and was available on that label during the years 1969â€“72. The album was briefly reissued in the U.S. in 1977 by RSO/Polydor Records, to whom U.S. distribution rights for Cream's recordings had reverted by that time. A re-release was pressed in 2014 by Polydor on 180g vinyl (catalog no. 535 113-8). Best of Cream was noteworthy upon its release as the first American album to contain Cream's studio recording of "Spoonful". Although included in international versions of Cream's 1966 debut album Fresh Cream, the song was deleted from Atco's initial U.S. release of the album, and replaced with the band's first hit single "I Feel Free". U.S. reissues of Fresh Cream contain both songs. The album peaked at No. 3 on the U.S. Billboard 200 album chart in July 1969. The album reached No. 6 on the UK album charts. The album was certified Gold by the RIAA. Track listing Side 1 "Sunshine of Your Love" (Jack Bruce, Pete
