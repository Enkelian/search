Hot Animation
HOT Animation was a British stop motion animation, 2D cel animation & computer animation studio, established on 1 April 1998 by Jackie Cockle, Brian Little, and Joe Dembinski. Their worldwide success followed with Bob the Builder, a show for pre-school children about a builder and his talking machines. In 2000, the theme tune was released as a single, Can We Fix It? with an accompanying promo produced at HOT, which beat Kylie Minogue's "Please Stay", Eminem's Stan and Westlife's "What Makes a Man" to become the Christmas number-one single. The company then made a reboot of Brambly Hedge, a series of 30-minute specials based on the illustrated books for children by Jill Barklem, and Rubbadubbers, a series about bath toys that come alive. Pingu, a Swiss series about a family of penguins, was recreated with great success in 2003. The company also provided CGI effects for seasons 8-12 of Thomas & Friends. HOT ceased to produce the main series of Bob the Builder after 2007 when the studio announced jobs would be cut, and opted to produce a direct to DVD series called Bob the Builder: On Site, using stop-motion from Bob's World and live action from real world construction
