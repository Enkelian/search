The CW Plus
The CW Plus is the national feed of The CW, owned by The CW Network, LLC (a joint venture between WarnerMedia and the CBS Entertainment Group unit of ViacomCBS, which each maintain a 50% ownership interest), that is primarily carried on digital subchannels and multichannel subscription television providers. The service is intended for areas ranked below the top 99 television markets in the United States designated by Nielsen Media Research. In addition to carrying CW network programming Monday through Friday and Sunday in daytime and prime time, as well as its Saturday morning educational programming block, The CW Plus runs a mix of syndicated and brokered programs. The CW handles programming and promotional services for The CW Plus at its corporate headquarters in Burbank, California (marketing services were handled through a separate division for the service until March 2008, when these operations were transferred to The CW's marketing department due to layoffs imposed by the network); centralcasting operations for the CW Plus affiliates are hubbed at the California Video Center in Los Angeles. Background One of the predecessors of The CW, The WB Television Network had maintained a similar group of subscription-only affiliate stations in small- and select medium-sized markets
