Ibanez JS Series
The Ibanez JS Series is a signature series of guitars endorsed by Joe Satriani and manufactured by Ibanez guitars. It is essentially the discontinued Radius Ibanez series, with Satriani's select pickups installed. The JS100 is a lower end model in comparison to the JS1000 and the JS1200. The JS1000 and JS1200 feature necks that are digitally reproduced from one of Joe Satriani's guitars. The JS1600 was introduced at NAMM 2008.
