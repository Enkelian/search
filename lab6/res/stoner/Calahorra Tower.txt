Calahorra Tower
The Calahorra tower (Spanish: Torre de la Calahorra) is a fortified gate in the historic centre of CÃ³rdoba, Spain. The edifice is of Islamic origin. History It was first erected by the Almohad Caliphate to protect the nearby Roman Bridge on the Guadalquivir. The tower, standing on the left bank of the river, originally consisted of an arched gate between two. A third tower was added to the existing ones, in the shape of two cylinder connecting them. The tower was declared a national historical monument in 1931. The restoration of the tower, along with the Roman Bridge, Gate of the Bridge and surrounding area, was awarded the European Union Prize for Cultural Heritage / Europa Nostra Award in 2014. == References ==
