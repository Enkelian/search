Glade of the Armistice
The Glade of the Armistice (French: Clairière de l'Armistice) is a French national and war memorial in the Forest of Compiègne in Picardy, France, near the city of Compiègne and approximately 60 kilometres (37 mi) north of Paris. It was built at the location where the Germans signed the Armistice of 11 November 1918 that ended World War I. During World War II, Adolf Hitler chose the same spot for the French and Germans to sign the Armistice of 22 June 1940 after Germany won the Battle of France. The site was destroyed by the Germans but rebuilt after the war. Today, the Glade of the Armistice contains a statue of World War I French military leader and Allied supreme commander Marshal Ferdinand Foch, and the reconstructed Alsace-Lorraine Memorial, depicting a German Eagle impaled by a sword. History The Armistice of 11 November 1918 was signed in one of the rail carriages ("Le Wagon de l'Armistice") of Foch's private train in Rethondes. The carriage was Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits (CIWL) No. 2419D. Foch had convened the armistice talks deep in the forest beside the small village of Rethondes, because he wanted to shield the meeting from intrusive journalists, as well
