2010 Oakland Raiders season
The 2010 Oakland Raiders season was the team's 41st season in the National Football League and their 51st overall. It also marked the last full season under the ownership of Al Davis, who died in October 2011. The Raiders had improved from a five-win season, their first since 2002, and achieved their first non-losing season since losing Super Bowl XXXVII on January 26, 2003. However, the team missed the playoffs for the eighth consecutive season. The Raiders picked 8th in the 2010 NFL Draft. There were no blacked-out home games after the early part of the season and the team won all six of their division matches, including a franchise-record 59 points in Denver. The Raiders became the first team in NFL history to go undefeated in their division and still not make the playoffs. The season was notable not only because the Raiders swept their division, but every victory came against a rival. The Raiders recorded home victories against the Seahawks, their former division foes from 1977 to 2001, and the Rams, whom the Raiders used to have a rivalry with during their time in Los Angeles from 1982 to 1994.
