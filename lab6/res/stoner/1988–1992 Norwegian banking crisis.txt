1988–1992 Norwegian banking crisis
The 1988–1992 Norwegian banking crisis was the largest financial crisis that occurred in Europe since the end of World War II within Norway. Background After major financial deregulation removing caps on lending rates, Norwegian banks began engaging in more risky credit operations and also resulted in a bank lending boom. This was followed by lower household investments. Bankers had no experience with competitive credit markets and requirements for on-site inspections were relaxed. In 1985 oil prices dropped significantly causing a Norwegian deficit and devaluation of the Krone. As public and private institutions began to consolidate their books, a recession began. 1988-1990 At first smaller banks began to fail. Credit began to freeze between banks as the lending rate began to rise. There was a shortage of capital and several banks were in danger of closing. Due to sound efforts, most were saved through mergers with solvent banks. The Norwegian exchange rate had recovered credibility towards the end of the period and it was hoped the recession was over. 1991-1992 Systemic Crisis Despite the return to credible exchange rates, with the reunification of Germany, the turbulence in the foreign exchange market caused Norwegian interest rates to rise even greater than before.
