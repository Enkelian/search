Chinese National Geography
Chinese National Geography (Chinese: 《中国国家地理》; pinyin: Zhōngguó Guójiā Dìlǐ) is a Chinese monthly magazine similar to the National Geographic Magazine. Founded in 1949 in China, the magazine has revamped itself several times, and is now a popular magazine in mainland China. There is also an edition in traditional Chinese for readers in Hong Kong and Taiwan. History Founded by a group of teachers with a keen interest in geography in 1949, the original Chinese edition was first published in January 1950 under the name Dili Zhishi (Knowledge of Geography; Chinese: 《地理知识》). The magazine focused on delivering scientific and geographical concepts. At first only 600 copies were printed, but the publication quickly became popular, and soon 2,000 copies of each volume were being printed. From August–December 1960, Dili Zhishi temporarily stopped publication. It reformed itself and resumed publication in January 1961 under a new name, Dili (Geography; Chinese: 《地理》). However, this new version was not successful with its readers, and the title was changed back to Dili Zhishi in 1966. However, the magazine was forced to stop publication with the Cultural Revolution in China. Six years later in 1972, the magazine was able to resume publication, and its circulation reached 400,000.
