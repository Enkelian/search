Lee Walls
Raymond Lee Walls Jr. (January 6, 1933 – October 11, 1993) was an American professional baseball player, an outfielder who appeared in Major League Baseball (MLB) between 1952 and 1964 as a member of the Pittsburgh Pirates, Chicago Cubs, Cincinnati Reds, Philadelphia Phillies and Los Angeles Dodgers. He also played the 1965 season in Japan, for the Hankyu Braves. The native of San Diego threw and batted right-handed, stood 6 feet 3 inches (1.91 m) tall, and weighed 205 pounds (93 kg). Walls wore eyeglasses on the field during his active career — a rarity for players of his era — and was nicknamed "Captain Midnight" because of his eyewear. Playing career Walls graduated from Pasadena High School and attended Pasadena City College. He signed with the Pirates in 1951. In 1956, his first full MLB season, Walls batted .274 with 11 triples (third in the National League), 11 home runs and 54 RBIs. On July 2, 1957, Walls—by this time a member of the Cubs—hit for the cycle in an 8–6 loss to Cincinnati at Wrigley Field. It was the highlight of a poor sophomore season for Walls, with his batting average dropping to .237 in 125 games played.
