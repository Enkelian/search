Rogers Arena
Rogers Arena is a multi-purpose arena located at 800 Griffiths Way in the downtown area of Vancouver, British Columbia. Opened in 1995, the arena was known as General Motors Place (GM Place) from its opening until July 6, 2010, when General Motors Canada ended its naming rights sponsorship and a new agreement for those rights was reached with Rogers Communications.

It is home to the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League and the Vancouver Warriors of the National Lacrosse League. The arena also hosted the ice hockey events at the 2010 Winter Olympics.

The Grizzlies spent six seasons in Vancouver before relocating to Memphis, Tennessee, for the 2001â€“02 season.
