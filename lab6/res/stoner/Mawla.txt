Mawla
Mawlā (Arabic: مَوْلَى‎, plural mawālī (مَوَالِي)), is a polysemous Arabic word, whose meaning varied in different periods and contexts.In the days before Muhammad, the term originally applied to any form of tribal association.In the Quran and hadiths it is used in a number of senses, including 'Lord', 'guardian', 'trustee', and 'helper'.After Muhammad's death, this institution was adapted by the Umayyad dynasty to incorporate new converts to Islam into Arab-Muslim society and the word mawali gained currency as an appellation for converted non-Arab Muslims in the early Islamic caliphates. Etymology The word mawla is derived from the root w-l-y (Arabic: ولي‎), meaning "to be close to", "to be friends with", or "to have power over". Mawla can have reciprocal meanings, depending on whether it is used in the active or passive voice: "master" or "slave/freedman", "patron" or "client", "uncle" or "nephew", or simply friend. Originally, mawāli were clients of an Arab tribe, but with the advent of Islam, the term came to refer to non-Arab Muslims and other client allies of the Muslim community. History The term originated in the days before Muhammad to refer to a politically-active class of slaves and freedmen, but it gained prominence during the Umayyad Caliphate,
