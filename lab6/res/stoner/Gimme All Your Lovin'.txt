Gimme All Your Lovin'
"Gimme All Your Lovin'" is a song by ZZ Top from their 1983 album Eliminator. It was released as the album's first single in 1983. Initially unsuccessful in the UK upon its August 1983 release, in the wake of the band's American success (the single reached No. 37 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart), it was promptly re-released, and reached No. 10 on the UK Singles Chart. It ties with the band's 1992 cover of Elvis Presley's "Viva Las Vegas" as their highest-charting single in the UK. The song was produced by band manager Bill Ham, and recorded and mixed by Terry Manning. Music video Directed by Tim Newman, the video features ZZ Top playing at a gas station, along with actor/model Peter Tramm playing a young gas station mechanic, and introduces classic ZZ elements such as the red "ZZ Eliminator Car," the "ZZ Keychain" and the "Three ZZ Girls" as heroines. It is the first of a ZZ Top music video series. Tramm returned in their later music video for "Sharp Dressed Man".
