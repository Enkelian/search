Susto
Susto (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈsusto], Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈsuʃtu]) is a cultural illness primarily among Latin American cultures. It is described by Razzouk et al. as a condition of being frightened and "chronic somatic suffering stemming from emotional trauma or from witnessing traumatic experiences lived by others". Susto is classified as a culture-bound syndrome, a symptom that occurs and is recognized within an ethnic group. Symptoms Among the indigenous peoples of Latin America, in which this illness is most common, susto may be conceptualized as a case of spirit attack. Symptoms of susto are thought to include nervousness, anorexia, insomnia, listlessness, fever, depression, and diarrhea. Classification Susto may be a culturally dependent variation of the symptoms of panic attack, distinct from anxiety and depressive disorders.
