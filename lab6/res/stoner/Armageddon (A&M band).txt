Armageddon (A&M band)
Armageddon were an English hard rock band formed in 1974. Their self-titled debut, Armageddon, was recorded in England and released in the United States on A&M Records. The albums' original liner notes use the term "supergroup", as their personnel were drummer Bobby Caldwell (previously a member of Captain Beyond), singer Keith Relf (who had fronted the band Yardbirds and was a co-founder of Renaissance), guitarist Martin Pugh (from Steamhammer), and bassist Louis Cennamo (also formerly of Renaissance and Steamhammer). History Keith Relf had helped with post production of the final Steamhammer LP, Speech, in 1971/72. Steamhammer's dissolution took place the same year of the album's release, as they had undergone numerous personnel changes since their inception, not the least of which was the death of drummer Mick Bradley in February 1972. The remaining Steamhammer alumni, Pugh and Cennamo, shared a flat and were asked by Keith Relf to move to Los Angeles with him early in 1974 with a view of forming a new band. They set out to recruit a drummer and happened across Bobby Caldwell (who had also been suggested to the band by Aynsley Dunbar) at The Rainbow in Hollywood; they began rehearsing together in late 1974/early
