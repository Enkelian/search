Beavis and Butt-Head Do America
Beavis and Butt-Head Do America is a 1996 American comedy film based on the MTV animated television series Beavis and Butt-Head. Co-written and directed by series creator Mike Judge, the film stars the regular television cast of Judge with guest performances by Demi Moore, Bruce Willis, Robert Stack and Cloris Leachman. The film centers on Beavis and Butt-Head as they travel across the country in an attempt to score. Previous offers by MTV to create a film version of Beavis and Butt-Head were rejected by Judge, but he eventually accepted one in 1994. When the film went into production, Judge and the show's staff halted production on the series while Judge and Joe Stillman wrote the script. They conceived numerous plot ideas with Judge's being the one developed into a film. John Frizzell composed the film's score. Beavis and Butt-Head Do America was praised by critics and proved to be a major box office hit from its release on December 20, 1996 by Paramount Pictures, grossing $63.1 million in the United States, becoming the biggest December box office opening in history until it was beaten the following year by Scream 2 and subsequently one week later by Titanic.
