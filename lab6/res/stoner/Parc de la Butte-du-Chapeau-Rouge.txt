Parc de la Butte-du-Chapeau-Rouge
The Parc de la Butte-du-Chapeau-Rouge formerly known as the Square de la Butte-du-Chapeau-Rouge, is a public park in the 19th arrondissement of Paris, which was created in 1939. It is an example of 1930s modernist park design, and contains a fountain and works of sculpture from the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937) held at the Trocadéro. The park is located between the Boulevard d'Algérie, Boulevard Sérurier, and avenue Debidour. The nearest Metro station is Pré-Saint-Gervais. History The Parc was built on a wide strip of land around the edge of the city which had been set aside as a military zone in the 1840s. Some Paris architects and planners had called for transforming the entire zone around the city into a continuous park, but that plan was abandoned and only a small amount of the zone was dedicated to green space.The new park was designed by the architect Léon Azéma, a classically trained architect who had won the Prix de Rome in 1921, along with his colleagues Jacques Carlu and Louis-Hippolyte Boileau, who had all worked together on the hillside and fountains of Palais de Chaillot for the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques
