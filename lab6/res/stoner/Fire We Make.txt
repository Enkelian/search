Fire We Make
"Fire We Make" is a song by American recording artists Alicia Keys featuring Maxwell, taken from Keys' fifth studio album Girl on Fire (2012). It was written and produced by Keys along with Gary Clark, Jr. and Warren "Oak" Felder and Andrew "Pop" Wansel from production duo Pop & Oak. "Fire We Make" is a downbeat neo soul ballad with adult contemporary R&B influences, in which Keys and Maxwell adopt sensual falsetto vocals. The instrumental elements used on it include echoing electric guitar riffs and clapping synthesizers. In "Fire We Make", Keys and Maxwell, as the protagonists, confess their love and speak of the chemistry they have with each other which they compare to fire that is "getting hotter and hotter." "Fire We Make" was well received by contemporary music critics, who noted its similarity to songs by Prince; they also praised its steamy production and the vocal performance of both singers. Released as the album's third single in the United States in March 2013, it has since reached number 29 on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and number 1 on Adult R&B chart. Its music video was directed by Chris Robinson and shot in the French Quarter neighborhood New
