Korean court music
Korean court music refers to the music developed in the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910). Very little is known about the court music of earlier Korean kingdoms and dynasties. It was partly modeled on the court music of China, known as yayue. Korean court music also has similarities with the court music of Japan, known as gagaku. There are three kinds of Korean court music: aak, an imported form of Chinese ritual music; a pure Korean form called hyangak; and a combination of Chinese and Korean styles called dangak. There is also a genre of aristocratic chamber music called jeongak.
