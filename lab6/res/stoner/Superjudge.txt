Superjudge
Superjudge is the second full length album by Monster Magnet, released on April 6, 1993 (see 1993 in music). It is the first Monster Magnet album to feature lead guitarist Ed Mundell, who replaced founding member John McBain in 1992. Overview Superjudge was Monster Magnet's second official album (Tab being an EP) and also their debut for A&M Records. It was recorded and mixed by Steve Rosenthal at New York's "The Magic Shop" studio in October, 1992. All original material was composed by Dave Wyndorf. The album fared poorly commercially, largely due to its release coinciding with the advent of the grunge era, which ultimately resulted in a dramatic decline in the popularity of heavy metal in general. The album includes cover versions of Willie Dixon's "Evil" (using the arrangement by Cactus, from their 1971 album Restrictions), and Hawkwind's "Brainstorm" from their 1972 album, Doremi Fasol Latido. Music videos were made for the songs "Twin Earth" and "Face Down". Though a commercial disappointment in the months following its release in 1993, it has since become a very influential album within the stoner rock genre.
