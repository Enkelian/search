Conscription in Greece
Since 1914, Greece (or the Hellenic Republic) has mandatory military service (conscription) of 9 months in the Army and of 12 months in the Navy and the Air Force for men between the ages of 19 and 45. Citizens discharged from active service are normally placed in the Reserve and are subject to periodic recall of 1–10 days at irregular intervals. Duration Universal conscription was introduced in Greece during the military reforms of 1909, although various forms of selective draft had been in place earlier. In more recent years, conscription was associated with the state of general mobilisation declared on July 20, 1974 due to the Turkish invasion of Cyprus (the mobilisation was formally ended on December 18, 2002). The length of a tour has varied historically, between 12–36 months depending on various factors particular to the conscript, and the political situation. Although women are accepted into the Greek army on a voluntary basis, they are not required to enlist, as men are. Soldiers receive no health insurance, but they are provided medical support during their army service, including hospitalization costs. Since 2009, Greece has mandatory military service of 9 months for the Army and 12 months for the Navy
