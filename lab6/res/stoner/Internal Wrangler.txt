Internal Wrangler
Internal Wrangler is the debut studio album by British indie rock band Clinic. It was released on 1 May 2000 through Domino Records. Background The band signed to Domino Records following the release of several self-financed singles. The song "The Return of Evil Bill" is a follow up to the song "Evil Bill" that appeared on the Clinic compilation album, and remains a fan favorite in live shows. The band, particularly lead singer Ade Blackburn, are superstitious and chose not to include a song on the 13th track; instead a four-second silence is heard before the album's final song, "Goodnight Georgie". This is believed to be why the subsequent albums have been no more than 12 songs long until 2010's Bubblegum. The short interlude track "DJ Shangri-La" is an excerpt of Ludwig van Beethoven's "Moonlight" Piano Sonata No. 14 in C-sharp minor played on a highly overdriven organ, although here it is played in standard 4/4 time, while the original piano motif was in 3/4 time. The song "The Second Line" was used prominently in a Levi's Jeans television advertisement in late 2000, which then led to it being re-issued. It also features an interpolation of the song "Cavern" by
