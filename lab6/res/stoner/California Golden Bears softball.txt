California Golden Bears softball
The California Golden Bears softball team is the intercollegiate softball team of the University of California, Berkeley. The team plays its home games at Levine-Fricke Field, which is located in Strawberry Canyon near California Memorial Stadium. While the stadium was built fairly recently in 1995, it is not up to the standards of the NCAA, and therefore cannot host NCAA tournament games. California softball is one of the most consistently successful programs at the school with a current 26 year NCAA tournament streak and a national championship in 2002. The current head coach is Diane Ninemire, who began her tenure in 1988 and has the most wins of any coach in California athletics history. History The California Golden Bears softball team has been one of the most consistently successful programs at the University of California since its inaugural season in 1972. Through the program's first forty years (1972–2011), it has had a record of 1,445–705–3 which is a .672 win percentage. The Bears are consistently ranked in the top 25, have reached the postseason for 27 straight years, have reached the Women's College World Series 14 times (11 NCAA, 3 AIAW), and have won 1 Women's College World Series Championship
