Ramesh Govindan
Ramesh Govindan is an Indian-American professor of computer science. He is the Northrop Grumman Chair in Engineering and Professor of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at the University of Southern California. Early life Govindan obtained a Bachelor of Technology degree from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras and then received master's and Ph.D degrees from the University of California, Berkeley. He then became an associate professor at the University of Southern California, where he researches topology, IP forwarding, and wireless sensor networking. Career Govindan was later named the Northrop Grumman Chair in Engineering and Professor of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. He is a former editor-in-chief of the journal IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing. He is a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).In 2000, he along with Kannan Varadhan and Deborah Estrin analyzed a way to prevent oscillations in topologies. During the study he have discovered that an inter-domain routing protocol called hop-by-hop is responsible for the unconstrained route selection and therefore the route get oscillated. However, if "safe" mode is enabled, it can shorten route selection as well as the number of errors. A year later, he peered
