Jussi 69
Jussi Heikki Tapio Vuori (born 11 July 1972 in Helsinki), better known as Jussi 69, is the drummer for the Finnish rock band The 69 Eyes. He is best-known for his flamboyant playing style that has earned him the attention of fans and cameramen alike; his kit is set up low to allow for the maximum exposure of his on-stage antics. His drumming relies primarily on cymbal flourishes rather than pure drum fills to transition between sections of a song. He appeared in an episode of Viva La Bam and in the film Bam Margera Presents: Where the ♯$&% Is Santa?.
