To Heaven from Hell
To Heaven from Hell is an EP released by the heavy metal band Diamond Head. Although all the songs on this EP were initially released on Borrowed Time, this is a collection of Diamond Head's early demos from before their debut album Lightning to the Nations was released. This album gives an insight to how the band initially wished their songs to sound before MCA tried to commercialize Diamond Head. Many of the songs have a much more raw feel about to them compared with their initial appearance on Borrowed Time.
