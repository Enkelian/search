Cidariini
The Cidariini are the largest tribe of geometer moths in the subfamily Larentiinae (possibly a distinct family). The Cidariini include many of the species known as "carpets" or, ambiguously, "carpet moths" (most other "carpets" are in the Xanthorhoini), and are among the few geometer moths that have been subject to fairly comprehensive cladistic study of their phylogeny. The tribe was described by Philog√®ne Auguste Joseph Duponchel in 1845. Genera As several larentiine genera have not yet been assigned to a tribe, the genus list is still preliminary; for example the genus Almeria may well belong in the Cidariini.
