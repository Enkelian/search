PictureBox Films
PictureBox is a video on demand film service offering a selection of films for a monthly subscription. It launched in 2006 and is available as a separate subscription through several Digital TV service providers in selected countries such as United Kingdom, Russia, Romania and Central and Latin America (Mexico, Colombia and Brazil). PictureBox was the first only wholly owned SVOD (subscription video on demand service) operated by NBCUniversal. In September 2016, PictureBox announced a rebrand of the service, along with the relaunch of its website. The new website features include a dedicated page for each territory service provider, designed to help users find out more about the service. Other features include 'bonus content', such as a blog section, with content curated by leading film critics James King and Karen Krizanovich, behind-the-scenes footage, film clips and monthly highlights. Business model PictureBox differentiates itself from other subscription video on demand services by offering subscribers ‘hand-picked’ films and TV shows. Instead of featuring a huge number of titles, its ‘panel of film lovers’ shortlist a selection of content each month. Films that have played for the longest time are removed from the service and replaced with a selection of different on demand films.
