Gold(I) chloride
Gold(I) chloride is a compound of gold and chlorine with the chemical formula AuCl. Preparation Gold(I) chloride is prepared by thermal decomposition of gold(III) chloride. Reactions Although there is a region of stability at higher temperatures at the appropriate chlorine vapor pressures, the compound is metastable at ambient conditions. When heated with water, the compound disporpotionates to metallic gold and gold(III) chloride in an autoredox reaction: 3 AuCl → 2 Au + AuCl3Reaction with potassium bromide yields potassium auric bromide and potassium chloride with separation of metallic gold: 3 AuCl + 4 KBr → KAuBr4 + 2 Au + 3 KCl Safety Gold(I) chloride may irritate the skin and eyes, damage kidney function, and reduce white blood cell counts. == References ==
