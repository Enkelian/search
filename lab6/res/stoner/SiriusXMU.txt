Until February 9, 2010, it was on Direct TV channel 831. The XM DJs were replaced with Sirius DJs, and acquired its current name, even though the channel is still listed as X043-FM by Mediabase. Sirius XM describes the channel as "North America's Indie Rock Station" and primarily airs artists who are signed to independent labels. The channel frequently plays songs from an artist's full album instead of just the singles. The Wall Street Journal has described XMU as "XM's alternative-music channel."The station name implies a "college radio" theme ("XM University").
