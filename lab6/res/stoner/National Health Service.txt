National Health Service
The National Health Service (NHS) is the publicly-funded healthcare system of the United Kingdom. Since 1948 it has been funded out of general taxation. It is made up of four separate systems that serve each part of the UK: The National Health Service in England, NHS Scotland, NHS Wales, and Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland. They were established together in 1948 as one of the major social reforms following the Second World War. The founding principles were that services should be comprehensive, universal and free at the point of delivery. Each service provides a comprehensive range of health services, free at the point of use for people ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom, apart from dental treatment and optical care. In England, NHS patients have to pay prescription charges with a range of exemptions from these charges. Each of the UK's health service systems operates independently, and is politically accountable to the relevant government: the Scottish Government, Welsh Government, Northern Ireland Executive, and the UK Government, responsible for England's NHS. Since 2013 operational responsibility for the NHS in England has been passed to NHS England. NHS Wales was originally part of the same structure as that of England
