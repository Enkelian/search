Ahead Rings Out
Ahead Rings Out is the debut album by British blues-rock band Blodwyn Pig, released in 1969. The band had been formed in 1969 by Mick Abrahams, the former guitarist of Jethro Tull, and sales of Ahead Rings Out rivalled those of Jethro Tull’s next album, Stand Up, reaching No. 9 on the British album chart.The album contained a healthy mixture of various styles of progressive blues and “The Modern Alchemist” displayed the jazz influence and saxophone skills of Jack Lancaster.It was voted number 15 in the All-Time 50 Long Forgotten Gems from Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums. Background In liner notes for the 2001 re-issue of the album, songwriter and singer Mick Abrahams recalled: The producer was Andy Johns (little brother to Glyn Johns of Rolling Stones production fame). I think the tape operator was Robin Black, who later went on to produce Jethro Tull and other notable acts of the time. I recall that we were all quite chuffed with the end result of this, our first offering after my not too long ago departure from Jethro Tull. One of the first songs we laid down was ‘It’s Only Love’ and it was cool at the time
