FIA European Formula 3 Championship (established in 1975)
FIA European Formula 3 Championship was a former European Formula Three racing competition, organised by the FIA. The series started in 1966 as a one-race event for national teams, named the Formula 3 Nations European Cup. In 1975, with the introduction of a new regulation for 2000 cc cars, the series was expanded into a proper championship. It was cancelled in 1984, and it was replaced by the European Formula Three Cup the next year, returning to a one-event format. In 1987, the EFDA started a new pan-European championship, named F3 Euroseries, but it ran for a single season. A proper continental series, re-using the Formula 3 Euro Series name, started in 2003, from the merger of the German and French championships.
