Town Lake Gazebo
The Town Lake Gazebo (also known as the Women in Construction Gazebo or Fannie Davis Town Lake Gazebo) is a historic gazebo on the south shore of Lady Bird Lake in Austin, Texas, beside Auditorium Shores. Built in 1969 to beautify the south shore of Lady Bird Lake, the gazebo was paid for by the National Association of Women in Construction and features eclectic architecture. The structure was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2020. History In 1960 the completion of Longhorn Dam on the Colorado River created Lady Bird Lake (then known as Town Lake) on the south edge of downtown Austin, Texas. The next year the Austin City Council formed a Town Lake Study Committee to recommend plans for the development of public land on the shores of the new lake. In 1965 the Austin chapter of the National Association of Women in Construction approached the City with a proposal to contribute a civic structure to beautify the Town Lake shoreline. On November 9, 1965, City Council approved NAWIC's plan to build a public gazebo that would provide a scenic view of downtown Austin and of the lake from Auditorium Shores to the south.In January
