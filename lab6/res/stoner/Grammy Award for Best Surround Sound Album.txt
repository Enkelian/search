Grammy Award for Best Surround Sound Album
The Grammy Award for Best Immersive Audio Album (until 2018: Best Surround Sound Album) was first awarded in 2005, as the first category in a new "Surround Sound" field. This field currently holds the Best Immersive Audio Album award as its sole category. It is one of a few categories which are open to both classical and non-classical recordings, new or re-issued. To qualify for this category, the recording must be in surround quality (with a minimum of four channels). The recordings must be commercially available on either DVD-Audio, DVD-Video, Blu-ray, SACD, surround download or a streaming-only copy. The award goes to the engineer, mastering engineer (if any) and producer. These used to be called Surround Engineer, Surround Mastering Engineer and Surround Sound Producer, respectively, but from 2020 the descriptions are Immersive Audio Engineer, Immersive Audio Mastering Engineer and Immersive Audio Producer, respectively. Performing artists do not receive the award, except if they are also the surround (mastering) engineer or the surround sound producer. The category was renamed Best Immersive Audio Album for the 2019 Grammy season. According to NARAS, "driven by the technological side of music evolution, the Best Surround Sound Album category [was] renamed Best Immersive Audio Album.
