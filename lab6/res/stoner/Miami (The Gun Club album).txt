Miami (The Gun Club album)
Miami is the second studio album by punk blues group The Gun Club, released in 1982. It was released on Blondie guitarist Chris Stein's label, Animal Records. Stein also produced the album. Debbie Harry appears as a backing singer on various tracks on the album under the pseudonym "D.H. Laurence Jr." The album front cover photograph doesn't include Rob Ritter who had already left the band. Before leaving, Ritter first taught all the bass-lines to his ex-Bags bandmate Patricia Morrison.Billy Idol had met up with Pierce in an L.A. bar around the time of 'Miami' and later revealed his commercial hit "White Wedding" had been an attempt to emulate the Gun Club's "Mother of Earth" from the Miami album. The song was covered by alt-country band The Sadies on their 2001 album Tremendous Efforts and also by Swedish band bob hund, but with lyrics in Swedish, as “Mamma din jord” on their 2019 album “0-100”.
