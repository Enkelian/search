Big I
Big I is the name of the freeway interchange where Interstate 25 and Interstate 40 intersect northeast of downtown Albuquerque, New Mexico. Description The Big I is a complex stack interchange located in central Albuquerque, New Mexico. The interchange, reconstructed between 2000 and 2002, is the busiest in the state, handling an average of 300,000 vehicles per day as of 2000. The interchange accommodates traffic movements between I-25, I-40, and their associated frontage roads. Every December since 1995, the Albuquerque Metropolitan Arroyo Flood Control Authority installs a snowman made of tumbleweed in the right-of-way next to the interchange. History The Big I was originally built in the early 1960s with left exits designed to handle 60,000 vehicles per day. By the late 1990s, however, it could no longer handle Albuquerque's increasing traffic flows and needed to be replaced. Construction work on a new interchange began in June 2000 and lasted until May 2002.The reconstruction, which was budgeted to cost $221.8 million (equivalent to $329 million in 2020), was completed at a total cost $293 million, (equivalent to $416 million in 2020), and took 23 months to complete. The reconstruction was the largest public works project ever undertaken in New Mexico,
