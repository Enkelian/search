Tangerine Dream (Kaleidoscope album)
Tangerine Dream is Kaleidoscope's debut album released on Fontana Records on November 24, 1967. Though not as popular as the U.S. Kaleidoscope, this British band (Tangerine Dream also refers to the German band led by Edgar Froese) was also part of the psychedelic movement with moderate domestic success, and just enough international exposure to have this album recognized in the genre's catalogue and regarded as one of the best in the same. Now sought by collectors and highly acclaimed by critics and fans this album has been musically compared to Nirvana's The Story of Simon Simopath and Pink Floyd's The Piper at the Gates of Dawn. Peter Daltrey, lead singer of the band was asked about the lyrics and the music of the album, and he wrote the following statement in the album's sleeve notes: "The collective subject of our songs is simple, life and people. We have written our songs about you. Happy people, sad people, lovely people and a few confused people. We have written of the children, of the king and his queen, and we have also included a few words about ourselves, about our lives, about our loves and about our dreams". Track listing All songs
