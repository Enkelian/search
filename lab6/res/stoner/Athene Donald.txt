Athene Donald
Dame Athene Margaret Donald (n√©e Griffith; born 15 May 1953) is a British physicist. She is Professor of Experimental Physics at the University of Cambridge and Master of Churchill College, Cambridge. Early life and education Donald was born Athene Margaret Griffith in London to Walter Griffith and Annette Marian Tylor. She was educated at Camden School for Girls and Girton College, Cambridge. She graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Natural Science (Theoretical Physics) followed by a PhD in 1977 for research on electron microscopy of grain boundary embrittled systems. Research and career She worked at Cornell University as a postdoctoral associate, where she switched working on metals to polymers, before returning to Cambridge (Department of Materials Science) in 1981 and to the Cavendish Laboratory in 1983. She became Professor of Experimental Physics in 1998. Her major domain of study is soft matter physics, particularly its applications to living organisms and the relationship between structure and other properties.Her research has applied microscopy, and in particular Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy to the study of both synthetic and biological systems, notably protein aggregation.Further details of her research can be found in the citation for the Faraday Medal she was awarded by
