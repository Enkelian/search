MotorSport Vision Formula Three Cup
The MotorSport Vision Formula Three Cup is a national motor racing series that takes place primarily in the United Kingdom, with a small number of events in mainland Europe. It is a club racing series aimed towards amateur drivers and aspiring racers, and uses older generation single seater Formula Three cars to keep costs low. The F3 Cup has three classes covering cars built between 1981 and 2011. The series is organised by MotorSport Vision, and in 2015 it was the only Formula Three series in the United Kingdom. History MotorSport Vision Racing, which is the racing division of MotorSport Vision, announced the launch of the MSV F3 Cup in 2011. It is the successor to the BRSCC run championships/series with the names BRSCC F3, Club F3 and ARP F3. For 2012, the club obtained championship status and from then on became known as F3 Cup. Equipment Teams are allowed to use Formula Three chassis built after 1980 but before 2005. This allows teams to enter with cheaper equipment. The series uses a control tyre which all drivers must use. The tyres are supplied by Avon Tyres, whose parent company supply tyres to the British Formula 3 Championship. Engines will
