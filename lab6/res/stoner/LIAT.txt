LIAT
LIAT (1974) Ltd, formally known as Leeward Islands Air Transport or LIAT, is an airline headquartered in Antigua. It operates high-frequency inter-island scheduled services serving 15 destinations in the Caribbean. The airline's main base is V.C. Bird International Airport, Antigua and Barbuda, with a base at Grantley Adams International Airport, Barbados. History Leeward Islands Air Transport Services was founded by the late Kittician (now Sir) Frank Delisle in Montserrat on 20 October 1956 and began flying with a single Piper Apache operating between Antigua and Montserrat. With the acquisition in 1957 of 75 percent of the airline by the larger, better known BWIA, LIAT was able to expand to other Caribbean destinations and to obtain new aircraft types, such as the Beechcraft Bonanza and de Havilland Heron. Hawker Siddeley HS 748s came in 1965, due to the airline's decision to phase out the Herons. In 1968, LIAT was operating some flights via an agreement with Eastern Air Lines to provide passenger feed at this U.S. based air carrier's hub located in San Juan, Puerto Rico and was flying "Eastern Partner" service between San Juan and Antigua, St. Kitts and St. Maarten.LIAT was not always an all propeller aircraft airline.
