Plexifilm
Plexifilm is an independent DVD label and film production company co-founded by Gary Hustwit (formerly VP of Salon.com) and Sean Anderson (formerly Director of DVD Development of The Criterion Collection) in 2001. Plexifilm produces original films, releases films theatrically, and produces, distributes and markets DVDs. Controversy In late 2008, after the band Wilco heard of Plexifilm's interest in releasing a Blu-ray version of the Sam Jones documentary I Am Trying to Break Your Heart: A Film About Wilco, the band urged fans in emails and on television appearances to not buy the new version. Wilco's stance is that the cost does not substantiate any gained value for the money to their fans. Plexifilm responded on their website that the quality of the transfer to Blu-ray is beneficial. Meetings between the band and the DVD company are ongoing as of December 2008.
