2001 St. Louis Rams season
The 2001 St. Louis Rams season was the franchise's 65th season in the National Football League, the seventh season in St. Louis and the second under head coach Mike Martz. The Rams set a franchise record for wins in a season (14), while also going a perfect 8–0 on the road. Quarterback Kurt Warner would go on to win his second league MVP award. Along with Warner's 1999 MVP award and Marshall Faulk's 2000 award, the Rams had amassed the last three NFL MVP awards. The Rams also became the first team in NFL history to open three consecutive seasons with six straight wins and the first to score 500 or more points in three consecutive seasons. The Rams returned to the Super Bowl for a second time after shockingly winning their first title 2 years before, but this time against the 11–5 New England Patriots, led by Bill Belichick and sophomore quarterback Tom Brady. The Rams were expected by many to win their 2nd Super Bowl title, but lost 17–20 after Patriots placekicker Adam Vinatieri kicked the game-clinching field goal. This was the Rams' last Super Bowl appearance until the 2018 season, when they defeated the Saints 26–23 in
