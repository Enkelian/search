Society of United Irishmen
The Society of United Irishmen, founded as a Radical or liberal political organisation in 18th-century Belfast, Ireland, initially sought Parliamentary reform. It evolved into a revolutionary republican organisation, inspired by the American Revolution and allied with Revolutionary France. It launched the Irish Rebellion of 1798 with the objective of ending British monarchical rule over Ireland and founding a sovereign, independent Irish republic. Background During the 1780s, a few liberal members of the ruling Protestant Ascendancy, organised as the Irish Patriot Party led by Henry Grattan, campaigned for the following: reform of the Irish Parliament, a lessening of British interference in Ireland's affairs, and expanding the rights and voting franchise for Catholics and Presbyterians. Supporting them was the Irish Volunteers movement, which had widespread Protestant support. Whilst they had limited success such as the establishment of Grattan's Parliament and the repeal of some of the discriminatory Penal Laws, they fell short of many of their aims. When the parliamentary reform movement collapsed in 1784, it left radicals without a political cause.By the mid-1780s, radicalism in Ireland was taking a new, bolder form, typified by the letters penned by William Drennan, which were published in the Belfast Newsletter and in pamphlets.
