Shriners Auditorium is a 2,650-seat indoor arena located in Wilmington, Massachusetts. It was built in 1977 as the headquarters for the Aleppo Shriners, who had been based in Boston, Massachusetts since 1882. The Aleppo Shriners still own the auditorium today.

The facility features 37,000 square feet (3,400 m2) of exhibit space in the arena and 11,600 square feet (1,080 m2) of meeting space in three meeting rooms. Its main lobby features 3,300 square feet (310 m2) of space. It can seat up to 4,150 for boxing, wrestling, mixed martial arts and concerts, among other events.

Trade shows, sporting events, conventions, banquets and the Shrine Circus are also held at the facility. The building is handicapped accessible and has a 24-foot (7 m) ceiling height.
