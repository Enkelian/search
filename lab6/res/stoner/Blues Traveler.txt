Blues Traveler
Blues Traveler is an American rock band that formed in Princeton, New Jersey in 1987. The band's music spans a variety of genres, including blues rock, psychedelic rock, folk rock, soul, and Southern rock. They are known for extensive use of segues in live performances, and were considered a key part of the re-emerging jam band scene of the 1990s, spearheading the H.O.R.D.E. touring music festival.

Tad Kinchla and Ben Wilson joined the band following the death of original bassist Bobby Sheehan in 1999.

In the years following, the band has bounced around through a succession of independent labels and record producers,
