The population within the town limits was 631 at the 2010 U.S. Census, although Greater Upper Marlboro is many times larger.

The name change is linked to a postal clerk who felt that the last three letters, "ugh", did not properly fit on the rubber stamps being used at the time. By 1893, postal guides were referring to the town as Upper Marlboro and the name stuck, despite a proposed ballot to have it changed back in 1968.
