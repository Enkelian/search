It was mixed by Portner and Adam McDaniel at Drop of Sun Studios, in Asheville, NC. Composition "Saturdays (Again)" was noted as being somewhat similar to the sound of Eucalyptus in that it is acoustic, but "within a lush and dubby mix, atop melodic synth bass, [and] accompanied by peals of lead guitar", according to Spin. It was also considered "low-key" with few vocal effects. Track listing == References ==
