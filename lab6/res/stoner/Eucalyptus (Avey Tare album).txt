Eucalyptus (Avey Tare album)
Eucalyptus is the second solo studio album by American recording artist Avey Tare. It was released on July 21, 2017 as the follow-up to his 2010 solo debut Down There, Eucalyptus is his first solo release following the formation of his band Avey Tare's Slasher Flicks. It was recorded by fellow Animal Collective bandmate Joshua Dibb, and features past collaborators Eyvind Kang and Angel Deradoorian. Production A press release by Domino described the album as "an electroacoustic movement through leaves, rocks and dust. Written on sunlit bedroom afternoon in Los Angeles, practiced in the dark early hours of the California twilight, and slept on under Big Sur skies." Portner wrote the album by himself in 2014, but due to commitments with his band Animal Collective he set the material aside. In an interview with Stereogum, Portner elaborated on the writing of the album: ...my process would just be pretty much: pick up my acoustic guitar, sit on my bed, just spend part of the afternoon or a couple of hours playing guitar and singing with my recorder â€” I record everything that I play. I like to find a good balance between intuitive creativity and something that's very thought out.
