Southern Records
Southern Records is an independent record label closely associated with Crass Records, Corpus Christi Records and Dischord Records. It is based in London and had offices in Chicago (closed November 2008), Le Havre (closed July 2009), and Berlin (closed December 2008). History Southern was originally a recording studio owned and operated by John Loder. Loder became friends with musician, author and poet Penny Rimbaud and collaborated with him and others in an experimental progressive band called EXIT. Rimbaud later formed anarchist punk band Crass, and Southern Studios and John Loder were the obvious choice of venue for the recording of their first album The Feeding of the 5000, originally released on Small Wonder Records. When Small Wonder encountered problems manufacturing the release, due to the allegedly blasphemous nature of some of the lyrics, Crass determined they would need to start their own label to take full responsibility and control of their output. Loder facilitated this by acting as the business manager behind Crass Records: arranging manufacture, distribution and accounting.The success of Crass and their label thrust Loder into the emerging international independent record business, as he formed alliances with small distributors around the world to distribute the band's output.
