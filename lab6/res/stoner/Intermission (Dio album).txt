Intermission (Dio album)
Intermission is the first live album released by the American heavy metal band Dio in 1986 on the label Vertigo Records in Europe and Warner Bros. Records in North America. The live songs were recorded with guitarist Vivian Campbell during the first leg of the Sacred Heart tour. Craig Goldy replaced Campbell in mid-tour, and the band wanted something to represent the new line-up, so they recorded in studio the song "Time to Burn" with him, which was added to this album. The band had featured on many radio-broadcasts but fans who had been hoping for a double live album were somewhat disappointed with this release, especially as the guitar parts of the now-departed Campbell seem low in the mix. The original UK release came with a postcard-pack. In 2012, the album was included as bonus tracks on the deluxe edition of Sacred Heart Track listing Personnel DioRonnie James Dio - vocals Vivian Campbell - guitar solos Craig Goldy - guitar on "Time to Burn", over-dubbed rhythm guitar on the live tracks Jimmy Bain - bass Claude Schnell - keyboards Vinny Appice - drums Charts Album References External links Intermission at Black Sabbath Online
