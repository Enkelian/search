Melodic metalcore
Melodic metalcore is a fusion genre, incorporating elements of melodic death metal and metalcore, with a heavy emphasis on melodic instrumentation, distorted guitar tones, palm muting, double bass drumming, blast beats, metalcore-stylized breakdowns, aggressive screaming, death growls, and clean singing. The genre has seen commercial success for employing a more accessible sound at times compared to other forms of extreme music. Many notable melodic metalcore bands have been influenced by At the Gates and In Flames. History Origins Melodic metalcore began to take form in the late 1990s and early-2000s, tracing its roots to Swedish melodic death metal groups such as At the Gates and In Flames.

In contrast, melodic metalcore most often stemmed from American based metal bands who began incorporating metalcore elements, such as metallic breakdowns, into their music. Florida's Poison the Well are considered the first melodic metalcore band, proving extremely influential to subsequent bands thanks to their first two albums The Opposite of December and
