Candoxatril
Candoxatril is the orally active prodrug of candoxatrilat (UK-73967) human neutral endopeptidase (Neprilysin) as the neutral endopeptidase 24.11 complexed (RB-101) with phosphoramidon degrades and inactivates a number of bioactive peptides. Two multiply connected folding domains of the neutral endopeptidase locus splicing of exons 1, 2a, or 2b to the common exon 3 composed of 24 exons of the human CALLA/NEP gene containing the active site, it is known as peptidase family M13 (neprilysin family, clan MA(E)) the gluzincins a faint but significant structural relationship of the metzincins to the thermolysin-like enzymes, Zincin is the simplest descriptor of biological space. The structure reveals two multiply connected folding domains which embrace a large central cavity containing the active site of the 5-indanyl ester prodrug candoxatril and differs from phosphoramidon [N-(N-(((6-Deoxy-Î±-L-mannopyranosyl)oxy)hydroxyphosphinyl)-L- leucyl)-L-tryptophan] in several respects the structure of human neutral endopeptidase complexed with phosphoramidon is lost due to desolvation of the enzyme and ligand on formation of the complex Candoxatril. Studies Candoxatril is the first drug of its kind to be released for clinical trials regarding heart failure. This is because Candoxatril produces favorable haemodynamic effects in patients with chronic heart failure. It has been demonstrated that Candoxatril is associated with a beneficial
