Requinto guitar
A requinto guitar is a smaller version of a classical guitar, with a scale length between 52-54cm. It is tuned a fourth higher than a standard classical guitar, to A2-D3-G3-C4-E4-A4. They often, but not always, have a cutout to reach the higher frets. Classical use The requinto guitar is traditionally used in guitar orchestras, along with other sized guitars. Modern use The requinto guitar is now especially popular in Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America. In Mexico it is used in Trío romántico groups. It was first introduced in popular music in 1945 by Mexican guitarist/vocalist Alfredo Gil of romantic music trio "Los Panchos."Requintos made in Mexico have a deeper body than a standard classical guitar (110 millimetres (4.3 in) as opposed to 105 millimetres (4.1 in)). Requintos made in Spain tend to be of the same depth as the standard classical. See also Guitalele - A similar ukulele-guitar hybrid with the same tuning but a much smaller body. == References ==
