History The first Barbizon School of Modeling and Acting was opened in 1939 on Fifth Avenue in New York City, New York, by Helen Fraser, a fashion model and teacher with her husband, Dr. Fraser, a dentist. The Barbizon name was developed from the Fraser's vacations to France where they became interested in the town of Barbizon, a village outside of Paris known for the 19th-century Barbizon school of painters. She wrote a book Assignment in Modeling: A Guide to a Career in Fashion and Photographic Modeling". In 1950, Helen met Ronald Reagan, who would later become President of the United States, and awarded him with the Best-Dressed Man in America award she established.
