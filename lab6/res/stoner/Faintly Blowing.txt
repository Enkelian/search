Faintly Blowing
Faintly Blowing is Kaleidoscope's second studio album released by Fontana Records in April 1969. Though not as popular as the U.S. Kaleidoscope, this British band was also a band from the psychedelic movement with moderate domestic success, and just enough international exposure to have this album recognized in the genre's catalogue and regarded as one of the best in the same.
