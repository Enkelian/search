Occupy Unmasked
Occupy Unmasked is a 2012 American documentary film directed by Steve Bannon and produced by David Bossie, which is critical of the Occupy movement and was produced by Citizens United Productions. The documentary was released in limited theaters on September 21, 2012, distributed by Mark Cuban's Magnolia Pictures. Cuban stated "I don't have any politics" and that his company released the documentary solely "because we believe there is an audience for it" before the 2012 U.S. Presidential election. Synopsis The film takes a critical look at the Occupy movement. Andrew Breitbart and producer Stephen Bannon contend that the Occupy movement is sinister, violent, and organized with the purpose of destroying American capitalism and tarnishing the image of New York entrepreneurs. The film also discusses allegations of rape, drug use, and property destruction at the Occupy encampments. Premiere The Occupy Unmasked premiere was introduced by Minnesota Congresswoman Michele Bachmann in a tent theater outside of Tampa Bay Times Forum during the 2012 Republican National Convention. 250 people identified as Occupy Wall Street demonstrators attempted to buy tickets but were turned away by the event organizers.
