Space Lord
"Space Lord" is a 1998 single by the psychedelic rock band Monster Magnet, from the album Powertrip. It brought them mainstream success, with its accompanying music video directed by Joseph Kahn. The music video was a direct spoof of the music video for the single "Feel So Good" by rapper Mase. The song peaked at number three on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Songs chart, and number twenty-nine on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart. A remixed version of the song was also made, and was featured (along with the original) on their greatest hits album, Greatest Hits. The music video is notable for being the first video ever aired on MTV's Total Request Live on September 14, 1998. It appeared on the countdown five times climbing no higher than the #7 position.The line, "Space lord, motherfucker," was truncated and an echo added to make the song more radio- and TV-friendly (the lyric is heard as "Space lord, mother, mother"), but the vocal rhythm is unchanged, and a band version with the original lyric has never been released. The original lyric can be heard uncensored on the "Intergalactic 7 Remix" on international releases of the aforementioned Greatest Hits album and also on
