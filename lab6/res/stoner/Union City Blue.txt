Union City Blue
"Union City Blue" is a song by the US rock band Blondie. It was written by Debbie Harry and Nigel Harrison, and was featured on their fourth studio album Eat to the Beat from 1979. The tune was inspired by the 1979 movie Union City, which Debbie Harry appeared in (she wrote the lyrics one evening during a break in the shooting). Single information The song was released as the second single from the album in the United Kingdom, where it reached no. 13 in the UK Singles Chart in late 1979; it was never released as a single in the US. The video for the single, directed by David Mallet, was filmed at the Union Dry Dock, Weehawken, New Jersey. The track was re-released on CD and vinyl in 1995 as a maxi single in both the UK and US, featuring various remixes of the song by Diddy, Burger Queen, OPM and Jammin' Hot. A previously heavily bootlegged live version from 1979 of Donna Summer's hit "I Feel Love" was included as a b-side. Charting a second time after its original 1979 release, the single peaked at no. 31 in the UK. The remixed version of "Union City Blue"
