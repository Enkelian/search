Learnin' the Blues
"Learnin' the Blues" is a big band popular song written by Dolores "Vicki" Silvers. The song was originally recorded by Philadelphia singer Joe Valino; then, famously, by Frank Sinatra with Nelson Riddle & his Orchestra in 1955. Initially published on the B side of the EP Session With Sinatra (Capitol Records EAP 1-629), Learnin' the Blues was subsequently re-released in June 1955 as a single with Sinatra's If I Had Three Wishes on the B side (Capitol 3102). In the weeks of 3-9 and 24-30 July 1955, Sinatra's rendition was briefly the most frequently played song on U.S. radio. The single's sales peaked at #2 on the NME British charts in August 1955, and at #1 on the Australian charts for the week of 13â€“19 November 1955. In cumulative year-end charts for 1955, Learnin' the Blues ranked #14 (Billboard Year-End) in the United States and #17 (NME Year-End) in the United Kingdom. Sinatra re-recorded the song in 1962 for the album Sinatra-Basie. The song was covered by Cab Calloway 1955 (Bell 1096 USA).
