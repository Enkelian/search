Classic FM (UK)
Classic FM (stylised as Classic fM) is one of the United Kingdom's three Independent National Radio stations. The station broadcasts classical music. Classic FM was the first national classical music station to have been launched since the opening of BBC Radio 3, 25 years earlier, in September 1967, and 46 years since the opening of Radio 3's predecessor, The Third Programme, in September 1946. Overview Classic FM broadcasts nationally on FM, DAB digital radio, Freeview, satellite and cable television and is available internationally by streaming audio over the internet. In addition to playing older music, the station plays several modern film scores and video game music. However, Classic FM still claims to be "UK's only 100 percent classical music station".

It had been operating a trial programme on its AM frequencies in Wiltshire and Bristol, testing audience reaction to a regular drive-time programme of popular classical music. It proved successful and the company's CEO, Ralph Bernard, and programme director, Michael Bukht, drew up the plans for a national station.Meanwhile,
