Parallax (Atlas Sound album)
Parallax is the third studio album from Bradford Cox's solo project Atlas Sound, released November 7, 2011 on 4AD. The album debuted at #97 on the Billboard 200 and has received critical acclaim. Album title After Parallax was recorded, Bradford Cox was forced to continue touring with Deerhunter, which ended up being so stressful for Cox that it caused him to have a nervous breakdown. Cox related album's title to his lifestyle, saying: Recording Production duties were handled by Cox and previous Deerhunter producer Nicolas Vernhes. The album was assembled at the end of a Deerhunter tour and was mostly recorded at Nicholas Vernhes' studio, Rare Book Room Studios in Brooklyn, NY. Two of the album's tracks ("Flagstaff" and "Terra Incognita") were recorded by Cox himself in his hotel room at the Ace Hotel in New York as a result of limited studio time. 4AD also launched a website, depicting an image of Cox in Manhattan's Central Park, similar to the artwork of his two previous releases, his face is obscured by a lens flare. The website lists the genre as "Science Fiction." Cox dedicated the album to the late Trish Keenan of Broadcast, who had died earlier in 2011.The
