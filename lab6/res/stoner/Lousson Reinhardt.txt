Lousson Reinhardt
Henri Baumgartner (1929â€“1992), known professionally as Lousson Reinhardt, was a French gypsy jazz guitarist and the first son of Django Reinhardt by his first wife, Florine "Bella" Mayer. Biography Django Reinhardt married Florine "Bella" Mayer in 1927 according to gypsy custom although their marriage was not registered, and therefore not recognised under French law. Their son Henri, nicknamed "Lousson" from the French "l'ourson" meaning "bear cub", was born in 1929, however shortly after this the couple separated and Florine remarried; his birth certificate thus bears the last name Baumgartner from Mayer's second husband. Henri/Lousson learned to play guitar from his relatives; he is pictured playing with Django and others in a photograph dating from the mid 1940s and played rhythm guitar with Django's "Nouveau Quintette" on a tour of Belgium in November-December 1948, of which an official release exists. Lousson was frequently on the road in the 1950s and 1960s and never recorded commercially except for an unreleased 1960s studio recording from Paris with violinist Vivian Villerstein.A private and rather shy individual, Lousson performed in bars in Paris through the 1960s, most frequently accompanied by fellow guitarist Jean-Marie Pallen, and appeared several times at the Django Reinhardt memorial festivals Samois-sur-Seine.
