Blas de Lezo
Admiral Blas de Lezo y Olavarrieta (3 February 1689 â€“ 7 September 1741) was a Spanish navy officer best remembered for the Battle of Cartagena de Indias (1741) in modern-day Colombia, where Spanish imperial forces under his command decisively defeated a large British invasion fleet under Admiral Edward Vernon. Throughout his naval career, Lezo sustained many severe wounds; he lost his left eye, left hand, complete mobility of the right arm, and had his left leg amputated in situ after being hit by the projectile of a cannon. There is ample documented evidence in medical records of the wounds he sustained, and he was known as Captain Pegleg and Half-man. Lezo perceived his wounds and physical limitations as medals and refused to wear an eye patch to hide his blind eye. Displaying his past battles' history on his flesh won the respect of his peers and soldiers .Lezo's defense of Cartagena de Indias against an exponentially larger British fleet consolidated his legacy as one of the most heroic figures in the history of Spain. He is often recognized as one of the greatest strategists in naval history. Biography Early missions and injuries Born in Pasajes (by then still part of
