Force It
Force It is the fourth studio album by the British rock band UFO, released in 1975. It became their first album to chart in the United States. The album was produced by Ten Years After bass player Leo Lyons. Another Ten Years After member, Chick Churchill, played keyboards, the first use of that instrument on a UFO record. The CD reissue was remastered at Sound Recording Technology, Cambridge in 1994. Album cover The somewhat controversial original cover was designed by Hipgnosis, as were almost all other UFO albums of the 1970s. The nudity on the cover verged on breaching decency standards and the genders of the couple in the bathtub were not known for several years. The models were later revealed to be Genesis P-Orridge and their bandmate Cosey Fanni Tutti, both later of the influential industrial band Throbbing Gristle. The artwork was softened for the initial US release, making the couple in the bathtub transparent. The cover is a pun â€” there are multiple taps (British English) or "faucets" (US English) in the picture, which is a play on the album's title.
