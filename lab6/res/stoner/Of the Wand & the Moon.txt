Of the Wand & the Moon
Of the Wand & the Moon (stylized as :Of the Wand & the Moon:) is the neofolk/experimental project of Danish musician Kim Larsen and various guest contributors. Overview After irreconcilable differences with his previous musical project, Saturnus, Larsen began writing music of a different vein, similar in style to his neofolk influences. In 1999, the debut :Of the Wand & the Moon: album was released, titled Nighttime Nightrhymes. 2001 saw the release of a second :Of the Wand & the Moon: release titled :Emptiness:Emptiness:Emptiness:. After the release of a split album with Sol Invictus and a few vinyl singles, a collection of b-sides, taken from the :Emptiness:Emptiness:Emptiness: sessions, titled Lucifer, was released in 2003. A third album, Sonnenheim, was released in 2005. Here, the music bears a strong resemblance to that of neofolk pioneers Death in June. After a 6-year silence, a fourth album, The Lone Descent, was released in 2011. It features more contemporary influences and a richer production. The album was received with great critical acclaim and is considered a neofolk masterpiece.
