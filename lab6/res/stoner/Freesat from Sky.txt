Freesat from Sky
Freesat from Sky is a British satellite television service from Sky UK. It offers over 240 free-to-air (FTA) channels in its EPG. This is a greater number than its competitors, Freesat, which has 200+, and Freeview, which has 70+. It also has up to six HD channels and Sky Active interactive data service. The service is less-promoted than the subscription-based Sky satellite service. Service reach As of April 2011, the number of households with free-to-view satellite television is estimated by Ofcom to be 2.045 million, or 8.0% of households with television. (This figure includes households with BBC/ITV Freesat, Freesat from Sky, and 'churned' Sky subscribers who kept their Sky Digiboxes to access free-to-view channels.) Reception equipment This service requires use of the proprietary SkyHD or SD set-top box, to receive the FTA channels. Sky's boxes use the proprietary OpenTV EPG for interactive television services. The boxes are limited in some regards when compared to other satellite receivers, such as digital audio, video outputs, and the lack of the ability to use a dish motor and scan for channels not carried on the EPG. They also feature an EPG that contains all Sky channels, including pay-TV services which are not available
