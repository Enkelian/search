The Early Four Track Recordings
The Early Four Track Recordings is a compilation album by indie rock band Of Montreal. It contains early recordings from the band, with the song titles telling a fictional story about actor Dustin Hoffman. Though the titles feature Dustin Hoffman, the album name and content have nothing to do with him, and the titles were chosen only for humor. == Track listing ==
