Whiteleys
Whiteleys is a former department store located in Bayswater, London, which opened in 1889. It is now owned by Meyer Bergman and Warrior Capital. It was built in the retail space of the former William Whiteley Limited department store, which opened in 1911 as London's first department store, and was one of the main three department stores, alongside Liberty's and Harrods. The store's main entrance is located on Queensway. In December 2018, Whiteleys was closed for redevelopment. History Original store The original Whiteleys department store was created by William Whiteley, who started a drapery shop at 31 Westbourne Grove in 1863. By 1867 it had expanded to a row of shops containing 17 separate departments. Dressmaking was started in 1868, and a house agency and refreshment room, the first ventures outside drapery, opened in 1872. By then 622 people were employed on the premises and a further 1,000 outside. Whiteleys started selling food in 1875, and a building and decorating department was added in 1876. This proved to be particularly profitable, as the large stuccoed houses in the area needed regular repainting. Whiteleys met strong opposition from smaller tradesmen, and also from the local authorities over its grand building plans,
