Kidz Bop Radio
Kidz Bop is a brand of compilation albums featuring children singing and covering contemporary and clean pop songs, made more kid appropriate by changing from explicit lyrics. The series was developed by Razor & Tie co-founders Cliff Chenfeld and Craig Balsam on October 9, 2001. The albums are composed of popular songs that chart high on the Billboard Hot 100 and/or receive heavy airplay from contemporary hit radio stations several months ahead of each album's release. The songs are performed by the Kidz Bop Kids, often with lyrics deemed too inappropriate for younger children altered to be more "kid-friendly", although critics of this approach contend that "repackaging adult music as kids' music" does not remove the adult themes even when words or phrases are substituted.The franchise has sold more than 16 million albums. Since its debut on October 9, 2001, Kidz Bop has expanded to include merchandise, music videos, a live touring division, and talent search competitions. There are 40 main albums as of November 15, 2019.
