Look at Yourself (Uriah Heep song)
Look at Yourself is a song by British progressive rock/hard rock band Uriah Heep which has been originally released on their third studio album, Look at Yourself. The song was the first single by the band in the United Kingdom and was written and sung by Ken Hensley. According to Ken Hensley, the reason that he took over the lead vocals on this song was that Heep frontman David Byron had throat problems during the recording session. However, Byron sang the lead vocals on the song during the band's live performances. "Look at Yourself" was later included on Uriah Heep's first live album, Uriah Heep Live, and on their first compilation album, The Best of Uriah Heep. The song was used in the first episode of the 2006 BBC series Life on Mars. Covers German power metal band Gamma Ray covered this song on their first studio album, Heading for Tomorrow (1990).
