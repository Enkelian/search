LG Philips LCD
LG Display (Korean: LG 디스플레이) is one of the world's largest manufacturer and supplier of thin-film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) panels, OLEDs and flexible displays. LG Display is headquartered in Seoul, South Korea, and currently operates nine fabrication facilities and seven back-end assembly facilities in Korea, China, Poland and Mexico. History LG Display was originally formed as a joint venture by the Korean electronics company LG Electronics and the Dutch company Philips in 1999 to manufacture active matrix liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and was formerly known as LG.Philips LCD, but Philips sold off all its shares in late 2008. Both companies also had another joint venture, called LG.Philips Displays, dedicated to manufacturing cathode ray tubes, deflection yokes, and related materials such as glass and phosphors. On 12 December 2008, LG.Philips LCD announced its plan to change its corporate name to LG Display upon receiving approval at the company's annual general meeting of shareholders on 29 February. The company claimed the name change reflects the company's business scope expansion and business model diversification, the change in corporate governance following the reduction of Philips' equity stake, and LG's commitment to enhanced responsible management. The company has eight manufacturing plants in Gumi
