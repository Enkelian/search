Emeritus
Emeritus (male)/Emerita (female) (), in its current usage, is an adjective used to designate a retired chairperson, professor, pastor, bishop, pope, director, president, prime minister, rabbi, emperor, or other person who has been "permitted to retain as an honorary title the rank of the last office held". Like the Romance languages derived from it, Latin contains many words that are gender-specific; "emeritus" is used for a male, "emerita" for a female. In some cases, the term is conferred automatically upon all persons who retire at a given rank, but in others, it remains a mark of distinguished service, awarded only to a few on retirement. It is also used when a person of distinction in a profession retires or hands over the position, enabling their former rank to be retained in their title, e.g., "professor emeritus". The term emeritus does not necessarily signify that a person has relinquished all the duties of their former position, and they may continue to exercise some of them. Etymology Ēmĕ́rĕre is a compound of the Latin prefix ē- (a variant of ex-) meaning "out of, from" and mĕ́rĕre meaning "earn"; ēmĕ́rĭtus is the past participle of the verb. The female equivalent, ēmĕ́rǐta (), is
