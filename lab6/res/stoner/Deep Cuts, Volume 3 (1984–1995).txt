Deep Cuts, Volume 3 (1984–1995)
Deep Cuts, Volume 3 (1984–1995) is a compilation of Queen featuring some of their lesser-known tracks from between 1984 and 1995. Deep Cuts Volume 3 was released on 5 September 2011, as part of Queen's 40th Anniversary, simultaneously with the third group of five reissues of Queen studio albums (The Works, A Kind of Magic, The Miracle, Innuendo and Made in Heaven) from which the songs are sampled. In this release, "Khashoggi's Ship" has a drum intro (to separate it from the song "Party", which was not included in this compilation) and "It's a Beautiful Day (Reprise)" starts with 15 seconds of slow build-up and ends with "Yeah" (which is a separate track on Made in Heaven). The release date of the album would have also been former lead singer Freddie Mercury's 65th birthday. == Track listing ==
