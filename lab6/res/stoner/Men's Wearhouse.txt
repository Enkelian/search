Today, as Tailored Brands, the company operates Men's Wearhouse, Men's Wearhouse & Tux, K&G Superstores (an off-price retail chain), Moores Clothing for Men (a Canadian chain of men's clothing stores), Twin Hill Corporate clothing, and Jos A. Bank. In 1997, it purchased, then liquidated, the bankrupt Kuppenheimer chain.Men's Wearhouse notably ran television and radio commercials featuring Zimmer, and the oft-repeated slogan, "You're going to like the way you look; I guarantee it."
