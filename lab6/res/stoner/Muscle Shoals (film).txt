Katie Van Syckle of Rolling Stone remarked "But the documentaryâ€™s real highlights are the musings of the musicians who recorded there. Performers including Aretha Franklin, Keith Richards, Mick Jagger, Jimmy Cliff, Ed King and Steve Winwood reflect on what went into creating the magical environment and the legendary recordings that it spawned. Artists were not only prolific in Colbert County, but their recordings were often infused with a recognizable sound Camalier describes as a "funky, soulful, propulsive kind of groove."
