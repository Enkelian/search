Diacetylnalorphine
Diacetylnalorphine (BAN) is an opioid drug described as an analgesic and antidote which was never marketed. It is the 3,6-diacetyl ester of nalorphine, and therefore the heroin analogue of nalorphine. Diacetylnalorphine may behave as a prodrug to nalorphine, similarly to the cases of heroin (diacetylmorphine) to morphine and diacetyldihydromorphine to dihydromorphine.
