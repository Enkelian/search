Ancient Dreams
Ancient Dreams is the third album of Swedish doom metal band Candlemass, released in 1988 and reissued in 2001 by Powerline Records with a bonus CD. The cover art of the album is a painting made by Thomas Cole, second in his series, "The Voyage of Life", entitled "Youth". Ancient Dreams was the first Candlemass album to chart in the US, debuting at No. 174 on the Billboard 200 album chart."Epistle 81" (Märk hur vår skugga), was written by Swedish poet/musician Carl Michael Bellman (1740 – 1795). "Incarnation of Evil" is actually a reworked version of the old Nemesis track "Black Messiah." The band is not happy with the album mix, and they place the blame on their (then) record label rush-producing the LP to coincide with a US tour. Track listing All tracks are written by Leif Edling except where noted.The track "Black Sabbath Medley" is a CD bonus track and is composed of parts of songs from Black Sabbath, namely: "Symptom of the Universe", "Sweet Leaf", "Sabbath Bloody Sabbath", "Into the Void", "Electric Funeral", "Supernaut", "Black Sabbath".
