The Studios
Dock10 (stylised as dock10) is a television facility owner and media services company, located in the City of Salford, Greater Manchester, England. Dock10 offers a number of services including post production and The Studios. Its studio filming facility is the best-known part of the company, often referred to as The Studios. It was built as a major part of MediaCityUK, a development in Salford, Greater Manchester. The move saw a number of major productions leave London for the first time and head north to Manchester.
