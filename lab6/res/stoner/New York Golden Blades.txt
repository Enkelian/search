New York Golden Blades
The New York Raiders were an ice hockey team and founding member of the World Hockey Association based in New York City. Intended to be the WHA's flagship franchise, its short lifespan was a result of being unable to compete with the National Hockey League's established New York Rangers, and the expansion New York Islanders. During its inaugural season, the league had to take ownership of the team. A third owner took over and renamed the franchise the New York Golden Blades to start its second season. The team remained in financial distress and was moved to the Greater Philadelphia metropolitan area township of Cherry Hill, New Jersey on November 21, 1973, becoming the Jersey Knights – its third name and second home, under three different ownership arrangements, in less than two full seasons of operation. New York Raiders The New York Raiders participated in the first WHA draft. Its coach was Camille Henry and the very first draft pick – second overall – was Al Sims. Sims did not, however, play for the Raiders, as he signed with the Boston Bruins instead. The team was initially slated to play in the brand-new Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum on Long Island.
