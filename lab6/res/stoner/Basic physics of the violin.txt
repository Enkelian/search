Basic physics of the violin
The sound of a violin is the result of interactions between its many parts. Drawing a bow across the strings causes the strings to vibrate. This vibration is transmitted through the bridge and sound post to the body of the violin, which allows the sound to effectively radiate into the surrounding air. The tension and type of strings, placement and tension of the sound post, quality of the bow, and the construction of the body, all contribute to the loudness and tonal quality of the sound. Strings The strings of a violin are stretched across the bridge and nut of the violin so that the ends are essentially stationary, allowing for the creation of standing waves. The fundamental frequency and harmonic overtones of the resulting sound depend on the material properties of the string, such as the tension, length, mass, elasticity and damping factor. Tension String tension affects the sound a violin produces in an obvious way. Increasing the tension on a string results in a higher frequency note. The strings of a violin are wrapped around adjustable tuning pegs. By turning its associated peg, each string may be loosened or tightened until it produces the desired pitch, which may
