Paseo del Norte
New Mexico State Road 423 (NM 423) is a 17.0-mile-long (27.4 km) state highway entirely within Bernalillo County, New Mexico. For its entire length, NM-423 is signed as Paseo del Norte in Albuquerque. Route description The highway's western terminus is at Golf Course Road and then proceeds east intersecting NM 45 (signed as Coors Blvd). The highway then continues east intersecting several state highways, and Interstate 25 (I-25). The highway's eastern terminus is at an intersection with NM 556. From NM 45 to I-25, NM 423 is a freeway with a 60 miles per hour (97 km/h) speed limit. From I-25 to its eastern terminus at NM 556, NM 423 is a 6-lane divided highway with at-grade intersections with speed limits of 45-55 MPH. Initial proposals to reconstruct its interchange with I-25 would have also extended the freeway portion of NM 423 east from Jefferson Boulevard east to Louisiana Boulevard. The scaled back design added two flyover ramps to provide high-speed nonstop access between I-25 northbound and NM 423 westbound and also NM 423 eastbound and I-25 southbound. The signalized intersections with the I-25 frontage roads remain in place, the same with at-grade intersections with San Pedro Road and Louisiana
