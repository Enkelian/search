Republic Square (Austin)
Republic Square is an urban park in central Austin, Texas. Located in Downtown Austin, the park features a grassy area meant for festivals and events as well as shaded areas under live oak trees. The Austin Farmers Market meets at the square every Saturday morning. History Originally called 'Hamilton Square', Republic Square was one of four public squares laid out by the city's designer Edwin Waller. The square functioned as a normal urban park up until the mid-twentieth century when it served as a parking lot. The neighborhood surrounding the park became significant for its Mexican American residents in throughout the late 1800s and early 1900s. During the United States Bicentennial, the city of Austin transformed the square to its former glory, and was later revitalized again in 2017. Despite many physical changes, the historic heritage Auction Oaks survived and remain a centerpiece to the square till this day. Transportation hub Republic Square also functions as a downtown hub for the Capital Metropolitan Transportation Authority bus system. Austin's central bus-rapid transit system, Capital MetroRapid Lines 801 and 803 share a stop next to the square (Fourth Street/Guadalupe Street for southbound buses and Fourth Street/Lavaca Street for northbound).
