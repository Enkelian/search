Margin of error
The margin of error is a statistic expressing the amount of random sampling error in the results of a survey. The larger the margin of error, the less confidence one should have that a poll result would reflect the result of a survey of the entire population. The margin of error will be positive whenever a population is incompletely sampled and the outcome measure has positive variance, which is to say, the measure varies. The term margin of error is often used in non-survey contexts to indicate observational error in reporting measured quantities. Concept Consider a simple yes/no poll P {\displaystyle P} as a sample of n {\displaystyle n} respondents drawn from a population N , ( n << N ) {\displaystyle N{\text{, }}(n<<N)} reporting the percentage p {\displaystyle p} of yes responses. We would like to know how close p {\displaystyle p} is to the true result of a survey of the entire population N {\displaystyle N} , without having to conduct one. If, hypothetically, we were to conduct poll P {\displaystyle P} over subsequent samples of n {\displaystyle n} respondents (newly drawn from N {\displaystyle N} ), we would expect those subsequent results p 1 , p 2
