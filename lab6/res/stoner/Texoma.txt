Texoma
Texoma is an interstate region in the United States, split between Oklahoma and Texas. The name is a portmanteau of Texas and Oklahoma. Businesses use the term in their names to describe their intended service area. The eight-county definition of the area (see below) puts Texoma's population at 319,455. Definition Texoma is usually defined as the area on either side of the state border along the Red River valley, in particular the area around Lake Texoma. The surrounding area is alternatively referred to as Texomaland. The Wichita Falls–Lawton and Paris–Hugo areas are sometimes also included in Texoma or Texomaland due to their proximity to the Red River and the Texas/Oklahoma border, but most definitions exclude that area. Texoma mainly comprises the area and cities surrounding Lake Texoma, which includes eight counties. Much of the population is concentrated in the Sherman–Denison Metropolitan Statistical Area and three Micropolitan Statistical Areas. The area around Bonham is also populous. Most of the region is also part of the Dallas–Fort Worth Combined Statistical Area.A portion of Texoma south of Lake Texoma has been designated an American Viticultural Area, the Texoma AVA. The Texas part of Texoma is served by the Texoma Council of Governments. Notable
