Mount Bonnell
Mount Bonnell , also known as Covert Park, is a prominent point alongside the Lake Austin portion of the Colorado River in Austin, Texas. It has been a popular tourist destination since the 1850s. The mount provides a vista for viewing the city of Austin, Lake Austin, and the surrounding hills. It was designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1969, bearing Marker number 6473, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015. Geography Mount Bonnell is located at 30.3210°N, 97.7736°W (WGS 84 datum). The mount is often described as the highest point in Austin, with the elevation at its peak about 775 feet above mean sea level (AMSL). If Mount Bonnell ever held this distinction, it was only because the city limits did not include the next summit to the north, Mount Barker, which has an elevation of about 840 feet above mean sea level (AMSL). Many other areas now in the city of Austin are also higher than Mount Bonnell, but few publicly accessible spots offer such a sweeping view of the downtown area. History Mount Bonnell's Indian Trail A historical marker was placed at Mount Bonnell in 1969 by State Historical Survey Committee.
