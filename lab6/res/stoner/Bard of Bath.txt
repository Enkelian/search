Bard of Bath
The Bard of Bath is the winner of an annual competition to find Bath's best poet, singer or storyteller. The Bard uses the title to develop artistic projects in the area and leads evening bardic walks around the city. The title resurrects an Iron-Age Celtic Druid tradition where Druids were the law-makers, judges and ceremonial leaders, Ovates were mediums, healers and prophets and Bards were poets, musicians and history-keepers. All of them held high status and a place in mystical/religious circles.Each Chaired Bard becomes a member of the Gorsedd and retains their title (specified by year). The current Bard of Bath, as of February 2020, is Tick Rowley. Winners 1. Tim Sebastian, 1996–97 2. Richard Carder, 1997-8 3. Kevan Manwaring, 1998-9 4. Olivia Hicks, 1999–2000 5.
