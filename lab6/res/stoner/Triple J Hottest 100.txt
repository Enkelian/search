Triple J Hottest 100
The Triple J Hottest 100 is an annual music listener poll hosted by the publicly-funded, national Australian radio station, Triple J. The public is invited to vote for their favourite Australian and alternative music of the year, in an online poll conducted two weeks prior to the new year. From 1989 to 2018, the 100 most popular songs were counted down from 12 pm on Australia Day. Since then the countdown has been held on the fourth weekend of January, due to increasing controversy about Australia Day regarding its marking of the colonisation of Australia and dispossession of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander land. On the day after the Hottest 100, Triple J plays the Hottest 200 ('the songs that didn't quite make it') from 10am.The poll has grown from 500,000 votes in 2004 to over 3.2 million in 2019, and has subsequently been referred to as "the world's greatest music democracy", and inspired a retrospective podcast. Following the completion of each year's countdown, a compilation CD featuring highlight tracks is released by ABC Music. Billie Eilish's "Bad Guy" is the most recent song to top the Hottest 100.
