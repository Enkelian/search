Western Bloc
The Western Bloc during the Cold War refers to the capitalist countries who were under the hegemony of the United States and NATO against the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact. The latter were referred to as the Eastern Bloc. The governments and press of the Western Bloc were more inclined to refer to themselves as the "Free World" or the "Western world", whereas the Eastern Bloc was often called the "Communist world or Second world". Since the end of the Cold War, until recently, further escalation between China and Russia became tense since the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999, such as the conflicts in the Middle East (particularly in Iran, Syria and Yemen), Venezuela and Ukraine.
