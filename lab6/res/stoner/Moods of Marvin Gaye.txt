Moods of Marvin Gaye
Moods of Marvin Gaye is the seventh studio album by Marvin Gaye, released on the Tamla label in 1966. The album's plan was to establish the singer as a strong albums-oriented artist, as well as a hit maker, although Gaye was still uncomfortable with performing strictly R&B. He had begun work on a standards album around this time after meeting musician Bobby Scott. However, sessions were unsuccessful. Gaye would successfully complete a standards album only in his later years, an album which would be released posthumously (That album would be Vulnerable released in 1997). For the time being, Gaye was winning more fans and had become a crossover teen idol. Six songs from Moods of Marvin Gaye were released as singles: impressively, all reached the Top 40 on the R&B singles chart and four of them reached the Top 40 on the Pop Singles Chart, a rare feat for a solo R&B artist even at that time. Gaye also scored his first two #1 R&B singles, "I'll Be Doggone" and "Ain't That Peculiar", both co-written by Gaye's friend, Berry Gordy's right-hand man Smokey Robinson.
