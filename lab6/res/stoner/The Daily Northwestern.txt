The Daily Northwestern
The Daily Northwestern is the student newspaper at Northwestern University which is published on weekdays during the academic year. Founded in 1881, and printed in Evanston, Illinois, it is staffed only by undergraduates, many of whom are students at Northwestern's Medill School of Journalism. The Daily has won the Columbia Scholastic Press Association and Associated Collegiate Press Pacemaker Awards.It is owned by Students Publishing Company, which also publishes Syllabus, the university yearbook. Current circulation is in excess of 7,500. The Daily Northwestern is the only daily for both Northwestern and Evanston.The paper's offices are located on the third floor of Norris University Center on the Evanston campus. In 2015, The Daily launched "The Campaign for the Future of The Daily Northwestern," a five-year fundraising campaign. Early history The Daily descends from two earlier publications, the Tripod and Vidette, the older of which began publishing in 1871. In 1881, in what is considered The Daily's founding moment, the two papers merged to become The Northwestern, which would only gradually shed its literary-journal roots. Publication increased to five days a week by 1910. Independence from the university followed in 1923. Notable alumni of The Daily Northwestern J.A. Adande - ESPN.com sports columnist
