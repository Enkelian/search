Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen
The Saudi-led intervention in Yemen, also called the Arab coalition (Arabic: التحالف العربي‎), is an intervention launched by Saudi Arabia in 2015, leading a coalition of nine countries from West Asia and Africa, in response to calls from the internationally recognized pro-Saudi president of Yemen Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi for military support after he was ousted by the Houthi movement due to economic and political grievances, and fled to Saudi Arabia.Code-named Operation Decisive Storm (Arabic: عملية عاصفة الحزم‎ Amaliyyat 'Āṣifat al-Ḥazm), the intervention is said to be in compliance with Article 2(4) of the UN Charter by the international community; but this has been contested by some academics. The intervention initially consisted of a bombing campaign on Houthi rebels and later a naval blockade and the deployment of ground forces into Yemen. The Saudi-led coalition has attacked the positions of the Houthi militia, and loyalists of the former President of Yemen, Ali Abdullah Saleh, allegedly supported by Iran (see Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy conflict).Fighter jets and ground forces from Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, Sudan, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and Academi (formerly Blackwater) took part in the operation. Djibouti, Eritrea, and Somalia made their airspace, territorial waters, and military bases available
