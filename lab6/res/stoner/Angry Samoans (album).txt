Angry Samoans (album)
Angry Samoans is the fifth studio album by the American hip hop group Boo-Yaa T.R.I.B.E. It was released internationally on May 20, 1997 through the band's own record label, First Kut Organization. Upon release, the group embarked on a tour of Europe to promote the album.In contrast to the group's early work, which were in line with funk and West Coast hip hop styles of Above the Law, N.W.A, and Kid Frost, the album features a rap metal sound that is entirely reliant on live drums and guitars. The album's lyrical themes include homicide, carjacking, and marijuana use.
