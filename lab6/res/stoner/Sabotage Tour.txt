Sabotage Tour
The Sabotage Tour was a concert tour by British heavy metal band Black Sabbath. It began on 14 July 1975 and ended on 13 January 1976. Kiss supported at a handful of dates on the first and second North American legs. "I don't particularly like Kiss," said Tony Iommi the following year. "They're not my type of band at all. Their stage show was done long before by Arthur Brown." "They're laying down what they want to lay down," conceded Bill Ward. "What they're laying down, I don't particularly like. We're not in competition though. We're not out to say, 'We're better than you, Jack.' We did six years of that."
