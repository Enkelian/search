KEDGE Business School
KEDGE Business School is a Triple Accredited (AACSB, EQUIS AND AMBA) French business school and Grande École. With campuses in Marseille, Bordeaux, Toulon, Paris, Shanghai and Suzhou, the school is the result of merger between two French business schools: BEM (ESC Bordeaux, founded in 1874) and Euromed (ESC Marseille, founded in 1872). International rankings In 2019, the Financial Times has ranked KEDGE's Master in Management 49th worldwide, and the Executive MBA 31st in Europe. BEM - Bordeaux Management School The current Bordeaux campus of KEDGE is the former BEM (Bordeaux École de Management), a French grande école founded in 1874. Campus extension In 2018, the expansion project in the Luminy campus (in the Adhesion Zone of the Calanques Natural park) is still controversial, with plans to modify 11.000 square meters of nature. According to critics, around 600 centennial trees will be cut down while the director of school says the old trees will be preserved.
