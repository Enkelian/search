A pagoda style building was provided from the outset.A two-lever ground frame gave access to the sidings of Eastern United Colliery until 1912 when a new goods loop was provided on the west side of the single line.The points and signals were worked from a new 21 lever signal box, containing a frame of 17 working levers and 4 spare. The new facilities had been installed and were in use by December 1913.The frame was later extended to 23 levers in the connection with the installation of the Cast House Sidings on the East side of the single line.
