Hollinndagain
Hollinndagain is the first live album and second collaborative album by Avey Tare, Panda Bear and Geologist, released in 2002 on the label St. Ives. It was later retroactively classified as the first live album by experimental pop band Animal Collective. Only 300 copies were initially made; each and every copy featured a unique cover, handmade by the band themselves. For several years it was a vinyl-only release; Animal Collective's own label, Paw Tracks, re-released the album on October 31, 2006, on both CD and vinyl. Although Hollinndagain is a live album, the group regard it as their third official album because it contained all new material at the time it was released, except "Lablakely Dress" which previously appeared on Danse Manatee. The title is garbled Icelandic for "Palace of the Day". Background Hollinndagain is a collection of live material from around the time of the band's second album, Danse Manatee. The first three songs were recorded during a performance on New Jersey radio station WFMU; the final four were culled from live shows in New York, Nashville and Austin with Black Dice in the summer of 2001.
