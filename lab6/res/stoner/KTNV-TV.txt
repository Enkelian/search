KTNV-TV, virtual and VHF digital channel 13, is an ABC-affiliated television station licensed to Las Vegas, Nevada, United States. The station is owned by the E. W. Scripps Company. KTNV's studios are located on South Valley View Boulevard in the nearby unincorporated community of Paradise (though with a Las Vegas mailing address), and its transmitter is located atop Mount Arden in Henderson. History The station, originally owned by the TV Company of America, Inc., signed on the air for the first time on May 4, 1956 as KSHO-TV. Before then, ABC had been relegated to off-hours clearances on NBC affiliate KLRJ/KORK-TV (channel 3, now KSNV-DT) and CBS affiliate KLAS-TV (channel 8). In 1979, KSHO was purchased by WTMJ, Inc., the broadcasting division of The Journal Company; the acquisition made it Journal's second television station property (and its first television station acquisition outside of the company's headquarters of Milwaukee). The station changed its callsign to KTNV-TV on March 2, 1980 (the -TV suffix was removed from 1988 to 2009).KTNV originally transmitted its signal from a tower located right outside the station at the intersection of Desert Inn Road and Valley View Boulevard, on the quadruple border of city of Las Vegas,
