Highlands–Douglass is a neighborhood five miles (8 km) southeast of downtown Louisville, Kentucky, USA. The neighborhood is bound by Bardstown Road, Speed Avenue, Taylorsville Road, and Cherokee Park. It is considered a part of a larger area of Louisville called The Highlands. It is often simply called Douglass. History Pre-subdivision The area was originally part of a 200-acre (0.81 km2) estate belonging to Mississippi plantation owner Stark Fielding. It was referred to as the "Woodbourne Estate." In 1870, the land was bought by then Western Union president George Douglass, for whom the area is named. The distinctive estate home still stands, located behind Douglass Boulevard Christian Church. The large white-columned Southern Colonial mansion was originally built by Fielding in the 1830s, and from the 1930s until 1949 was Rugby University School, an exclusive boy's preparatory school. The church has owned the house since 1949 and uses it for offices and meeting space. After George Douglass died, the land passed to his daughter. The area was subdivided and developed after the opening of Cherokee Park, to which the family donated several acres in exchange for the right to connect subdivisions to the park. Part of the Douglass donation included "Big Rock,"
