Famous Studios
Famous Studios (renamed Paramount Cartoon Studios in 1957) was the first animation division of the film studio Paramount Pictures from 1942 to 1967. Famous was founded as a successor company to Fleischer Studios, after Paramount seized control of the aforementioned studio and ousted its founders, Max and Dave Fleischer, in 1941. The studio's productions included three series started by the Fleischers—Popeye the Sailor, Superman, and Screen Songs—as well as Little Audrey, Little Lulu, Casper the Friendly Ghost, Honey Halfwitch, Herman and Katnip, Baby Huey, and the anthology Noveltoons series. The Famous name was previously used as Famous Players Film Company, one of several companies which in 1912 became Famous Players-Lasky Corporation, the company which founded Paramount Pictures. Paramount's music publishing branch, which held the rights to all of the original music in the Fleischer/Famous cartoons, was named Famous Music. Many of the Famous Studios productions are currently owned by AT&T's WarnerMedia and Warner Bros. through Turner Entertainment (for Popeye The Sailor (1942–1957) and Superman (1942–1943)) and Comcast's NBCUniversal and Universal Pictures through DreamWorks Animation/Classic Media for Harvey Comics (October 1950–1964 and Felix the Cat (1958–1962)). The April 1962–1967 cartoons, including two 1960s cartoons featuring Little Lulu, are still owned by
