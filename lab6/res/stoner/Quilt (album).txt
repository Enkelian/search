Quilt (album)
Quilt is the debut studio album by American psychedelic indie rock band Quilt, released on November 8, 2011 on Mexican Summer.The album was engineered and produced by Jesse Gallagher in Cambridge, Massachusetts in Summer 2010 and Summer 2011 and was mastered by Jeff Lipton and mastering assistant Maria Rice in Newton, Massachusetts in Winter 2010 and Summer 2011. Background and recording Upon finishing their studies, Shane Butler and Anna Fox Rochinki began recording with Jesse Gallagher at his local Cambridge (MA) studio. Initially, McVay still participated in these sessions, but Andrews soon began to join in what was a collaborative recording process from the outset. With no budget to speak of, the band recorded when they had the opportunity to do so, which resulted in a number of scattered sessions over the course of a year. Gallagher as the engineer and producer, played an important role in the process and "pulled us from the murky depths of scratchy and reverby lo-fi recording up in the heights of snazzier sounds and proper vocal treatments", according to Rochinski. The first result of these sessions was the single 'Cowboys in the Void' b/w 'Penobska Oakwalk' that appeared on Burger Records in March 2011.
