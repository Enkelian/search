Central Committee elected by the 14th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)
The Central Committee (CC) composition was elected by the 14th Congress, and sat from 31 December 1925 until 19 December 1927. The CC 1st Plenary Session renewed the composition of the Politburo, Secretariat and the Organizational Bureau (OB) of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). Keys Plenums The CC was not a permanent institution. It convened plenary sessions, one emergency session, four CC plenary sessions and six joint CCâ€“Central Control Commission (CCC) plenary sessions were held between the 14th Congress and the 15th Congress. When the CC was not in session, decision-making powers were transferred to inner bodies of the CC itself; the Politburo, Secretariat and Orgburo (none of these bodies were permanent either, but convened several times a months). Apparatus Individuals employed by Central Committee's bureaus, departments and newspapers made up the apparatus between the 14th Congress and the 15th Congress. The bureaus and departments were supervised by the Secretariat, and each secretary (member of the Secretariat) supervised a specific department. The leaders of departments were officially referred to as Heads, while the titles of bureau leaders varied between chairman, first secretary and secretary.
