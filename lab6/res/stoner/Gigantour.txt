Gigantour
Gigantour was a sporadically organised traveling heavy metal music festival organized by Megadeth's Dave Mustaine. The tour was founded in 2005 with dates across North America (see also Gigantour 2005), and the 2006 and 2007 line-ups also traveled to Australia. The bands appearing at the festival were chosen by Mustaine. The tour is set as an alternative to tours such as Ozzfest. The name "Gigantour" was inspired by the classic 1960s anime Gigantor. The most recent Gigantour took place in 2013. The Festival The lineup of the inaugural Gigantour was composed of bands that Dave Mustaine particularly enjoyed touring with in the past.
