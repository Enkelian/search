Dihydromorphine
Dihydromorphine (Paramorfan, Paramorphan) is a semi-synthetic opioid structurally related to and derived from morphine. The 7,8-double bond in morphine is reduced to a single bond to get dihydromorphine. Dihydromorphine is a moderately strong analgesic and is used clinically in the treatment of pain and also is an active metabolite of the analgesic opioid drug dihydrocodeine. Dihydromorphine occurs in trace quantities in assays of opium on occasion, as does dihydrocodeine, dihydrothebaine, tetrahydrothebaine, etc. The process for manufacturing dihydromorphine from morphine for pharmaceutical use was developed in Germany in the late 19th century, with the synthesis being published in 1900 and the drug introduced clinically as Paramorfan shortly thereafter. A high-yield synthesis from tetrahydrothebaine was later developed. Uses Medical Dihydromorphine is used for the management of moderate to severe pain such as that occurring in cancer; however, it is less effective in treating neuropathic pain and is generally considered inappropriate and ineffective for psychological pain. Research Dihydromorphine, often labelled with the isotope tritium in the form of [3H]-dihydromorphine, is used in scientific research to study binding of the opioid receptors in the nervous system. Strength Dihydromorphine is slightly stronger than morphine as an analgesic with a similar side effect profile. The relative
