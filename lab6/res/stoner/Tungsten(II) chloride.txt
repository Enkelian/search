Tungsten(II) chloride
Tungsten(II) chloride is the inorganic compound with the formula W6Cl12. It is a polymeric cluster compound. The material dissolves in concentrated hydrochloric acid, forming (H3O)2[W6Cl14](H2O)x. Heating this salt gives yellow-brown W6Cl12. The structural chemistry resembles that observed for molybdenum(II) chloride. Tungsten(II) chloride is prepared by reduction of the hexachloride. Bismuth is a typical reductant: 6 WCl6 + 8 Bi â†’ W6Cl12 + 8 BiCl3 . == References ==
