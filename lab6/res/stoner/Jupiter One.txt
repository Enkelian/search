Jupiter One
Jupiter One was an American indie rock band from Brooklyn, New York, formed in 2003. Inspired by a wide range of influences, they create upbeat indie pop songs, with a grounding in futuristic-sounding new wave-style synth sounds. Their self-titled and self-released debut album was distributed by Cordless Recordings in 2007, following another release of the album in 2008 under the Cordless Recordings label. The album Sunshower followed in 2009. Band history Kaoru Ishibashi and Zac Colwell are the founding members of the group. Other members are K's wife Mocha, a Japanese-born keyboardist and violinist, drummer Dave Heilman, and bassist Pat "Panda" Dougherty. K also performs in of Montreal, Regina Spektor's touring band, and a solo project, Kishi Bashi. Ishibashi and Colwell first met while travelling musicians in the orchestra of Barnum's Kaleidoscape. After the circus tour ended they spent time in Zac's hometown of Austin before moving to New York in 2003, where Jupiter One would officially form. In New York, Ishibashi re-connected with then-girlfriend Mocha, a Japanese-born keyboardist and fellow violinist who also joined the group. Drummer Dave Heilman and bassist Pat "Panda" Dougherty later joined the band. The band is named after the spaceship in the '60s television
