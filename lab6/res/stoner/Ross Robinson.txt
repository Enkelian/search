Robinson has also worked with Tech N9ne, Machine Head, The Cure, Sepultura, and many others. Biography The son of inspirational speaker Byron Katie, Robinson began as a thrash metal guitarist for the bands Detente and Murdercar (featuring future Machine Head drummer Dave McClain) and picked up his knowledge of producing from the studios where his band recorded demos and also worked at Blackie Lawless's studio, Fort Apache, in Burbank, CA. Robinson received his first production job for the 1991 Fear Factory album Concrete. Robinson would use the album as a showcase of sorts in helping him land producing slots with other acts, particularly the up-and-coming band Korn. Robinson is regarded as "The Godfather of Nu Metal", along with Korn frontman Jonathan Davis, despite denouncing the nu metal movement later on for becoming complacent and the newer bands for not expanding on the style that he helped create with Korn's first album, Korn (1994).Robinson has also been successful in the post-hardcore genre, producing At the Drive-In's album, Relationship of Command in 2000,
