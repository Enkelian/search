1968 Detroit riot
The 1968 Detroit riot was a civil disturbance that occurred between April 4–5, 1968 in Detroit, Michigan following the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. Less than a year after the violent unrest of 1967, areas of 12th Street (present-day Rosa Parks Boulevard) again erupted in chaos (simultaneously with 110 other US cities) following King's assassination. Michigan Governor George W. Romney ordered the National Guard into Detroit. One person was killed, and gangs tossed objects at cars and smashed storefront windows with three dozen fires being set.
