Kisstory is a UK radio station, a sister station to Kiss that plays "old skool and anthems". Kisstory is also currently a radio programme airing 8 hours per week (11am daily & 7pm Sunday).

DAB availability Initially, Kisstory was available over Freeview and online, but was unavailable via DAB radio receivers.

The DAB service of Kisstory was rolled out to more areas of the country at the start of 2015, replacing Absolute Radio 60s in some areas (including Bauer's owned digital multiplexes in northern England) and added in new space on others; this formed part of a wider reshuffle of Bauer's digital offering,
