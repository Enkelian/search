Tacoma Dome
The Tacoma Dome is a multi-purpose arena in the northwest United States, located in Tacoma, Washington, approximately 30 miles (50 km) south of Seattle, and adjacent to Interstate 5. History Upon winning an international design competition, local architects McGranahan and Messenger completed the Tacoma Dome for $44 million; it opened 37 years ago on April 21, 1983. The arena seats 20,722 for basketball; 530 feet (160 m) in diameter and 152 feet (46 m) in height, it is able to seat 23,000, and is the largest arena with a wooden dome in the world by volume. The Superior Dome in Marquette, Michigan, is a larger-diameter geodesic dome at 536 feet (163 m), but is 143 feet (44 m) high and seats a maximum of 16,000.The wood used to make the roof came from trees that were downed in the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. Unlike most other arenas of its size, the arena contains little in the way of fixed seating, so as to maximize the flexibility of the seating arrangements and of the shape of the playing field. It can host American football, albeit with seating reduced to 10,000. The dome's first event was a concert by British
