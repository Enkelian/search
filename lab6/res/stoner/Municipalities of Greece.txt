Municipalities of Greece
The municipalities of Greece (Greek: δήμοι, romanized: dhími, [ˈði.mi]) are the lowest level of government within the organizational structure of that country. Since the 2011 Kallikratis reform, there are 325 municipalities. Thirteen administrative regions form the largest unit of government beneath the State. Within these regions are 74 second-level areas called regional units. Regional units are then divided into municipalities. The new municipalities can be subdivided into municipal units (δημοτικές ενότητες, dimotikes enotites, the old municipalities), which are subdivided into municipal communities (δημοτικές κοινότητες, dimotikés koinótites) or local communities (τοπικές κοινότητες, topikés koinótites). Constitutional provisions for communities and municipalities Article 102 of the Greek constitution outlines the mandate of municipalities and communities and their relationship to the larger State: Municipalities and communities exercise administration of local affairs independently. Leadership of municipalities and communities is elected by universal and secret ballot. Municipalities may voluntarily or be mandated by law to work together to provide certain services, but elected representatives from the participating groups govern these partnerships. The national Greek government supervises local government agencies, but is not to interfere in any local initiatives or actions. The State is required to provide funds necessary to fulfill the mandate of local government agencies.
