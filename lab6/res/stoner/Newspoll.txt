Newspoll
Newspoll is an Australian opinion polling brand, published by The Australian and administered by international market research and data analytics group, YouGov. Newspoll has a long tradition of accuracy with regard to predicting Australian Federal Election results (with the exception of the 2019 election).Until May 2015, Newspoll was a market research and polling company, part owned by News Corp Australia. Its founding Managing Director was Solomon Lebovic who led the company from 1985 to 2005. Martin O'Shannessy was CEO since late 2005 until the dissolution of Cudex, the joint venture company running Newspoll. While the former Newspoll was well known for political polling, over 90% of its activities were in commercial market research. In May 2015 administration of Newspoll was transferred to Galaxy Research. In December 2017, Galaxy Research was acquired by YouGov.Newspoll's surveys of voting intention are published exclusively in The Australian. In addition, many organisations from both sides of the political divide and within the business community commissioned public opinion polling from the former Newspoll. Newspoll was established in 1985 as a joint venture between News Limited and Yann Campbell Hoare Wheeler, which later was purchased by Millward Brown during the 1990s leading to the current ownership structure.
