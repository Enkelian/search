Changes (David Bowie song)
"Changes" is a song by English singer-songwriter David Bowie, originally released on the album Hunky Dory in December 1971 and as a single on 7 January 1972, the day before Bowie's 25th birthday. Despite missing the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100, "Changes" became one of Bowie's best-known songs. The lyrics are often seen as a manifesto for his chameleonic personality, the frequent change of the world today, and frequent reinventions of his musical style throughout the 1970s. This single has been cited as David Bowie's official US debut, despite the fact that the song "The Man Who Sold the World" was released in the US two years prior. "Changes" was the last song Bowie performed live on stage before his retirement from live performances at the end of 2006.The song ranked number 128 on the Rolling Stone list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. It is one of four of Bowie's songs to be included in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. It was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2016. It charted for the first time on the UK Singles Chart on 15 January 2016
