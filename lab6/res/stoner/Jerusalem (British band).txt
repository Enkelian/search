Jerusalem (British band)
Jerusalem are a British hard rock band, not to be confused with the Swedish Christian hard rock band of the same name who were formed a few years later in 1975. History The five-member band released one self-titled album worldwide in 1972 on Deram Records (UK catalogue number: SLD 6), produced by Ian Gillan of Deep Purple. Their only other release that decade was a 45 rpm 7 inch single, the non-album "Kamikaze Moth" backed with "Frustration" from the LP. They gigged throughout Europe and shared the same stage as bands such as Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Uriah Heep and Status Quo. They also played at some of the major festivals in Europe. Although Jerusalem signed with Deram, Nick Mobbs, head of EMI's Harvest Records label also wanted them; he later became head of A&R for EMI and was the first person to sign the Sex Pistols. Founders of the band, Paul Dean and Ray Sparrow, eventually split the band, and formed a three piece with Bob Cooke called Pussy, who released a single on Deram called "Feline Woman". Jerusalem's debut album was re-issued by Universal as a Japanese CD (2005), and has also become available through many rock music
