George Washington (Greenough)
George Washington, also known as Enthroned Washington, is a large marble sculpture by Horatio Greenough commissioned for the centennial of U.S President George Washington's birth in February 22, 1732. Completed in 1840, the statue was soon exhibited in the Rotunda of the United States Capitol and then moved to the Capitol's east lawn in 1843.Horatio Greenough based Enthroned Washington on Phidias' great statue of Zeus Olympios which was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and which was destroyed in late Antiquity. Description The seated and sandal wearing Washington gazes sternly ahead. He is bare-chested and his right arm and hand gesture with upraised index finger toward Heaven. His left palm and forearm cradle a sheathed sword, hilt forward, symbolizing Washington turning over power to the people at the conclusion of the American Revolutionary War. The representation of Washington in Roman clothing is indicative of the Neoclassicism period of art. The rear base of the statue features a Latin inscription, which reads: SIMULACRUM ISTUD AD MAGNUM LIBERTATIS EXEMPLUM NEC SINE IPSA DURATURUM HORATIUS GREENOUGH FACIEBAT and translates as: "Horatio Greenough made this image as a great example of freedom, which will not survive without freedom itself."
