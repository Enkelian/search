Dniproavia
Dniproavia (Ukrainian: Дніпроавіа) was an airline headquartered at Dnipro International Airport in Dnipro, Ukraine, operated scheduled and chartered passenger flights. History Dniproavia was established in 1933 as Dnipropetrovsk Integrated Air Squad, forming part of then Soviet national airline Aeroflot. On 22 June 1996, the airline became a joint stock company in a state-owned entity which included Dnipropetrovsk International Airport, thus giving the airline full control over its home base. Dniproavia announced a loss of just over 6 million USD for 2006, despite increasing revenues by 17 percent and carrying 54 percent more passengers. It blamed the loss on the suspension of its flights to Germany, due to a dispute with the German authorities over Lufthansa's landing rights at Dnipropetrovsk Airport. In October 2009, the airline was sold to Galtera investment group, however, it was controlled by Ukrainian-Israeli entrepreneur Ihor Kolomoyskyi's Privat Group.As of 25 March 2012, as a result of the Anti-monopoly committee of Ukraine's decision to allow the consolidation of the Ukrainian Aviation Group's physical and operational assets, Dniproavia no longer operates flights with its own code, but rather on behalf of its parent company Aerosvit. By mid of June 2012 the airline introduced their first Embraer 190. All
