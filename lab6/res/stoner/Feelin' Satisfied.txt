Feelin' Satisfied
"Feelin' Satisfied" is a 1978 song written by Tom Scholz for the Boston band album Don't Look Back. Paul Grein of Billboard described the song as "an affectionate tribute to the power of music." The same magazine later described the song as an "upbeat track which is totally rock 'n' roll," praising the "clear singing" and "fresh sounds." Terry Hazlett of The Observer-Reporter described the song as an "innocent little [ditty]" which comes across like a "rock 'n' roll anthem." AXS contributor Bill Craig describes the lyrics as being about "the wonders of rock music." Pete Bishop of The Pittsburgh Press claimed that it has "an infectious happy feel." Ultimate Classic Rock critic Michael Gallucci described it as a "simple" song that, in common with many Boston songs, "celebrates rock 'n' roll." Gallucci rated it Boston's 8th greatest song, particularly praising the effect from the hand claps during the refrain. Paul Elliott rated it their 7th greatest song, commenting on its "sense of fun" as Scholz lets go of some of his usual control. Chart positions "Feelin' Satisfied" was later released as a single and went up to #46 on the Billboard Hot 100. It only reached #84 in Canada.
