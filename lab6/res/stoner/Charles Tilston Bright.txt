Sir Charles Tilston Bright (8 June 1832 â€“ 3 May 1888) was a British electrical engineer who oversaw the laying of the first transatlantic telegraph cable in 1858, for which work he was knighted. Life Born on 8 June 1832 in Wanstead, Essex, Bright was educated at Merchant Taylors' School.At fifteen he became a clerk for the Electric Telegraph Company and as his talent for electrical engineering became evident, he was appointed engineer to the Magnetic Telegraph Company in 1852. In that role he supervised the laying of lines in the British Isles, including in 1853 the first cable between Scotland and Ireland, from Portpatrick to Donaghadee, when he was just 21.

Samuel Canning supported the effort on board HMS Agamemnon.After two failed attempts in August
