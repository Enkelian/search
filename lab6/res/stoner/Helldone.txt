Helldone
Helldone was an annual music festival organized by Finnish gothic rock band HIM. Typically held on 31 December at the Tavastia Club, and its companion club the Semifinal, in Helsinki, Finland, Helldone began in 1999 as an annual New Year's Eve show for HIM, which grew out of vocalist Ville Valo's "hatred for music parties" and need to "do something more than just get fucked up at midnight". The shows were expanded into a festival in 2005 and renamed Helldone after the band's booking agent Tiina Vuorinen, n√©e Welldone, and their hometown of Helsinki. Helldone also took-up a policy of named tickets, where attendees were required to provide identification matching their ticket upon entry to the venue.In 2008, Helldone was expanded into a tour, which took the festival across Finland, before returning to Helsinki on New Year's Eve. Helldone took breaks in 2010 and 2011, partly due to HIM drummer Gas Lipstick's health issues, before returning in 2012. The festival took another break in 2016, due to the band members' other commitments. On 7 August 2017, HIM announced the return of Helldone for 31 December 2017, which would also serve as the band's final show before disbanding. Additional dates were
