Niobium(V) chloride
Niobium(V) chloride, also known as niobium pentachloride, is a yellow crystalline solid. It hydrolyzes in air, and samples are often contaminated with small amounts of NbOCl3. It is often used as a precursor to other compounds of niobium. NbCl5 may be purified by sublimation. Structure and properties Niobium(V) chloride forms chloro-bridged dimers in the solid state (see figure). Each niobium centre is six-coordinate, but the octahedral coordination is significantly distorted. The equatorial niobium–chlorine bond lengths are 225 pm (terminal) and 256 pm (bridging), whilst the axial niobium-chlorine bonds are 229.2 pm and are deflected inwards to form an angle of 83.7° with the equatorial plane of the molecule. The Nb–Cl–Nb angle at the bridge is 101.3°. The Nb–Nb distance is 398.8 pm, too long for any metal-metal interaction. NbBr5, TaCl5 and TaBr5 are isostructural with NbCl5, but NbI5 and TaI5 have different structures. Preparation Industrially, niobium pentachloride is obtained by direct chlorination of niobium metal at 300 to 350 °C: 2 Nb + 5 Cl2 → 2 NbCl5In the laboratory, niobium pentachloride is often prepared from Nb2O5, the main problem being incomplete reaction to give the oxyhalides. The conversion can be effected with thionyl chloride: It also can be prepared
