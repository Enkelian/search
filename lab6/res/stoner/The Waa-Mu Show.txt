The Waa-Mu Show
The Waa-Mu Show (pronounced "wah mew") is a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization within Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, that produces student written, orchestrated, produced, and performed original musical theatre work every year. The song lyrics, script, and music are developed in a series of classes. It is the institution's longest standing theatrical tradition and is held in Cahn Auditorium on Northwestern's campus. This tradition began as a musical revue, showcasing several different student-written Northwestern-inspired vignettes connected by one single theme. By 2013, the Waa-Mu show evolved into an original full-length musical. History The first Waa-Mu show took place in 1929. A senior Northwestern student Joseph W.
