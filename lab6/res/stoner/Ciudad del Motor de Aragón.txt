Ciudad del Motor de Aragón
The Ciudad del Motor de Aragón, also known as Motorland Aragón, is a 5.344 km (3.321 mi) motorsport race track located in Alcañiz, Spain. The circuit has been designed by well-known German architect Hermann Tilke in conjunction with the British architectural firm Foster + Partners. Formula One driver and Ferrari test driver Pedro de la Rosa was a technical and sporting consultant on the project.The facility has been designed to incorporate three main zones – a technology park, a sports area and a leisure and culture area. The technology park will feature research and educational institutes related to the motor industry, the sports area will include the racing circuit (with multiple layouts), a karting track and various gravel circuits, whilst the leisure and culture section will feature a hotel, business centre and shopping facilities. It was announced on 26 May 2008 that the circuit will host a round of the World Series by Renault in 2009, the first international championship to race at the venue. The event has returned to Aragón every year since, until the end of the championship in 2015. Renault Sport Technologies had access to the circuit for thirty days per year for testing and promotional events.
