Sberbank Europe provides financial services to over 740,000 customers in eight countries in Central and Eastern Europe. History Sberbank Europe AG was established in 2012 after Sberbank of Russia acquired Volksbank International AG (VBI) and rebranded it into Sberbank Europe. The deal involved all VBI assets – banks in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Serbia, Slovenia, Ukraine and Slovakia, apart from Volksbank Romania. Société Générale and J.P.Morgan acted as financial advisors to Sberbank. Troika Dialog also advised on the transaction. The deal price was €505 million, which is 1.0x VBI book value (excluding Romania). Organizational transformation and group restructuring were exercised during that period. The regional headquarter of Sberbank Europe Group was decided to be in Vienna, Austria. In 2013, Sberbank Europe received a full banking license in Austria and obtained its first Fitch Ratings investment grade BBB- Fitch affirmed its rating of Sberbank as ‘BB+’ with positive outreach in 2017. In 2019, Fitch upgraded the Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of Sberbank Europe to ‘BBB-‘. By 2014, rebranding of Volksbank subsidiaries into Sberbank was fully completed.
