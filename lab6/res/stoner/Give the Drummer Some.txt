Give the Drummer Some
Give the Drummer Some is the first solo record by American drummer Travis Barker. Barker had earlier announced that the album would be slated for a September 2010 release, but was later pushed back, with the album being released on March 15, 2011. The album, released under Interscope Records, was produced by the drummer himself, alongside The Neptunes, RZA, Kool Kojak, Chuck Inglish, Transplants, Kid Cudi, edIT, Corey Taylor and Steve Aoki. The album debuted at number nine on the US Billboard 200 chart, with first-week sales of 28,000 copies in the United States. Background The album title itself is a reference to a track by the Ultramagnetic MC's of the same name, which in turn derives from James Brown's "Funky Drummer." It was first announced by Barker himself that the album would be of "no one genre," indicating that the album wouldn't be based on hip hop or punk rock, unlike his previous remixes and collaborations. However, most of the tracks are hip hop and R&B influenced, though for instance "Misfits" has a techno and dance sound and "On My Own" has a metal groove to it. Guests that collaborated and are featured are: Slaughterhouse, The Cool Kids, RZA,
