Albuquerque Basin
The Albuquerque Basin (or Middle Rio Grande Basin) is one of the largest and deepest of the structural basins in the Rio Grande rift. It contains the city of Albuquerque, New Mexico. Geologically, the Albuquerque Basin is a half-graben that slopes down towards the east to terminate on the Sandia and Manzano mountains. It has a semi-arid climate, with large areas that count as desert. From Paleo-Indian traces dating back 12,000 years, the climate used to be wetter and more fertile than it is today. The Rio Grande flows through the basin from north to south. Its valley has been irrigated for at least 1,000 years. Intense irrigation began in the late nineteenth century with new dams, levees and ditches and has caused environmental problems. In times of low water levels in the Rio Grande, Albuquerque relies on groundwater for its potable water supply. The aquifer is composed of deposits from the ancestral Rio Grande and the size of its annual resource follows fluctuations in weather and climate phenomena. There may be natural gas in the basin, but opponents to production fear the impact on the groundwater and on the quality of life. Location The Albuquerque Basin covers 8,000 square
