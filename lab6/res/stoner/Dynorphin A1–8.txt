Dynorphin A1–8
Dynorphin A is a form of dynorphin and an endogenous opioid peptide with the amino acid sequence: Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Leu-Arg-Arg-Ile-Arg-Pro-Lys-Leu-Lys. Dynorphin A1–8 is a truncated form of dynorphin A with the amino acid sequence: Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Leu-Arg-Arg-Ile. Dynorphin A1–8 is an agonist at the mu-, kappa-, and delta-opioid receptors; it has the highest binding affinity for the kappa-opioid receptor. == References ==
