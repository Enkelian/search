Ask for It
Ask for It is an EP by American alternative rock band Hole, released on September 8, 1995. It was the band's second and last release on Caroline Records, the first being their debut album Pretty on the Inside (1991). Although the EP was released after 1994's platinum-selling Live Through This, its contents were recorded by an earlier lineup of the band between 1991 and 1992. The EP comprises three songs by Hole as well as several cover versions of songs by the Wipers, Beat Happening, The Velvet Underground, and the Germs. The recordings featured on the EP originate from several sources, including two studio sessions: a November 19, 1991 John Peel session for the BBC, and a March 1992 studio recording session for a Wipers tribute album; as well as a live performance at the Whisky A Go Go in West Hollywood on February 11, 1992. Background and recording Ask for It featured songs recorded from several different sources; only one song on the EP was a studio recording, while the rest were from live performances with John Peel and at the Whisky A Go Go.
