Twisted Logic Tour
The Twisted Logic Tour was a global concert tour by British alternative rock band Coldplay in support of their third studio album, X&Y (2005). The year-long tour took the band across Europe and their native United Kingdom, as well as to the United States and Canada. The main legs of the tour concluded in July 2006 after shows in Asia & Australia, with the band resting for a lengthy period of time, and beginning production of their fourth studio album Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends in November. In the beginning of 2007, a final leg in Latin America concluded the tour entirely in March, after about a dozen shows. Pollstar reported that the 2005 North American leg grossed an estimated $24.1 million. The second leg of the North American tour ended 6 April 2006 at the Wachovia Center in Philadelphia. This is Coldplay's first (and their only to date) tour not named after the album it was promoting; the tour is named after a song on X&Y that has never been played live at any of the concerts.
