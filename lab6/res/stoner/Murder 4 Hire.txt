Murder 4 Hire
Murder 4 Hire is the fourth studio album by American heavy metal band Body Count. Released on August 1, 2006, this was the first album from Body Count in nine years. Work on the album had come to a pause after rhythm guitarist D-Roc the Executioner was found dead in his apartment due to his lymphoma cancer in 2004. Once the band acquired Bendrix as their new rhythm guitarist, work on the album resumed and the album was released two years later. Frontman Ice-T later told Esquire Magazine he wasn't satisfied with the way the album came out because he wasn't as involved in the project as he usually tries to be. "I kinda mailed it in. They wrote the music in L.A. and sent me the tracks, I wrote the lyrics, and I just kinda walked away. I didn't mix it, I didn't do anything to it, and the record suffered."
