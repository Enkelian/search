History The airline was established in August 2013 and was granted approval by the South African Air Service Licensing Council to launch operations with ten daily services between Johannesburg's OR Tambo International Airport and Cape Town International Airport. The airline had plans to begin operations in October 2013. However, on 8 October 2013, the High Court of South Africa granted an interim court order preventing the airline from starting operations, following an application by rival carriers, on the basis that it did not meet the legal requirement of 75% local ownership. Substantial restructuring of ownership took place and FlySafair's inaugural flight eventually took place on 16 October 2014.On 29 March 2017, the airline announced its new partnership with the South African Rugby Union (SARU) making it the official domestic carrier for the Springboks and SA Rugby.
