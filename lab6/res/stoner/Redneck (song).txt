Redneck (song)
"Redneck" is the first single from the heavy metal band Lamb of God, from their fifth album Sacrament. A music video was also produced for the song. Vocalist Randy Blythe described the song's meaning in an interview with the magazine Metal Hammer: "Generally, it's not about any one person in particular. It's about people in the music industry whose egos become needlessly inflated and they show it. It's a general song. It's applicable to anyone in their life. If a fan thinks, 'Oh, well, this guy is a prick,' go ahead and take it and make it yours."The song was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance at the Grammy Awards of 2007. It appeared as Brian Posehn's introductory song on the Comedy Central "Roast of Bob Saget" and is featured on the track listing of THQ's Saints Row 2, EA Sports Big's NFL Street 3 and SCEA's ATV Offroad Fury 4 video games. Music video The music video begins with a little girl named Mary Jane, whose birthday is near: her mother decides that this year instead of her father playing music, they should "hire some professional entertainment" and looks at the yellow pages for a band.
