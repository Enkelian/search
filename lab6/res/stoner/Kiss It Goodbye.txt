Kiss It Goodbye
Kiss it Goodbye was a hardcore band from Seattle, Washington, United States that formed in 1996 and broke-up in 1998. History After leaving the New Jersey band Deadguy in 1996, vocalist Tim Singer and guitarist Keith Huckins moved on to form Kiss it Goodbye with bassist Thom Rusnack and drummer Andrew Gormley. Huckins, Rusnack and Gormley were already familiar musically as they had all previously performed together in the New Jersey band Rorschach. A demo tape titled Be Afraid was quickly recorded and heavily circulated around the New York City area which responded with high praise. The demo is the only recording made by the group to feature guitarist Eric Cooper. The band recorded their 1997 debut LP She Loves Me, She Loves Me Not for Revelation Records. Produced by Billy Anderson, the album had the same familiar sound that fans of Deadguy and Rorschach had come to know along with Singer's melodramatic screams and ramblings. The tracks "Preacher" and "Target Practice" which were omitted from She Loves Me, She Loves Me Not were also released this same year as a 7" EP through Revelation.In 1997, the band toured with Unsane. They also toured with death metal outfit Obituary. Shortly
