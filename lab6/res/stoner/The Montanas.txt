The Montanas
The Montanas were an English 1960s and 1970s pop rock band from Wolverhampton, England. Though they never found significant success in their home country, they had one moderate hit in the United States. The group formed in 1964 and became known for their live shows. Their manager, Roger Allen, had them signed to Pye Records, and some of their early releases for Pye were written by Tony Hatch and Jackie Trent. In 1966 Terry Rowley joined the group on keyboards, and also worked with the group on composition and arranging. They released two singles in the year, the second, "That's When Happiness Began" b/w "Goodbye Little Girl", of which became a steady seller in the autumn of 1966 when it received extensive radio play. The band's breakthrough came later in the year when they became the opening act for the Walker Brothers tour across the UK, concluding in November 1966. More singles followed, and the band appeared on radio programmes like Easy Beat and Saturday Club, and touring expanded to other countries including France, the Netherlands, and Germany. One single in particular, "Ciao Baby" b/w "Anyone There", was released in March 1967, and sold over 10,000 copies in Britain alone.
