Soft Machine
Soft Machine are an English rock band from Canterbury formed in mid-1966, currently consisting of John Marshall (drums), Roy Babbington (bass), John Etheridge (guitar), and Theo Travis (saxophone, flutes, keyboards). As a central band of the Canterbury scene, the group became one of the first British psychedelic acts and later moved into progressive and jazz-rock. Their varying lineups have included prominent former members such as Mike Ratledge (organ, 1966–76), Robert Wyatt (drums & vocals, 1966–71), Kevin Ayers (bass, guitar & vocals, 1966–68), and Hugh Hopper (bass, 1969–73). Though they achieved little commercial success, the Soft Machine are considered by critics to have been influential in rock music, Dave Lynch at AllMusic called them "one of the more influential bands of their era, and certainly one of the most influential underground ones". The group were named after the novel The Soft Machine by William S. Burroughs.
