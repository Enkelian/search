Roots revival
A roots revival (folk revival) is a trend which includes young performers popularizing the traditional musical styles of their ancestors. Often, roots revivals include an addition of newly composed songs with socially and politically aware lyrics, as well as a general modernization of the folk sound. The term roots revival is vague, and may not always refer to identical events. Characteristics associated with a roots revival include: Popularization of previously non-mainstream folk music Adaptation of folk styles to pop (or rock) structures Invention of new formats like bands where only solo acts had existed before Introduction of new instruments Composition of works by those who perform them, as opposed to folk tunes mostly passed down orally (see singer-songwriter) Incorporation of politically aware lyrics, often critical of a government, religion or other authority, or society in general. Lyrics are the first from the nation to express more than simple desires and problems, and are often seen as the embodiment of a national character or literary tradition (in comparison to the legendary American songwriter, such composers are often said to be the "Bob Dylan" of a particular variety, as in Wannes Van de Velde is the Belgian Bob Dylan) Roots revival performers
