Boimorto is a municipality in the province of A Coruña in the autonomous community of Galicia in northwestern Spain. It is located in the comarca of Arzúa. It has an area of 82.71 km2, a population of 2,486 (2004 estimate), and a population density of 30.06 people/km2. Coordinates: 43° 00' 27" N - 8° 07' 37" W. Elevation: 487 m. Place Names According to Gonzalo Ramón Navaza Blanco, professor of literature at the University of Vigo, the place name could have its origin in the word bado, which would designate a step not currently used. Another possibility is that Boi refers to rocks, since it appears in several place-names with that meaning, and it has a similar meaning and refers to a site with abundant stones. This last thesis is supported by Fernando Cabeza Quiles, who claims that it could come from the Celtic voice, referring this Celtic voice to a rocky place.
