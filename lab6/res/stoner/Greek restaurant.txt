Greek restaurant
A Greek restaurant is a restaurant that specializes in Greek cuisine. In the United States they tend to be a different affair, varying in types of service, cuisine, menu offerings, table settings, and seating arrangements. Their menu may also feature dishes from other cuisines. By type Estiatório The estiatório (plural estiatória) is a type of modest restaurant in Greece. It has been described as "something of a vanishing breed." This form of eatery was more active during the early 1900s. An estiatório serves dishes such as casseroles, meat and game stews, baked meat and fish, macaroni pie, and mayirefta in the form of moussaka. Estiatória serve dishes cooked in the oven called magerefta. In addition, they can have grilled-to-order foods called tis oras, fish, appetizers (mezedes), and salads.

In Greece, gyros are typically prepared using spiced ground pork shoulder meat on a pita with tzatziki sauce, while in the United States, they are commonly prepared with ground lamb sliced from a vertical rotisserie spit.
