History Several newspapers were published weekly in Bundaberg between 1880 and 1900, with two tri-weeklies, The Star and The Mail settling the market in the early 20th century. A third newspaper, the Daily News, was launched in 1907 amid local political rivalries. In 1908, the Bundaberg Star was incorporated with the Bundaberg Daily News and, in 1925, the Bundaberg Daily News and The Mail merged to become the Bundaberg News and Mail. In 1942, the abbreviated NewsMail masthead replaced the original name. See also List of newspapers in Australia References External links NewsMail
