The project's failure was in part blamed on the below-ground works needed to fill and stabilise many historic mine working excavations. The anticipated completion date for phase-one involving the circuit and infrastructure buildings was 2019. The 163 acres (66 ha) site is situated on disused clay pits, previously providing raw materials for brick production, in an area traditionally known for coal mining. Initial groundworks were formally opened in September 2017, attended by Francie Molloy, MP for Mid-Ulster, unlike the continually stalled Circuit of Wales which has seen no actual development.
