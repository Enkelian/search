Chipmunk Punk
Chipmunk Punk is an album by the Chipmunks, as well as being the first album released by Ross Bagdasarian, Jr., after he took over the voices of the Chipmunks after the death of his father in 1972. Despite the title of the album, none of the songs listed are considered to be in the style of real punk rock music. It was released on June 15, 1980 (see 1980 in music). The album peaked at #34 on the Billboard 200. It was certified gold by the RIAA on October 14, 1980, becoming the Chipmunks' first gold record. In 2005, it was re-released on CD, although the CD was only available through the official Chipmunks website. History The inspiration for the album came when KMET DJ Chuck Taylor played the 12" version of the Blondie song "Call Me" at double speed and announced, in jest, that it was the Chipmunks' latest single. So many requests came for this "new" Chipmunks release, that Ross Bagdasarian Jr. and his collaborator Steve Vining rushed to record this album. In addition to "Call Me," the album featured covers of songs by The Knack ("My Sharona," "Good Girls Don't," "Frustrated"), The Cars ("Let's Go"), Tom Petty
