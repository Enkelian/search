History Damnation A.D. formed under the name "Damnation" in 1992 by two veterans of the D.C. straight edge hardcore punk scene, songwriter/guitarist Ken Olden and vocalist Mike McTernan (who is the brother of producer Brian McTernan).

The group split up shortly after, with Olden moving into recording and also working with Ray Cappo in Better Than a Thousand. Mike McTernan moved to Springfield, MA and sang
