The Psychomodo
The Psychomodo is the second studio album by Cockney Rebel, released in 1974. It was produced by Steve Harley and Alan Parsons. Background Having signed a three-album deal with EMI Records in late 1972, Cockney Rebel released their debut album The Human Menagerie in November 1973. The album, and its single "Sebastian", both failed to enter the UK charts, although the single was a hit in Continental Europe. The lack of success in the UK led EMI to feel that Harley had yet to record a potential hit single. In response, he went away and re-worked his unrecorded song "Judy Teen", which was released in March 1974 and became a UK Top 5 hit.When "Judy Teen" was released and began climbing the charts, the band had already started recording their second album The Psychomodo. It was recorded during February and March 1974, at Morgan Studios, Nova Sound Studios and AIR Studios in London. It was mastered at Abbey Road Studios. On the album, Harley received his first production credit, producing alongside Alan Parsons. In similarity to the band's debut album, a large symphony orchestra and choir was used on certain tracks with orchestral arrangements again conducted by Andrew Powell. In
