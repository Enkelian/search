Gadolinium(III) chloride
Gadolinium(III) chloride, also known as gadolinium trichloride, is GdCl3. It is a colorless, hygroscopic, water-soluble solid. The hexahydrate GdCl3∙6H2O is commonly encountered and is sometimes also called gadolinium trichloride. Gd3+ species are of special interest because the ion has the maximum number of unpaired spins possible, at least for known elements. With seven valence electrons and seven available f-orbitals, all seven electrons are unpaired and symmetrically arranged around the metal. The high magnetism and high symmetry combine to make Gd3+ a useful component in NMR spectroscopy and MRI. Preparation GdCl3 is usually prepared by the "ammonium chloride" route, which involves the initial synthesis of (NH4)2[GdCl5]. This material can be prepared from the common starting materials at reaction temperatures of 230 °C from gadolinium oxide: 10 NH4Cl + Gd2O3 → 2 (NH4)2[GdCl5] + 6 NH3 + 3 H2Ofrom hydrated gadolinium chloride: 4 NH4Cl + 2 GdCl3∙6H2O → 2 (NH4)2[GdCl5] + 12 H2Ofrom gadolinium metal: 10 NH4Cl + 2 Gd → 2 (NH4)2[GdCl5] + 6 NH3 + 3 H2In the second step the pentachloride is decomposed at 300 °C: (NH4)2[GdCl5] → GdCl3 + 2 NH4ClThis pyrolysis reaction proceeds via the intermediacy of NH4[Gd2Cl7]. The ammonium chloride route is more popular and less
