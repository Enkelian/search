The New Bomb Turks are an American punk rock band formed at the Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio, United States, in 1990. The founding members are Jim Weber, Eric Davidson, Bill Randt, and Matt Reber. Sam Brown replaced Bill Randt on drums in 1999. Early on their inspiration came from the Devil Dogs, Lazy Cowgirls, Union Carbide Productions, Didjits, and the Fluid. Music magazine Alternative Press has described their musical style, saying, "Not only have both prole-threat punk bashery and destructo-rock found fresh voices, they've been melded into a seamless new terror all its own." The New Bomb Turks have released ten full-length LPs, two EPs, and over twenty singles, some of which contain songs not available elsewhere. Their early recordings appear on the Datapanik, Sympathy For The Record Industry, Get Hip and Bag of Hammers labels. Crypt Records signed the band and released !!Destroy-Oh-Boy!!, Information Highway Revisited, and Pissing Out The Poison. Then Epitaph Records signed them and released LPs Scared Straight, At Rope's End and Nightmare Scenario. Gearhead Records released their next album, The Night Before the Day the Earth Stood Still. The band also released three b-side and outtakes compilations: Pissing Out the Poison, The Big
