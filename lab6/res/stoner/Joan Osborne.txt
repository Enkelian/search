Osborne was paying her own way through college and taking time off to earn money for another semester when by chance she sang at an open mic night at the Abilene Caf√©. The other musicians encouraged her to return, and she began singing weekly at the Abilene's open mic and at other blues open mics in NYC's East Village.
