It is widely regarded as a concept album featuring a central theme of "the distinction between religion and God", though the band have said there was no intention to make a concept album, and that only a few songs have a unifying theme.

Aqualung's success signalled a turning point in the career of the band, which went on to become a major radio and touring act.
