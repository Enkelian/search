Metric system
A metric system is any one of the systems of measurement that succeeded the decimalised metre-based system introduced into France in the 1790s. The most recent such system is the internationally recognised International System of Units (SI). Metric systems have developed to comply with the following basic concepts. There should be a single base unit of measure for quantities of each of the fundamental dimensions of nature (e.g. the metre is the base unit for length). To measure quantities derived from the fundamental dimensions, units derived from the base units should be used (e.g. the square metre is the derived unit for area, a quantity derived from length). For the sake of universality, the base unit standards should be realisable anywhere from natural phenomena, rather than having to be copied from a single centralised standard physical artefact. A set of standard prefixes should be used to define units which are decimal multiples and sub-multiples of the base and derived units. No conversion factors should be required to convert between units, thus ensuring coherence. Metric systems have evolved since the 1790s as science and technology has evolved, to provide a single universal measuring system which can be used for all measurement
