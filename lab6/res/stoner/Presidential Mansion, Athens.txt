The Presidential Mansion (Greek: Προεδρικό Μέγαρο, romanized: Proedrikό Mégaro) in Athens, Greece, is the official residence of the President of the Hellenic Republic. It served previously as the Royal Palace (often known as the New Royal Palace), until the abolition of the monarchy by the 1973 referendum. History The decision to construct the building which currently is used as the Presidential Mansion was made in 1868. That year, King George I's son, Constantine, the heir to the throne, was born and the Greek state decided to present him with a private dwelling, when he came of age.

On Christmas Eve, 1909, a fire destroyed a large part of the Royal Palace (now used by Parliament), with the result that the Crown Prince's Palace was used temporarily as the residence of the royal family. After the assassination of George I in 1913 and the accession of Constantine to the throne, the Crown Prince's Palace finally became the main royal residence of
