Battle of Adwa
The Battle of Adwa (Tigrinya: ዓድዋ; Amharic: አድዋ; Italian Adua) was the climactic battle of the First Italo-Ethiopian War. The Ethiopian forces, who had high numerical superiority, better equipment and support by Russia and France, defeated an outnumbered and less-equipped Italian invading force on Sunday 1 March 1896, near the town of Adwa. The decisive victory thwarted the campaign of the Kingdom of Italy (a newly unified state and a relative newcomer to the imperialist scramble for Africa) to expand its colonial empire in the Horn of Africa. By the end of the 19th century, European powers had carved up almost all of Africa after the Berlin Conference; only Ethiopia, the Republic of Liberia and the Dervish State still maintained their independence. Though not the first African nation to resist European conquest, it became a pre-eminent symbol of pan-Africanism and secured the Ethiopia's sovereignty for another forty years. Background In 1889, the Italians signed the Treaty of Wuchale with then Negus Menelik of Shewa. The treaty ceded territories previously part of Ethiopia, namely the provinces of Bogos, Hamasien, Akele Guzai, Serae, and parts of Tigray. In return, Italy promised Menelik II continued rule, financial assistance and military supplies. A dispute
