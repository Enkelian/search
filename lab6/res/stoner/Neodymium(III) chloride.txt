Neodymium(III) chloride
Neodymium(III) chloride or neodymium trichloride is a chemical compound of neodymium and chlorine with the formula NdCl3. This anhydrous compound is a mauve-colored solid that rapidly absorbs water on exposure to air to form a purple-colored hexahydrate, NdCl3·6H2O. Neodymium(III) chloride is produced from minerals monazite and bastnäsite using a complex multistage extraction process. The chloride has several important applications as an intermediate chemical for production of neodymium metal and neodymium-based lasers and optical fibers. Other applications include a catalyst in organic synthesis and in decomposition of waste water contamination, corrosion protection of aluminium and its alloys, and fluorescent labeling of organic molecules (DNA). Appearance NdCl3 is a mauve colored hygroscopic solid whose color changes to purple upon absorption of atmospheric water. The resulting hydrate, like many other neodymium salts, has the interesting property that it appears different colors under fluorescent light- In the chloride's case, light yellow (see picture). Structure Solid The anhydrous NdCl3 features Nd in a nine-coordinate tricapped trigonal prismatic geometry and crystallizes with the UCl3 structure. This hexagonal structure is common for many halogenated lanthanides and actinides such as LaCl3, LaBr3, SmCl3, PrCl3, EuCl3, CeCl3, CeBr3, GdCl3, AmCl3 and TbCl3 but not for YbCl3 and LuCl3. Solution
