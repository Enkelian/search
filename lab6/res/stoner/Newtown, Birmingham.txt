Newtown, Birmingham
Newtown, also referred to as Aston New Town, is an inner city area of Birmingham, England, just to the north of the city centre. Newtown is centred on the A34 road, locally named New Town Row which runs from Birmingham City Centre through north-west Birmingham into Walsall; and part of the A4540 which is the ring-road around the centre of the city. Newtown is bordered by a number of other areas such as the Jewellery Quarter, the Gun Quarter and the University of Aston. West is Hockley and the Hockley Flyover, to the north west is Lozells and to the north east is Aston. Newtown was a large project in the Aston area of Birmingham, England to construct 16 tower blocks. It was approved in 1968. As of April 2007, five of these tower blocks have been demolished and refurbishment work commenced on Manton and Reynolds House in 2011 as part of a wider initiative to regenerate Newtown. It will see the clearance of council houses around Alma Way and the construction of modern homes with a new youth centre. Loosely related to the initiative was the reconstruction of the Holte and Lozells Schools. Existing tower blocks Hodgson Tower Baldwin
