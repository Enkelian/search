Crazy Tour
Crazy Tour was a short tour by the British rock band Queen during November and December 1979. After the release of the single "Crazy Little Thing Called Love", the band decided to change the concert dynamic they used to do the last years. In this tour Queen would revisit smaller venues, many which held fewer than two thousand seats. Nonetheless, it was the highly awaited UK leg of the successful Jazz Tour. The last concert of this tour at the Hammersmith Odeon was also the first concert of the Concerts for the People of Kampuchea. A bootleg recording of this concert exists as the 2-CD set Crazy Tour of London.The Crazy Tour is praised by fans as one of Queen's best tours. Freddie Mercury's vocals have recovered from the wear of the previous tour and are possibly the greatest they have ever been on stage. Because Mercury is in great form during this run of concerts, he is very experimental and isn't afraid to try daring high notes, some of which he had never tried in a live setting before, such as the C5's in "Somebody To Love," "Bohemian Rhapsody," or "We Are The Champions."Five concerts from the Crazy Tour
