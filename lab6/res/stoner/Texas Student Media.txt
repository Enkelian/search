Texas Student Media (TSM) is an auxiliary enterprise of the University of Texas at Austin (UT) and the largest student media operation in the United States.

In 1902, the Student Association was formed, partly to oversee UT student publications. In 1921, as more publications emerged, Texas Student Publications, Inc. (TSP) was formed. Over the years the organization oversaw a number of UT publications: On Campus The Coyote (1908 – 1915) — humor magazine banned by the Student Association Longhorn Magazine (1915 – 1929) — literary journal merged with The Texas Ranger The Scalper (Oct. 1919 – Nov. 1922) — humor magazine banned by the TSP for its perceived "immorality" The Texas Ranger (Oct. 1923 – Jan. 1972) — humor magazine; a number of staffers (from the period 1959–1965) later went on to become key members of the underground comix scene The Peregrinus (1949 – 2004) — University of Texas School of Law yearbook (named after Praetor Peregrinus, the patron saint of law students);
