Fissure
In anatomy, a fissure (Latin fissura, plural fissurae) is a groove, natural division, deep furrow, elongated cleft, or tear in various parts of the body also generally called a sulcus, or in the brain a sulcus. Types Brain Broca's fissure: found in the third left frontal fold of the brain. Burdach's fissure: connects the brain's insula and the inner surface of the operculum. Calcarin's fissure: extends from the occipital of the cerebrum to the occipital fissure. Callosomarginal fissure: found in the medial surface of the cerebrum. Central sulcus or Rolando's fissure: separates the brain's frontal and parietal lobes. Clevenger's fissure: found in the inferior temporal lobe of the brain Collateral fissure: found in the inferior surface of the cerebrum. Fissure of Bichat: found below the corpus callosum in the cerebellum of the brain. Fissure of Sylvius: separates the frontal and parietal lobes of the brain from the temporal lobe. Hippocampal sulcus: a sulcus that extends from the brain's corpus callosum to the tip of the temporal lobe. Horizontal fissure or Transverse fissure: found between the cerebrum and the cerebellum. Note that a "transverse fissure" can also be found in the liver and lungs. Medial longitudinal fissure or Longitudinal fissure: which
