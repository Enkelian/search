Open E tuning
Open E tuning is a tuning for guitar: low to high, E-B-E-Gâ™¯-B-E. Compared to standard tuning, two strings are two semitones higher and one string is one semitone higher. The intervals are identical to those found in open D tuning. In fact, it is common for players to keep their guitar tuned to open d and place a capo over the second fret. This use of a capo allows for quickly changing between open d and open e without having to manipulate the guitar's tuning pegs.Familiar examples of Open E tuning include the distinctive song "Bo Diddley" by Bo Diddley, the beginning guitar part on the song "Jumpin' Jack Flash" the rhythm guitar on "Gimme Shelter" by The Rolling Stones, as well as their distinctly earthy blues song "Prodigal Son" from the Beggars Banquet album, originally by Robert Wilkins. The whole of Bob Dylan's "Blood on the Tracks" album was recorded in open E tuning, although some of the songs have been re-recorded in standard tuning prior to the album's release. The tuning is also used in The Black Crowes' "She Talks to Angels", Glen Hansard's "Say It To Me Now", Joe Walsh's "Rocky Mountain Way", Rush's "Headlong Flight", Dave
