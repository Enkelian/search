He has written numerous poems, stories, and novels. He has also translated several books into Icelandic, including Alice in Wonderland.

His best-known work internationally is the novel Brotahöfuð ("The Blue Tower"), which was nominated for an International Dublin Literary Award in 2001. Locally he is well known and respected for his short stories (most often offering humorous social satire), and his equally humorous and witty poetry, such as his "Disney Rhymes" (1974) - The Walt Disney Story presented as an epic tale in the rímur fashion. In 2008, the Icelandic publishing house Vaka-Helgafell, released the entire collection of his poetry which instantly became a best seller. He has five sons: Úlfur Eldjárn, the comedian Ari Eldjárn, Halldór Eldjárn of the band Sykur,
