Port San Antonio
The Port Authority of San Antonio (doing business as Port San Antonio) is a public entity created to redevelop the site of the former Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas.The site's 1,900-acre (7.7 square kilometer) campus is the single-largest commercial/industrial property in Bexar County and serves as a vital technology and innovation epicenter for the region. Over 80 tenant customers employ around 14,000 people on the Port's unique air-, rail- and highway-served property - generating approximately $5.6 billion in annual economic activity for the region. A number of the public- and private-sector tenant customers lease facilities (both former Air Force and newly-built spaces) from the Port. Port San Antonio's customers are principally engaged in advanced technology, aerospace and aircraft maintenance and completion (for both military and commercial/private aircraft), IT/cybersecurity, Department of Defense, logistics and manufacturing activities. The Port is regarded as a notable example of base redevelopment. In 2010 it was named Base Redevelopment Community of the Year by the Association of Defense Communitiesâ€”a Washington, D.C.- based group that supports the transition of former military facilities to serve other public and commercial uses. Additionally, Port San Antonio was named the region's Business of the Year for 2019 by
