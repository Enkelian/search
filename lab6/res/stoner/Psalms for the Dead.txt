Psalms for the Dead
Psalms for the Dead is the eleventh studio album by the Swedish doom metal band Candlemass, released on 8 June 2012. At the time of its release, the band stated that this would be their final album, though bassist and founding member Leif Edling has since retracted this claim. Psalms for the Dead is, however, the last Candlemass album recorded with singer Robert Lowe, who left the band just six days before its release.As like as the two previous albums, Psalms for the Dead received rave reviews from both music critics and band fans upon release. The album would become Candlemass' last full-length release in over half a decade, until the 2019 release of their twelfth studio album The Door to Doom; during those seven years, however, the band released two EPs featuring new material: Death Thy Lover (2016) and House of Doom (2018).
