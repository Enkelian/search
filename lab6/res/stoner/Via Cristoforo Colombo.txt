Via Cristoforo Colombo
Via Cristoforo Colombo (or just la Colombo, as it is often called by the Romans; Italian pronunciation: [kriˈstɔːforo koˈlombo]) is a street in Rome (Italy) that links the historic centre to Ostia. Along most of its route, the street has three lanes for each direction of movement. With its 27 kilometres (17 mi) length it is the longest Italian road among those included within the borders of a single municipality and, in several stretches, the largest in Italy. Via Cristoforo Colombo starts from Porta Ardeatina and continues south-west, ending on the coast in the district of Castel Fusano.
