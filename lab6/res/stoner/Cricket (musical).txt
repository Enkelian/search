Cricket (musical)
Cricket, also called Cricket (Hearts and Wickets), is a short musical written by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice. It was commissioned for Queen Elizabeth's 60th birthday celebration, and was first performed at Windsor Castle on 18 June 1986. Several of the tunes from the show were later used for Aspects of Love, so the work was dropped from public performance or recording. Cricket was the last original musical Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber wrote together. History After their collaboration on Evita in 1978, composer Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyricist Tim Rice took what was originally intended to be a temporary break from their theatrical partnership. They did not work together again until the request for this pièce d'occasion came up, and Cricket ended up being their final original musical. Prince Edward, the Queen's youngest son, commissioned a short musical from Lloyd Webber and Rice for his mother's 60th birthday celebration. The game of cricket was Tim Rice's favourite pastime – he had a cricket field on the grounds of his home and had his own cricket team – and Rice had a particular passion for this new comic musical about England's national sport. Rice used actual cricket-related names
