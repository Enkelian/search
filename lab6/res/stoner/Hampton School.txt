Hampton School
Hampton School (formerly Hampton Grammar School) is an independent boys' day school in Hampton, Greater London, England. History In 1557, Robert Hammond, a wealthy brewer who had acquired property in Hampton, left in his will provision for the maintenance of a "free scole" and to build a small schoolhouse "with seates in yt" in the churchyard of Hampton Church . Although Hampton School was founded in 1557, there was provision in the will that the school would only continue as long as the vicar, churchwardens and parishioners carried out his requests. If not, then the properties would revert to his heirs. It seems that the school did not survive beyond 1568, or possibly earlier, and the properties reverted to the heirs. Subsequently, however, the school re-opened in 1612. This was as a result of a Commission established to enquire into the fate of Tudor charities that had disappeared for various reasons. The "learned counsell on bothe sides" reached deadlock at the Commissioners. However, in the spirit of compromise and through the generosity of the then legal owner of the properties, Nicholas Pigeon, the school was re-endowed. The early school was on the site of St Mary's Church by the River
