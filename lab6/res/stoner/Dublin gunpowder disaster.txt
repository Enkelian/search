Dublin gunpowder disaster
The Dublin gunpowder disaster was a large explosion that took place on the quays of Dublin on 11 March 1597. The explosion demolished as many as forty houses, and left dozens of others badly damaged. The disaster claimed the lives of 126 people and inflicted countless injuries.The accidental explosion is the worst disaster of the kind to have occurred in Ireland. In the long run, however, the disaster provided the impetus for the expansion of Dublin in the early 17th Century and beyond, with the rebuilding efforts laying the foundation of the new city centre. Explosion of 11 March In the early afternoon of Friday, 11 March 1597, a consignment of gunpowder barrels was being unloaded by crane from a lighter (a barge) moored at the dock close to Wood Quay. Shortly after one o'clock, as the wooden crane was shifting four barrels of gunpowder towards the quay, 140 barrels of gunpowder that had been resting on the river side were engulfed by a massive explosion, transforming the quayside into a scene of devastation. The crane and crane house, which were sited by the barrels, were torn asunder, and the force of the blast was felt far across the city.
