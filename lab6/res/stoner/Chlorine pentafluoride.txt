Chlorine pentafluoride
Chlorine pentafluoride is an interhalogen compound with formula ClF5. This colourless gas is a strong oxidant that was once a candidate oxidizer for rockets. The molecule adopts a square pyramidal structure with C4v symmetry, as confirmed by its high-resolution 19F NMR spectrum. Preparation Some of the earliest research on the preparation was classified. It was first prepared by fluorination of chlorine trifluoride at high temperatures and high pressures: ClF3 + F2 → ClF5 ClF + 2F2 → ClF5 Cl2 + 5F2 → 2ClF5 CsClF4 + F2 → CsF + ClF5NiF2 catalyzes this reaction.Certain metal fluorides, MClF4 (i.e. KClF4, RbClF4, CsClF4), react with F2 to produce ClF5 and the corresponding alkali metal fluoride. Reactions In a highly exothermic reaction, ClF5 reacts with water to produce chloryl fluoride and hydrogen fluoride: ClF5 + 2 H2O → ClO2F + 4 HFIt is also a strong fluorinating agent. At room temperature it reacts readily with all elements (including otherwise "inert" elements like platinum and gold) except noble gases, nitrogen, oxygen and fluorine.
