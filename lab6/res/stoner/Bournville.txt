Bournville
Bournville () is a model village on the south side of Birmingham, England, best known for its connections with the Cadbury family and chocolate â€“ including a dark chocolate bar branded Bournville. Historically in northern Worcestershire, it is also a ward within the council constituency of Selly Oak and home to the Bournville Centre for Visual Arts. Research by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation in 2003 found that it was "one of the nicest places to live in Britain". History Originally the area that was to become Bournville consisted of a few scattered farmsteads and cottages, linked by winding country lanes, with the only visual highlight being the Georgian built Bournbrook Hall. The bluebell glades of Stock Wood were said to be a relic of the Forest of Arden and there are Roman remains nearby. Though Selly Manor and Minworth Greaves date back to the 14th century or earlier, they were each moved to Bournville in the 20th century, and are operated as a museum. Cadbury Having taken over their father John Cadbury's expanding business in 1861, the Quakers George and Richard Cadbury needed to move their cocoa and chocolate factory from Bridge Street in central Birmingham to a greenfield site
