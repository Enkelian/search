Scandium chloride
Scandium(III) chloride is the inorganic compound with the formula ScCl3. It is a white, high-melting ionic compound, which is deliquescent and highly water-soluble. Scandium(III) chloride is mainly of interest in the research laboratory. Both the anhydrous form and hexahydrate (ScCl3•6H2O) are commercially available. Structure ScCl3 crystallises in the layered BiI3 motif, which features octahedral scandium centres. Monomeric ScCl3 is the predominant species in the vapour phase at 900 K, the dimer Sc2Cl6 accounts for approximately 8%. The electron diffraction spectrum indicates that the monomer is planar and the dimer has two bridging Cl atoms each Sc being 4 coordinate. Reactions ScCl3 dissolves in water to give [Sc(H2O)6]3+ ions. In fact, samples of ScCl3 converts to this hexahydrate upon exposure to air. The structure of the hexahydrate is trans-[ScCl2(H2O)4]Cl·2H2O. With the less basic ligand tetrahydrofuran, ScCl3 yields the adduct ScCl3(THF)3 as white crystals. This THF-soluble complex is used in the synthesis of organoscandium compounds. ScCl3 has been converted to its dodecyl sulfate salt, which has been investigated as a "Lewis acid-surfactant combined catalyst" (LASC) in aldol-like reactions. Reduction Scandium(III) chloride was used by Fischer et al. who first prepared metallic scandium by electrolysis of a eutectic melt of scandium(III) chloride and
