Music of Namibia
The music of Namibia includes a number of folk styles, as well as pop, rock, reggae, jazz, house and hip hop. The Sanlam-NBC Music Awards and the Namibian Music Awards are two separate institutions that give out annual awards at shows on December 2 and May 6 respectively.[2] The Namibia Society of Composers and Authors of Music (NASCAM) has helped promote Namibian music within and outside the country. The Namibian music industry remains under-developed, with no major record labels or distribution infrastructure.[3] A lack of focus to produce economically viable Namibian music products and the absence of effective marketing and distribution structures are two of the factors inherently hampering the development of the local music industry. The country's biggest online music retailer, DONLU offers streaming services. They also boast being the only online music store in Africa that allows for purchases of music to be done and being paid for by various mobile money wallets across Africa in Tanzania, Rwanda, Kenya, Uganda and Zambia. Payments can be done with MTN Money, Vodacom Money, Airtel and Tigo Pesa for the fans living in those African countries. Fans living in the rest of the world, can pay using PayPal, PayToday as well
