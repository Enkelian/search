Charles Washington
Charles Washington (May 2, 1738 – September 16, 1799) was the youngest brother of United States President George Washington. He was a son of Augustine Washington and his second wife, Mary Ball Washington. Biography Charles was born at Hunting Creek in Stafford County, Virginia (now Fairfax County). He married Mildred Thornton, daughter of Colonel Francis Thornton and Frances Gregory in 1757. They had four children and resided in Fredericksburg, Virginia. He arrived in present Jefferson County, West Virginia, between April and October 1780 and founded Charles Town. There he erected a house, Happy Retreat, the same year. In 1786, on 80 acres (323,750 m²) of his adjoining land, Charles laid out the streets of Charles Town, naming many of them after his brothers and one after his wife, Mildred. He donated the four corner lots at the intersection of George and Washington Streets for public buildings of the town and county, provided the town become the seat of the county upon its separation from Berkeley County. Jefferson County was formed in 1801 as Charles anticipated. The county court house stands on one of these lots. Charles died sometime between July and September, 1799, only a short while before the death
