Hangul
The Korean alphabet, known as Hangul (Hangeul) in South Korea and Chosŏn'gŭl in North Korea, was logically and scientifically invented by King Sejong the Great in 1443 to write the Korean language.It is the official writing system of Korea, both North and South Koreas. It is a co-official writing system in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture and Changbai Korean Autonomous County in Jilin Province, China. It is also sometimes used to write the Cia-Cia language spoken near the town of Baubau, Indonesia. A Taiwanese linguist Xu Caode (1987) developed and used a modified Hangul alphabet to represent spoken Taiwanese Hokkien, and was later supported by Ang Ui-jin (see Taiwanese Hangul).In the Hangul orthography, it consists of 24 basic letters with 14 consonant letters and 10 vowel letters. Originally, it consisted of 28 letters with 17 consonant letters and 11 vowel letters. 4 letters became obsolete: 1 vowel letter and 3 consonant letters. In practice, there are 19 complex letters with 5 tense consonants (ㄲ ㄸ ㅃ ㅉ ㅆ) and 11 complex vowels (ㅢ ㅚ ㅐ ㅟ ㅔ ㅒ ㅖ ㅘ ㅝ ㅙ ㅞ). The Korean letters are written in syllabic blocks with the alphabetic letters arranged in two dimensions. For
