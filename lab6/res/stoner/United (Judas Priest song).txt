United (Judas Priest song)
"United" is the fifth track and last single to be released from the album British Steel by heavy metal group Judas Priest. The song was written very much in the same vein as "Take On the World" from Killing Machine (Hell Bent for Leather in the U.S.) and meant to be a crowd shout-along. It is the fifth track and final song on the first side on the LP version. The single, with "Grinder" on the B-side, peaked at number 26 on the UK Singles Chart and spent a total of eight weeks on the chart. The crowd noise on the live version was enhanced by dub overlay using family members and friends. Personnel Rob Halford – vocals K. K.
