1892 Brooklyn Grooms season
The 1892 Brooklyn Grooms season was a season in American baseball. The team finished the first half of the split season in second place, just 2.5 games behind the Boston Beaneaters. However, they faded in the second half, finishing 9.5 games behind the second-half champion Cleveland Spiders and missing out on the postseason playoff. Their combined record was 95â€“59, third best overall in the league. The season was a tragic one, as outfielder Hub Collins left a game on May 14 because he was feeling ill. A week later he was dead, the victim of typhoid fever. The team put on a benefit game to raise money for his widow on May 29. One bright spot, however, was first baseman Dan Brouthers, who won the batting title with a .335 average.
