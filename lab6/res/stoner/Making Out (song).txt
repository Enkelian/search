Making Out (song)
"Making Out" is a song by American band No Doubt for their fifth studio album, Rock Steady (2001). In the Philippines, the song was released as a promotional single and distributed in limited quantities on CDs through Interscope Records. Produced by the band and William Orbit, "Making Out" was written by members Gwen Stefani, Tony Kanal, and Tom Dumont. While recording Rock Steady, the group aimed to work with a variety of musicians during sessions, unlike the processes they had endured for previous albums. Upon working with Orbit, they created a new wave and synth-pop song, with nods to electronic and Europop music. The lyrics find Stefani discussing her then-relationship with British singer Gavin Rossdale. She expresses a strong distaste for long-distance relationships and yearns for her lover to return home. Critically, "Making Out" drew a mostly negative response from music journalists. It was deemed overproduced and criticized for overly generic lyrics. Some reviewers, however, favorited it for being catchy and lyrically personal. Critics made comparisons between "Making Out" and Stefani's guest appearances on Moby's "South Side" in 2000 and Eve's "Let Me Blow Ya Mind" in 2001.
