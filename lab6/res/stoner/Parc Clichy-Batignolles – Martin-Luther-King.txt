Parc Clichy-Batignolles – Martin-Luther-King
The Parc Clichy-Batignolles or Parc Clichy-Batignolles - Martin Luther King is a green space in Paris' 17th arrondissement (district). It is part of a project to transform 54 hectares of land formerly occupied by freight yards for the French railway company SNCF.The park will eventually cover 10.8 ha, and 4 ha have been open to the public since 2007. When finished (scheduled for around 2015), it will be the largest green space in the 17th arrondissement, as well as the 8th biggest park in Paris. It is located in the Batignolles district, also extending into Épinettes. The main entrance is at 172 rue Cardinet and the nearest Métro station is Brochant. Recreation facilities include a skatepark, basketball courts and children's play area. Sustainable principles underpin the design of the park, and features include low maintenance plants; solar panels and wind turbines; reconstituted materials for walkways and rainwater harvesting. == References ==
