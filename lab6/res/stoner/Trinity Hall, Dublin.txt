Trinity Hall, Dublin
Trinity Hall is the main extramural hall of residence for students of the University of Dublin, Trinity College in Dublin, Republic of Ireland. It is located on Dartry Road in Dartry near Rathmines, about three miles south of the College. History The first extramural hall established by Trinity College under the name Trinity Hall was located near Hoggen Green (now College Green), on land which had originally been intended for use as a 'bridewell' or house of correction for vagrants. The land, located to the west of Trinity, was sold to the College by Dublin Corporation for the sum of Â£30 on condition that it be converted for educational use. A Master was appointed, buildings were constructed, and the site was used for teaching and residence by students from 1617 onwards. However, during the course of the 1641 Rebellion the site was occupied by poor people from the city. The hall having fallen into decay (which the College at the time could not afford to repair), Trinity discontinued its teaching there, causing the Corporation to seek that the site revert to their ownership on the grounds that the agreements for its use were not being upheld. The situation was resolved
