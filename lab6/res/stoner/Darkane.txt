Darkane
Darkane is a Swedish extreme metal band that originated in Helsingborg in 1998. Their music contains ample thrash elements interspersed with acoustic interludes and symphonic features, such as the in studio use of synthesizers and occasionally full orchestras and choir singing. The name Darkane is a portmanteau of the words "dark" and "arcane". History Formation and Rusted Angel (1998–2000) Darkane was formed by former Agretator guitarist Christofer Malmström and drummer Peter Wildoer, who recorded a 2-song demo in 1998. On the strength of these two songs, Darkane landed a record deal with War Music, and the band's lineup was completed by bassist Jörgen Löfberg, guitarist Klas Ideberg, and vocalist Bjorn “Speed” Strid. However, as vocalist of the already-established Soilwork, Speed was unable to continue dividing his time, and decided to leave Darkane. After a period of several months without a vocalist, he was replaced by vocalist Lawrence Mackrory, who was recommended by the band's producer, Daniel Bergstrand. Mackrory recorded all vocals on the debut album, Rusted Angel, and performed several live dates with the band later that year. However, due to other commitments, Mackrory was unable to tour with the band in early 1999, and was replaced by Andreas Sydow,
