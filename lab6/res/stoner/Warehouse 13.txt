Warehouse 13
Warehouse 13 is an American science fiction television series that ran from July 7, 2009 to May 19, 2014, on the Syfy network. Described as "part The X-Files, part Raiders of the Lost Ark and part Moonlighting", the show had Jack Kenny and David Simkins as executive producers.

Once retrieved and neutralized, the objects are stored in Warehouse 13, the latest in a line of storehouses with infinite capacity that have served this purpose for millennia.
