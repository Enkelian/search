Nistru Otaci
FC Nistru Otaci is a Moldovan football club based in Otaci, Moldova. History During the 1999–00 season, the club played as FC Nistru-Unisport Otaci due to Nistru being expelled in the summer of 1999. The club merged with Unisport Chişinău, which allowed Nistru to use Unisport's top flight position to play. However, this merge was canceled in 2000, sending Unisport back down to the Divizia A.
