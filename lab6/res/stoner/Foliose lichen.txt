Foliose lichen
Foliose lichen is one of a variety of lichens, which are complex organisms that arise from the symbiotic relationship between fungi and a photosynthetic partner, typically algae. This partnership allows lichen to live in diverse climates that can range from cold, dry mountains to wet, warm valleys. Lichens develop quite slowly with recorded growth rates of 0.01â€“27mm/year depending on the species. Their lifespan averages between 30 and 60 years (Armstrong & Bradwell pg.3). Lichens have a main body part called the thallus, which is composed of hyphae, and houses the cortex and medulla. The cortex contains the photosynthetic cells while the medulla allows for gas exchange and makes up the bulk of the lichen's thallus. There are three main types of lichens: crustose, foliose, and fruticose. Foliose lichen are characterised by flattened leafy thalli, and an upper and lower cortex. Many have numerous layers, which are stratified, and aid in identifying different types. Foliose lichens attach to surfaces by hyphae in the lower cortex with smaller root like structures called rhizines (Lichens of North America Pg 13, 3) Lichens play an important role environmentally. They provide a food source for many animals such as deer, goats, and caribou, and are
