Textile industry
The textile industry is primarily concerned with the design, production and distribution of yarn, cloth and clothing. The raw material may be natural, or synthetic using products of the chemical industry. Industry process Cotton manufacturing Cotton is the world's most important natural fibre. In the year 2007, the global yield was 25 million tons from 35 million hectares cultivated in more than 50 countries. There are five stages: Cultivating and Harvesting Preparatory Processes Spinning — giving yarn Weaving — giving fabrics Finishing — giving textilesCotton can be obtained in many ways like from weaving,knitting,even by using hand looms and power looms Synthetic fibres Artificial fibres can be made by extruding a polymer, through a spinneret into a medium where it hardens. Wet spinning (rayon) uses a coagulating medium. In dry spinning (acetate and triacetate), the polymer is contained in a solvent that evaporates in the heated exit chamber. In melt spinning (nylons and polyesters) the extruded polymer is cooled in gas or air and then sets. All these fibres will be of great length, often kilometres long. Artificial fibres can be processed as long fibres or batched and cut so they can be processed like a natural fibre. Natural fibres
