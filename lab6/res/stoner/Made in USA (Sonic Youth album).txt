Made in USA (Sonic Youth album)
Made in USA is an album by Sonic Youth, containing music the band scored for the 1987 film of the same name. The band recorded this material in 1986, shortly after the completion of their album EVOL, but the album was not released until 1995. A soundtrack for the film was also released in 1987, but unlike this release, did not contain any of the original score the band created for the film.
