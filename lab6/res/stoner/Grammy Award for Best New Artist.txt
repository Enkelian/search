It is sometimes asserted, with varying degrees of sincerity, that winning the award is a curse, as several award winners (particularly from the late 1970s and early 1980s) were never able to duplicate the success they experienced in their debut year. This viewpoint was expressed by former Starland Vocal Band member Taffy Danoff in a 2002 interview for VH1's 100 Greatest One Hit Wonders: "We got two of the five Grammys â€“ one was Best New Artist. So that was basically the kiss of death and I feel sorry for everyone who's gotten it since."The category is also notable for being the only one of its kind in which a Grammy Award was vacated. This occurred in 1990 after it was revealed
