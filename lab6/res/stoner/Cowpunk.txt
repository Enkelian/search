Cowpunk
Cowpunk (or country punk) is a subgenre of punk rock that began in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s and California in the early 1980s. It combines punk rock or new wave with country, folk, and blues in its sound, lyrical subject matter, attitude, and style. Examples include Boothill Foot Tappers, X, the Blasters, Meat Puppets, The Beat Farmers, Rubber Rodeo, Rank and File, Jason and the Scorchers, and Violent Femmes. Many of the musicians in this scene have become associated with alternative country or roots rock. History A 1984 New York Times article on the emerging aesthetic acknowledged "cowpunk" as one of several catch-all terms critics were using to categorize the country-influenced music of otherwise unrelated punk and new wave bands. The article briefly summarized the music's history, at least in the United States, saying that in the early 1980s, several punk and new wave bands had begun collecting classic country records, and soon thereafter began performing high-tempo cover versions of their favorite songs, and that new bands had also formed around the idea. By 1984, there were dozens of bands in both the U.S. and England "personalizing country music and making it palatable for the MTV Generation."
