Chicken-n-Beer
Chicken-n-Beer is the fourth studio album by American rapper Ludacris. It was released on October 7, 2003, by Disturbing tha Peace and Def Jam Recordings. Recording sessions took place from 2002 to 2003, and it was handled by several record producers, including DJ Nasty & LVM, Kanye West, Mo B. Dick, DJ Paul, Juicy J and Ludacris himself. The Southern hip hop album, Chicken-n-Beer is musically similar to Ludacris' previous work, with his use of a fast, highly versatile flow. Some of the songs on the album take a political overtone. The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, selling 429,000 copies in its first week; unlike Ludacris' previous albums, the album achieved success outside the United States, charting in several European territories; including Germany and the United Kingdom. Upon its release, Chicken-n-Beer received positive reviews, with critics praising Ludacris' technical rapping abilities and production choices, although some criticized the adult humor in the lyrics as excessive. It was supported by four singles that were released from the album, two of which – "Stand Up" and "Splash Waterfalls" – became Ludacris' first to peak in the top 10 on the US Billboard Hot 100.
