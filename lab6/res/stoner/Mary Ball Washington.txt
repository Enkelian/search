Mary Ball Washington
Mary Ball Washington, born Mary Ball (born sometime between 1707 and 1709 â€“ August 25, 1789), was the second wife of Augustine Washington, a planter in Virginia, and the mother of George Washington, the first President of the United States, and five other children. Early life Mary Ball was born sometime between 1707 and 1709 at either Epping Forest, her family's plantation in Lancaster County or at a plantation near the village of Simonson, Virginia. She was the only child of Col Joseph Ball (1649-1711) and his second wife, Mary Johnson Ball. Joseph was born in England and emigrated to Virginia as a child. Fatherless at three and orphaned at twelve, Mary Ball was placed under the guardianship of George Eskridge, a lawyer, in accordance with the terms of her mother's will, for whom her son George Washington, was named, consistent with the naming conventions at the time. Her paternal grandfather was William Ball (1615-c.1680); he left England for Virginia in the 1650s. His wife Hannah Atherold arrived later along with their four children, including Mary's father Joseph. Married life Augustine Washington had sailed to Britain on business (and to visit his sons who had been sent to school there)
