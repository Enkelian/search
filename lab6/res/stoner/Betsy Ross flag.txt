Betsy Ross flag
The Betsy Ross flag is an early design of the flag of the United States, named for early American upholsterer and flag maker Betsy Ross. The pattern of the Betsy Ross flag is 13 alternating red-and-white stripes with stars in a field of blue in the upper left corner canton. Its distinguishing feature is thirteen 5-pointed stars arranged in a circle representing the 13 colonies that fought for their independence during The American Revolutionary War. Since the beginning of the 20th century, the flag has been a popular symbol of American patriotism, though its origin story is based on a questionable family legend. Betsy Ross story Betsy Ross (1752 â€“ 1836) was an upholsterer in Philadelphia who produced uniforms, tents, and flags for Continental forces. Although her manufacturing contributions are documented, a popular story evolved in which Ross was hired by a group of founding fathers to make a new U.S. flag. According to the legend, she deviated from the 6-pointed stars in the design and produced a flag with 5-pointed stars, instead. The claim by her descendants that Betsy Ross contributed to the flag's design is not generally accepted by modern American scholars and vexillologists.Ross became a notable figure
