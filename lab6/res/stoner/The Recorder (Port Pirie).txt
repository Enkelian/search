The Recorder (Port Pirie)
The Recorder is a newspaper published in Port Pirie, South Australia since 1885. Formed by an amalgamation in 1898, it was also previously known as Port Pirie Recorder and North Western Mail between 1898 and 1918, and as The Recorder from 1919. History The town, later city, of Port Pirie had two newspapers, The Port Pirie Advocate and Areas News, published weekly from 21 March 1885, (later simplified to The Port Pirie Advocate (1895-1898)), and The Port Pirie Standard and Barrier Advertiser, published weekly from 4 January 1889. They amalgamated to form The Port Pirie Recorder and North Western Mail, first published on 9 July 1898, appearing on Saturday and Wednesday mornings, printed and published jointly by Alfred Edward South (1861 â€“ 1 January 1934) of the Advocate, and Charles Meyrick (died 3 January 1937) of the Standard. Their office was on Alexander Street, Port Pirie. Meyrick withdrew from the partnership around 1903 and on 6 April 1914 the paper became a daily. In January 1918, the newspaper was simplified to The Port Pirie Recorder, and in January 1919, South sold the paper to James Edward Davidson (died 1 June 1930) and it was simplified again to The Recorder.
