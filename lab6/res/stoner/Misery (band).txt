Misery (band)
Misery was an Australian death metal band from Brisbane, Queensland. Since forming in 1991, the band has released four albums and an EP. The band split in 2005, but has reformed once more for an East Coast Australian tour in support of its final album On Demon Wings in 2009. Background The group was formed in 1991 by bassist Damon Robinson and guitarist Scott Edgar, who had both been members of earlier Brisbane groups Guardian, Northwinds, Savage, A.I.M. and Black Magic. The band's first line-up featured Robinson, Edgar, drummer Anthony Dwyer, Northwinds guitarist Brad Allen, and vocalist Darren Goulding. Allen was soon replaced by Laszlo Khaninghinis, and the band recorded two demos in 1992 - Sorting of the Insects and Astern Diabolus before releasing their first album A Necessary Evil in 1993. Soon after the album's release, Misery's reputation as a heavy act was immediately established, and the band undertook its first national tour in support of Pungent Stench. Goulding was fired from the group not long after the tour, to be replaced by former Mausoleum vocalist Moises Contreras. Goulding would later go on to front Sydney band Sulkus, Wagga Wagga death metal group Manticore, and Sydney nu-metal outfit Art
