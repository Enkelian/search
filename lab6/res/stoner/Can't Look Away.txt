In a 2004 interview, Rabin described Can't Look Away as "by far my best solo album and the one I'm happiest with." The album was reissued in 2011 through Voiceprint Records. Critical reception Vik Iyengar of AllMusic gave Can't Look Away three stars out of five. He praised it for having "a great sense of melody and layered guitars to create an arena rock sound", while also remarking that "Although the album loses a bit of steam in the second half, the first half includes great pop/rock tunes. ... Fans of latter-day Yes should definitely check out this album."
