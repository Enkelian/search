Wolfmother
Wolfmother is an Australian hard rock band from Sydney, New South Wales. Formed in 2004, the group is centred around vocalist and guitarist Andrew Stockdale, who is the only constant member of the lineup. The band has been through many personnel changes since their formation, with the current incarnation including drummer Hamish Rosser and bassist Brad Heald, both of whom are former members of The Vines.

It was released internationally by Interscope and Island Records the following year, and to date has sold in excess of 1.5 million copies worldwide.
