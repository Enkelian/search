S. R. Srinivasa Varadhan
Sathamangalam Ranga Iyengar Srinivasa Varadhan FRS (born 2 January 1940) is an Indian American mathematician who is known for his fundamental contributions to probability theory and in particular for creating a unified theory of large deviations. Early life and education Srinivasa was born in Chennai (then Madras) in 1940. Varadhan received his under-graduate degree in 1959 from Presidency College, Madras, and then moved to the Indian Statistical Institute in Kolkata. He was one of the "famous four" (the others were R Ranga Rao, K R Parthasarathy, and Veeravalli S Varadarajan) in ISI during 1956–1963. He received his doctorate from ISI in 1963 under C R Rao, who arranged for Andrey Kolmogorov to be present at Varadhan's thesis defence. Since 1963, he has worked at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University, where he was at first a postdoctoral fellow (1963–66), strongly recommended by Monroe D Donsker. Here he met Daniel Stroock, who became a close colleague and co-author. In an article in the Notices of the American Mathematical Society, Stroock recalls these early years: Varadhan, whom everyone calls Raghu, came to these shores from his native India in the fall of 1963. He arrived by plane at
