MetLife Stadium
MetLife Stadium is an American sports stadium located at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey, 8 miles (13 km) west of New York City. It is the home stadium of two National Football League (NFL) franchises, the New York Giants and the New York Jets, as well as the New York Guardians of the XFL. Originally known as New Meadowlands Stadium upon opening in 2010, its naming rights were acquired in 2011 by New York City-based insurance company MetLife. The stadium is owned by the MetLife Stadium Company, a joint venture of the Giants and Jets, which privately financed the construction of the venue on land belonging to the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority. At an approximate cost of $1.6 billion, it was the most expensive stadium ever built at the time that it opened. History As Giants Stadium approached 30 years of age, it was becoming one of the older stadiums in the NFL. The Jets, who had been the tenants at the stadium, sought to have their own stadium built in Manhattan proper, the proposed West Side Stadium. Originally intended to be the 85,000-seat main stadium for New York's bid for the 2012 Summer
