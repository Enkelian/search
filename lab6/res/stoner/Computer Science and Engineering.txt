Computer Science and Engineering
Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) is an academic program at some universities that integrates the fields of computer engineering and computer science, providing knowledge of computing systems in both hardware and software design. The study program is modeled on German technical universities, where CS, CE and IT are treated as respectively the theoretical, technical and practical part of one field called "Informatik". Courses include computer architecture, processor design, operating systems, computer networks, parallel processing, embedded systems, circuit analysis, analog and digital electronics, computer graphics, cloud, web and mobile computing, software engineering, database systems, digital signal processing, virtualization, computer simulations and games programming. CSE programs also include core subjects of theoretical computer science such as theory of computation, design and analysis of algorithms, data structures, numerical analysis, machine learning, information theory, programming language theory and paradigms. The program aims at designing, developing and troubleshooting computing devices and systems (such as personal computers, supercomputers, robots, smartphones, networking devices, embedded devices), focusing the underlying fundamental issues (like processor architecture design, operating system design, memory management, digital system design, communication protocol design, system software development, application software development, database management, high-performance and scientific computing) in the most efficient and effective way.
