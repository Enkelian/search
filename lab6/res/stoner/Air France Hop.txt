Air France Hop
Air France Hop, formerly branded HOP!, is a French regional airline operating flights on behalf of its parent company Air France. The airline was founded on 21 December 2012 after the merger of Airlinair, Brit Air and Régional brands. Its head office is at Nantes Atlantique Airport. History The new airline brand was created to better compete with the low-cost airlines which have taken a significant market share of Air France's regional routes. Régional Compagnie Aérienne Européenne operated with 44 aircraft to 38 destinations; Brit Air had 39 aircraft and served 32 destinations; and Airlinair served 26 destinations with its 24 aircraft; a combined total of 107 aircraft. In July 2015, Air France-KLM announced the formalization of its merger for 2017 of the Brit Air, Régional and Airlinair brands under the Hop! Brand, after having already legally grouped its structures under the eponymous company, thereby reducing its costs.In October 2018, it was reported that HOP! will face restructuring measures, including the merger of all operations under the AF flight codes of parent Air France and a revision of the operated aircraft types.In February 2019, Air France announced that HOP! services will be rebranded as "Air France Hop".
