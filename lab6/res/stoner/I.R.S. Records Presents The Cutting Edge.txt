I.R.S. Records Presents The Cutting Edge
I.R.S. Records Presents: The Cutting Edge, also known as The Cutting Edge or IRS's The Cutting Edge, was a music program that aired on MTV (US) from March 1983 to September 1987, on the last Sunday of every month. The show was retitled The Cutting Edge Happy Hour in 1986. Background The show was intended to feature performers who might otherwise not be seen on MTV, and featured the earliest appearances on MTV for acts like Madonna, the Red Hot Chili Peppers and R.E.M. The co-founders of I.R.S., Miles Copeland III and Jay Boberg, also saw the program as an effective promotional tool for I.R.S. recording artists at a time when much of the music industry had not yet perceived the marketing value of music videos. Copeland later described himself as "the only record company executive ever to have had his own show on MTV". Broadcast history Produced by Jay Boberg and Carl Grasso of I.R.S. Records for MTV, and directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, the first year of the show featured a variety of hosts including Jools Holland, Jeffrey Vallance, and Wazmo Nariz, before settling on Peter Zaremba, the lead singer of the Fleshtones.
