Etcheverry Hall
Etcheverry Hall is a building on the UC Berkeley campus that houses the departments of mechanical, industrial, and nuclear engineering of the UC Berkeley College of Engineering. Etcheverry Hall is named after Bernard A. Etcheverry, professor of irrigation and drainage from 1915–51, who later served as chair of the Department of Irrigation and Drainage from 1923–51. Built in 1964, it is located on the north side of Hearst Avenue, across the street from the main campus. Berkeley Research Reactor The basement of Etcheverry once housed a research nuclear reactor, the Berkeley Research Reactor. The reactor was later removed, and neighboring Soda Hall was completed in 1994 to house the computer science department.The Berkeley Research Reactor was a TRIGA (Training, Research, Isotope production, General Atomics) Mark III pool-type reactor with a steady rated thermal power of 1 MW, capable of being pulsed to 2,000 MW. Professor Lawrence Ruby was the chairman of the Nuclear Engineering Reactor Committee and held key roles in the design and analysis of Etcheverry Hall to support reactor licensing, then served as the first reactor supervisor after it was completed. It first achieved criticality on August 10, 1966, and was used for irradiation of various items, as
