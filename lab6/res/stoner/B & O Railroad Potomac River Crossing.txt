B & O Railroad Potomac River Crossing
The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Crossings at the Potomac River are a set of railroad bridges that span the Potomac River between Maryland Heights, Maryland and Harpers Ferry, West Virginia in the United States. History The original Harper's Ferry operated from 1733 until it was replaced by a timber covered road bridge in about 1824 at the confluence of the Potomac and Shenandoah Rivers.In 1839, the B&O's first crossing over the Potomac was an 830 feet (250 m) covered wood truss. At the time, it was the first and only rail crossing of the Potomac River, and the only rail link between the two sides in the coming Civil War. John Brown used the bridge at the beginning of his failed attempt to start a slave insurrection in Virginia and further south. The single-track bridge, which comprised six river spans plus a span over the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, was designed by Benjamin Henry Latrobe, II.

The bridge was destroyed during the American Civil War and was subsequently replaced by temporary structures. In 1851, a second bridge was built across the Shenandoah
