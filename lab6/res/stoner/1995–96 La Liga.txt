1995–96 La Liga
The 1995–96 La Liga season, the 65th since its establishment, started on September 9, 1995, and finished on May 26, 1996. Team information Clubs and locations Notes With Mérida's promotion every Spanish autonomous community (though not every province) has been represented in Primera División. Initially, only 20 teams would play this season in Primera División, but Sevilla FC and Celta de Vigo were relegated to Segunda División B for not making their payments to the Royal Spanish Football Federation. Then, Albacete and Real Valladolid, initially relegated, were readmitted in Primera División. Later, Sevilla FC and Celta de Vigo were also readmitted and the league was expanded to 22 teams for two seasons. From this season on, wins were awarded 3 points instead of 2 (similar to other domestic leagues that had 3-1-0 team scoring point format).
