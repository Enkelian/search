Geffen Records
Geffen Records is an American record label established by David Geffen and owned by Universal Music Group through its Interscope Geffen A&M Records imprint. Geffen Records was started in 1980. In 1999, it was merged into Interscope Records and the Geffen Records name was practically dissolved. On March 23, 2017, Billboard magazine stated that Geffen Records was relaunching with longtime A&R person Neil Jacobson as President, who reports to John Janick, CEO and chairman of Interscope Geffen A&M. History Geffen Records began operations in 1980, having been started by music industry businessman David Geffen who, in the early 1970s, had founded Asylum Records. Geffen stepped down from Asylum in 1975, when he crossed over to film and was named a vice president of Warner Bros. Pictures. He was fired from Warner circa 1978, but still remained locked in a five-year contract, which prevented him from working elsewhere. When that deal expired, he returned to work in 1980 and struck a deal with, ironically, Warner Bros. Records, the sister company to Warner Bros. Pictures, to create Geffen Records. Warner Bros. Records provided 100 percent of the funding for the label's start-up and operations and Warner distributed its releases in North America,
