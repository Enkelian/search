Drama!
"Drama!" is the first single released in September 1989 by Erasure from their fourth studio album Wild!. It was issued by Mute Records in the UK and Sire Records in the United States. Written by Vince Clarke and Andy Bell, the synthpop song begins with a low-key keyboard line and a subdued vocal from Bell. As the song progresses, the instrumentation and vocals become more hectic, ultimately ending as a full-blown dance track. "Drama!" contains a "Guilty!" exclamation throughout, provided by Scottish band The Jesus and Mary Chain, who were recording in the studio next door.Released prior to Wild!, "Drama!" continued Erasure's streak of hits on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number four. The single also fared well in Denmark, where it reached number 3 and in Germany, where it hit number 12. "Drama!" did not continue Erasure's chart success in the United States, where it failed to enter the Billboard Hot 100. It did, however, climb to number 10 on the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. The b-side, "Sweet Sweet Baby" contains a vocal sample from the 1968 Jane Fonda film "Barbarella".
