Can't Stop the Music (album)
Can't Stop the Music is the sixth studio album and first soundtrack by Village People, for their movie Can't Stop the Music, released in 1980. Though the movie was a commercial failure, the album was more well received, reaching #9 on the UK Albums Chart, #47 on the Billboard 200 in the US, and #1 in Australia (on the Kent Music Report). The album was reissued on CD in 1999. In addition to songs by Village People, the album also contains songs by David London and The Ritchie Family. The album also features a re-make of "Y.M.C.A.", which was actually the original 1978 recording with lead singer Victor Willis' voice removed and replaced by lead vocals from new singer Ray Simpson. Simpson's version was not released as a single and, hence, never charted. This is the first Village People album that was not certified Gold by the RIAA. The album was the Village People's last official album for Casablanca. They would leave the label for RCA Records shortly after its release.
