Cinematic Symphony
The Cinematic Symphony (formerly known as the Austin Wind Symphony) is a musical ensemble based in Austin, Texas. The group is composed of volunteers and is dedicated to preserving and performing the music of film and television. Overview The group was founded on June 7, 2005 by its original conductor, Patrick Phillips. The 50+-piece volunteer ensemble was assembled in an effort to create a stronger awareness of and appreciation for Film and Television scoring and its composers. The name was changed in 2010 to "Cinematic Symphony" to more accurately reflect the full orchestra's classification and purpose.
