Keio Line (album)
Keio Line is a collaborative studio album by the French electronic rock guitarist Richard Pinhas and the Japanese noise musician Merzbow. The album was released in September 2008, on double CD by Cuneiform Records in the US and on triple LP by Dirter Promotions in the UK. It is the first of several collaborations between Pinhas and Merzbow. Background and recording Richard Pinhas and Masami Akita (Merzbow) first met when Merzbow opened for Pinhas' 2006 show in Tokyo. Pinhas recalled that he was "astonished" when he saw Merzbow play, and that he felt an immediate connection with Merzbow. When Pinhas returned to Tokyo in 2007, he suggested a collaboration to Akita. As Akita had been a longtime a fan of Pinhas and his band Heldon, he readily agreed. For the recording Akita used the vintage analog EMS Synthi A synthesizer, which he says has a "very spacey and somewhat mellower sound". He described the sessions as improvised and played "very spontaneously". Pinhas says that they didn't plan anything beforehand.The album is named for the Kei≈ç Line railway that took them to the recording studio, during which time they talked. Akita notes that Pinhas was involved in the 60s protest movement
