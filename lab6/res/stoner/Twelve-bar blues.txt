Twelve-bar blues
The twelve-bar blues (or blues changes) is one of the most prominent chord progressions in popular music. The blues progression has a distinctive form in lyrics, phrase, chord structure, and duration. In its basic form, it is predominantly based on the I, IV, and V chords of a key. Mastery of the blues and rhythm changes are "critical elements for building a jazz repertoire". Standard progressions In the key of C, one basic blues progression (E from above) is as follows.

Using said notations, the chord progression outlined above can be represented as follows. The first line takes
