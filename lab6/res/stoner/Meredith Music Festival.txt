Meredith Music Festival
The Meredith Music Festival (otherwise known simply as Meredith or MMF) is a three-day outdoor music festival held every December at the "Supernatural Amphitheatre", a natural amphitheatre located on private farmland near the town of Meredith in Victoria, Australia. A self-funded, non-commercial event that was first held in 1991, the festival spawned Golden Plains, a music festival that takes place over the Labour Day long weekend in March. Description The festival is held on a private property owned by the family of one of the organisers, Chris Nolan near the town of Meredith. Since the Nolans own the site, permanent infrastructure has been built including showers, compost toilets, and recycled water with the surrounding areas setup for usage of tents, vans, caravans or motorhomes. The culture and music of the festival reflects the strength, and diversity of the Melbourne and surrounding music scene. Warren Ellis (musician) (Dirty Three / Grinderman) referred to it as "the world's best festival" in a recent interview.
