The Continental (Saturday Night Live)
"The Continental" is a recurring sketch on Saturday Night Live (SNL) featuring Christopher Walken. The first sketch aired on the eleventh episode of the fifteenth season, January 20, 1990. History It is a parody of Renzo Cesana, who starred in a 1952â€“1953 CBS series, The Continental. The series used a subjective camera, and Cesana spoke directly to women in the viewing audience. Cesana's show was subjected to many parodies, including Mad magazine's "The Countynental" (which was also the name used in a parody by Ernie Kovacs), Red Skelton's "The Transcontinental", and Floyd Vivino's "Ricardo Romantico." The premise of the SNL sketch is that Walken is a "suave ladies' man" who in reality can't say or do anything to keep women from giving him the cold shoulder, typically due to a number of perverse actions that often border on sexual predation. For instance, he invites a woman to wash up in his bathroom. Once she is inside, it becomes obvious that the bathroom mirror is a two-way mirror when the Continental is seen lighting up a cigarette. The Continental has both a telescope with which to "spy" on his female neighbors and a collection of "erotic" Hummel figurines he acquired on
