Glenmont is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in Montgomery County, Maryland, United States. The United States Census Bureau had combined Glenmont with nearby Wheaton to create the census-designated place of Wheaton-Glenmont, from 2000 to 2010. It had a population of 13,529 in 2010. Geography Due to its unincorporated nature, the boundaries are difficult to precisely define, but the center of the community is located at the intersection of Randolph Road and Georgia Avenue (Maryland State Highway 97). History In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the area contained a few houses and small farms lining the Washingtonâ€“Brookeville Turnpike, as Georgia Avenue was then called. The Hardy family farm was located between current-day Randolph Road and Parker Avenue and stayed in the family for generations. In 1898, Mary Hardy gave the name Glenmont to the area's post office at what is now Georgia Avenue and Randolph Road. Annie Lofler was appointed the new postmaster of Glenmont in 1900. Although the post office was closed in 1901, the name for the area stuck, albeit occasionally misspelled as Glenmount.Glenmont's first school opened in 1926. Built at a cost of $50,000, the Glenmont School had 136 students enrolled in its first school year.
