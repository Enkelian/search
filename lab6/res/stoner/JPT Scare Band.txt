JPT Scare Band is an American rock band. It took its name from its members first initials and their "scary" acid rock sound. Although the band did not release their first album until the early 1990s, they had formed in the early 1970s and made numerous recordings on a reel to reel tape deck in a basement.Songs from the album, Sleeping Sickness, went into fairly heavy rotation on FM stations WFMU and WNYU in New York, which played a major role in dredging JPT up from the depths of total obscurity. The band was featured in an article in the March 2007 issue of Classic Rock Magazine titled, "The Lost Pioneers of Heavy Metal".In 2010, Rhapsody (online music service) called their album Past is Prologue one of the best "proto-metal" albums of all time.The three original members of the band are still active, having released two albums on their own Kung Bomar Records label. A third album was released on the Kung Bomar label, Halloween of 2009, called Rumdum Daddy.The band signed a contract with new indie label, Ripple Music in January 2010. The first album released by Ripple in June 2010 was a new album titled, Acid Blues Is
