A–Z (album)
A–Z is the debut studio album by Colin Newman, lead singer for post-punk band Wire. It was released in October 1980, through record label Beggars Banquet. Critical reception A–Z has been well received. In its retrospective review, AllMusic wrote "A-Z truly deserves to be held in the same regard as Pink Flag, Chairs Missing and 154". Jason Parkes of Head Heritage wrote that it was "probably the best album [released] between the first and second phases of Wire". Legacy "Alone" and "Not Me" were covered by This Mortal Coil on the albums Filigree & Shadow and It'll End in Tears, respectively. "S-S-S-Star Eyes" was covered by P-Model and released as a supplementary cassette to an issue of the band's fan club newsletter. "Alone" was used in the 1991 film The Silence of the Lambs.
