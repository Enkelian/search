Midlands
The Midlands is the central part of England and a cultural area that broadly corresponds to the early medieval Kingdom of Mercia. The Midlands region is bordered by Northern England and Southern England. The Midlands were important in the Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries. Two of the nine official regions of England are the West Midlands and East Midlands. Birmingham, in the West Midlands, is the second-largest city and metropolitan area in the United Kingdom. Extent The Midlands are defined as being made up of the regions of East Midlands and West Midlands, and may include the counties of Derbyshire, Herefordshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire but do not include the boroughs of North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire, Nottinghamshire, Rutland, Shropshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire, Worcestershire and the West Midlands metropolitan boroughs. If not following the official regional boundaries, the Midlands may also include Peterborough and Banbury (of which areas were historically part of Northamptonshire), Marple and Sheffield (of which areas were historically part of Derbyshire), Finningley (historically part of Nottinghamshire), and the aforementioned boroughs of Lincolnshire. Additionally, there is an informal region known as the South Midlands which is considered to include the southern parts of the East Midlands
