The Ventures in Space
The Ventures in Space is an LP album by the guitar-based instrumental group the Ventures, released in 1964. Information on its jacket states that "All of these unusual & other-worldly sounds have been created with musical instruments rather than electronic gimmicks". It was one of the first albums on which the group played the new Mosrite brand guitars instead of their traditional Fender instruments. The album was released in 1964 on the Dolton label, and reissued in the late 1970s by Pickwick Records (with a new cover depicting an astronaut performing a spacewalk). Reception In his review for Allmusic, critic Richie Unterberger wrote of the album "Few listeners need to dig deeper than a greatest-hits collection for the Ventures, but this early effort is an arguable exception... The British instrumental group the Tornados (of "Telstar" fame) did this kind of stuff better, but Ventures in Space is a fun diversion from their usual sound that holds up well."
