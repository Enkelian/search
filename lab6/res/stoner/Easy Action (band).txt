Easy Action (band)
Easy Action is a Swedish band from Stockholm that was first formed in 1981 by Pelle Almgren (ex-Warhead), Henrik "2 meter" Jermsten (ex-Stoodes), Bosse Belsen (aka Zinny J. Zan of Shotgun Messiah/Kingpin/Zan Clan - drums) and Björne Fröberg (bass, ex-Warhead). Bosse and Björne quit and were replaced by Ola "Skox" Andersson and drummer Urban "Ubbe" Sundbaum (ex-Lustans Lakejer). Stranded Records became interested and released the single "Honcho Bongo". It didn't sell well and when the second single, "Om jag vore kung", also failed the band split up. Skox and 2 meter formed Psyhedelic Mongo and Pelle Almgren started writing songs instead.Easy Action was reformed as a glam metal band in 1982 by Kee Marcello and Alex Tyrone (aka Peo Thyrén). The two played together in the Swedish glam act Noice when they decided to start the ultimate glam rock band, mixing their influences of 1970s glam with a punk/metal attitude. They met the original singer Bosse Belsen, now named Zinny J. Zan, at the Stockholm rock club Ritz and recorded his vocals on the first demos the very same night. Later the Noice drummer Fredrik Von Gerber and the guitar player Danny Wilde joined the band. Bassplayer. Per-Olof Thyrén In
