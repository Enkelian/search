Sky Q
Sky Q is a subscription-based television and entertainment service provided by satellite broadcaster Sky Group in the UK, Ireland, Germany, Austria and Italy. The flagship product from Sky, Sky Q originally launched in 2016 as a major revamp of the previous Sky+ and Sky+ HD services it replaced. Sky Q has been referred to as a "multimedia platform" that combines conventional television with on demand and catch up services, as well as third-party services. It includes a PVR set top box, multiroom set top box, a dedicated broadband-connected "hub", and applications for mobile and desktop devices. As of April 2018, Sky Q was in 2.5 million homes in the UK, Ireland and Italy. In July 2018, Sky reported that there were 3.6 million Sky Q customers. Launch Sky Q was first announced by Sky UK in November 2015, formerly known as Project Ethan, and was released in the UK in February 2016. It was later also released for Sky Italia customers in November 2017 and in May 2018 for Sky Deutschland. In contrast to Sky UK and Sky Italia, existing customers in Germany and Austria could receive Sky Q through a free software update on existing UHD-capable "Sky+ Pro" receivers.
