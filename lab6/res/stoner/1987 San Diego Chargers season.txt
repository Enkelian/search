1987 San Diego Chargers season
The 1987 San Diego Chargers season was the franchise's strike-shortened 18th season in the National Football League (NFL), and the 28th overall. The team improved on their 4–12 record in 1986 to 8-7 but missed the playoffs. The strike of 1987 reduced the regular season schedule from sixteen to fifteen games. Their stadium, Jack Murphy Stadium, hosted Super Bowl XXII at the end of the season. The Chargers started the season 8–1, with victories over playoff teams Indianapolis and Cleveland, before notoriously losing their final six games of the season, narrowly missing the playoffs. All but one of their final six losses came to teams that made the postseason in 1987. 1987 was the final season for Chargers quarterback Dan Fouts, who had been with the team since 1973, had led the league in passing four times, and who retired only the third quarterback in history to pass for more than 40,000 yards. Also retiring after the season was tight end Kellen Winslow; ending his career after having played since 1979.
