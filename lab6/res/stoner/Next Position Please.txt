Next Position Please
Next Position Please is the seventh studio album by American rock band Cheap Trick, produced by Todd Rundgren and released in 1983. The title track was originally demoed for the band's 1979 album Dream Police, which had lead singer Robin Zander, lead guitarist Rick Nielsen, and bassist Tom Petersson each singing a verse. The song did not go beyond a demo, but it was referenced in "High Priest of Rhythmic Noise", a track from 1980's All Shook Up. "Position" was eventually re-recorded for this album, and features only Zander singing. Background Produced by Todd Rundgren, Next Position Please marks a return to the more pop-oriented sound of 1977's In Color. The LP spent 22 weeks on the Billboard 200 LP charts and peaked at number 61. The then-band members (Zander, Nielsen, Jon Brant, and Bun E. Carlos) consider it one of their best albums. "I Can't Take It" has become a concert staple over the years. Several of the album's tracks were re-worked versions of older material, such as the title track and "You Talk Too Much."Physical copies of the album were out of print for several years (except in Japan), but on April 6, 2010, it was reissued together
