Texas Capitol View Corridors
The Capitol View Corridors are a series of legal restrictions on construction in Austin, Texas, aimed at preserving the visibility of the Texas State Capitol from various points around the city. First established by the Texas Legislature in 1983 and recodified in 2001, the corridors are meant to protect the capitol dome from obstruction by high-rise buildings. The corridors significantly limit the potential for the development of new tall structures in downtown Austin. History In 1931, the City of Austin enacted a local ordinance limiting the height of new buildings to a maximum of 200 feet (61 m), aiming to preserve the visual preeminence of the Texas State Capitol. From that time until the early 1960s, only the University of Texas Main Building Tower was built higher than the limit, using an exception allowing for additional height with a greater setback. On November 10, 1962, the Austin Statesman announced that real-estate developers were planning a new high-rise residential building adjacent to the capitol called the Westgate Tower. The proposed design for the tower significantly exceeded the city's height limit (though it compensated with a setback for the upper portion).The prospect of so tall a structure so close to the capitol
