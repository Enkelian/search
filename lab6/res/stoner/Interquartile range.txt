Interquartile range
In descriptive statistics, the interquartile range (IQR), also called the midspread, middle 50%, or H‑spread, is a measure of statistical dispersion, being equal to the difference between 75th and 25th percentiles, or between upper and lower quartiles, IQR = Q3 − Q1. In other words, the IQR is the first quartile subtracted from the third quartile; these quartiles can be clearly seen on a box plot on theles; and they are denoted by Q1, Q2, and Q3, respectively. Use Unlike total range, the interquartile range has a breakdown point of 25%, and is thus often preferred to the total range. The IQR is used to build box plots, simple graphical representations of a probability distribution. The IQR is used in businesses as a marker for their income rates. For a symmetric distribution (where the median equals the midhinge, the average of the first and third quartiles), half the IQR equals the median absolute deviation (MAD). The median is the corresponding measure of central tendency. The IQR can be used to identify outliers (see below). The quartile deviation or semi-interquartile range is defined as half the IQR. Algorithm The IQR of a set of values is calculated as the difference between
