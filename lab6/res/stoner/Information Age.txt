Information Age
The Information Age (also known as the Computer Age, Digital Age, or New Media Age) is a historic period beginning in the late 20th century and characterized by the rapid shift from traditional industry that the Industrial Revolution brought through industrialization to an economy primarily based upon information technology. The onset of the Information Age can be associated with the development of transistor technology, particularly the MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor), which revolutionized modern technology and became the fundamental building block of digital electronics in the information age.According to the United Nations Public Administration Network, the Information Age formed by capitalizing on computer microminiaturization advances. This usage of computing technology within the wider society has led to modernized information and communication processes becoming the driving force of social evolution. Progression Library expansion Library expansion was calculated in 1945 by Fremont Rider to double in capacity every 16 years if sufficient space were made available. He advocated replacing bulky, decaying printed works with miniaturized microform analog photographs, which could be duplicated on-demand for library patrons or other institutions. He did not foresee the digital technology that would follow decades later to replace analog microform with digital imaging, storage, and transmission media. Automated,
