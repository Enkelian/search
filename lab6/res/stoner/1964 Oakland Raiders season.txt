1964 Oakland Raiders season
The 1964 Oakland Raiders season was the team's fifth in both Oakland and the American Football League. The campaign saw the team attempt to improve upon its impressive 10–4 record from 1963. The Raiders' efforts, however, would prove fruitless. The team staggered out to an abysmal 1–7–1 record over its first nine games. While the Raiders pulled themselves together over the final five games of the season (in what amounted to a 4–0–1 run), their slow start ensured that they would miss the postseason for a fifth consecutive year. During the preseason, the Raiders played the Houston Oilers in Las Vegas, Nevada in the first professional football game ever held there. 56 years later, the team would move to the Las Vegas Area.
