The Remarkables
The Remarkables are a mountain range and skifield in Otago in the South Island of New Zealand. Located on the southeastern shore of Lake Wakatipu, the range lives up to its name by rising sharply to create an impressive backdrop for the waters. The range is clearly visible from the nearby town of Queenstown. The highest point in the range is Single Cone (2319 metres). The adjacent Hector Mountains southeast of the Remarkables culminate in Mount Tūwhakarōria (2307 m).There are a number of small lakes on the mountains including Lake Alta which forms part of the Remarkables Skifield. The mountains were named The Remarkables by Alexander Garvie in 1857-58, allegedly because they are one of only two mountain ranges in the world which run directly north to south. An alternate explanation for the name given by locals is that early Queenstown settlers, upon seeing the mountain range during sunset one evening, named them the Remarkables to describe the sight. Skifield During the winter months, the Remarkables skifield has skiing and other winter activities. The ski area has three mountain bowls covering 540 acres (2.2 km²). The patrolled area covers 220 ha with seven lifts (4 chairlifts, 3 magic carpets). Terrain
