X (Spock's Beard album)
X is the tenth studio album by American progressive rock band Spock's Beard. Similar to what Marillion did for Anoraknophobia, the album was funded by pre-orders of a limited edition of the album before the album was recorded. Those who ordered the album's "Ultra Package" had their names listed in the CD booklet and included as part of the track "Their Names Escape Me", which is exclusive to the limited edition. The album was released independently in May 2010. A retail and digital release with Mascot Records was released in August 2010. This album is the last studio album recorded with Nick D'Virgilio performing lead vocals, who left the band on November 18, 2011 to focus on other commitments. He rejoined the band in 2017, returning to his former role as drummer. Track listing Notes The above track listing is for the special edition. There are a few changes with the standard edition: "The Emperor's Clothes" and "Kamikaze" are swapped over in the track listing. "From the Darkness" has a slightly longer running time of 17:09. "Their Names Escape Me" is not included. Personnel Nick D'Virgilio – lead and backing vocals, drums, additional guitars Alan Morse – guitars, backing vocals
