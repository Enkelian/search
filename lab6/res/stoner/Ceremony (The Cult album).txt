Ceremony (The Cult album)
}} Ceremony is the fifth studio album by rock band The Cult, first released on 23 September 1991. Album information Ceremony represented a period of great turmoil within the band. Longtime bassist Jamie Stewart had departed prior to recording, and the working relationship between vocalist Ian Astbury and guitarist Billy Duffy was at an all-time low. The pair reportedly rarely agreed to appear at the studio together, opting to record their parts separately at different times. The album was highly anticipated by both music critics and fans as a result of the band's previous worldwide successes with their 1987 album Electric and its 1989 follow-up Sonic Temple. It was heavily inspired by Native American culture. The band was sued for $61,000,000 by the parents of the Native American boy pictured on the album cover.The album reached #25 in the U.S. and reached #9 in Canada, and achieved platinum status, but sales suffered with the arrival of grunge rock and time spent dealing with the lawsuit. Some countries, including South Korea and Thailand, did not see the record's release until 1992 and it was unreleased in Turkey until the Cult played several shows in Istanbul in June 1993.
