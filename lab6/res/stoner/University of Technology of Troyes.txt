University of Technology of Troyes
The University of Technology of Troyes (Université de Technologie de Troyes; UTT) is a French university, in the Academy of Reims. The UTT is part of the network of the three universities of technology, found by the University of Technology of Compiègne. Inspired by the American University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, these three universities (UTC, UTBM and UTT) are a French mixture between the universities of this country and its schools of engineers (Grandes Ecoles).UTT is ranked in the top 10 engineering schools 2017 in France by Usine Nouvelle. They are indeed organized like the universities, temples of knowledge being based on the triptych teaching-research-valorization (transmission of knowledge, the creation of knowledge and the transfer of knowledge in economic fabric). Their teaching model is a mix between the North-American model and the French traditions: courses choice, separation of the courses, work directed (TDs) and practical work (TPs). These three universities give thus an engineering degree equivalent to the Bac+5 formations of the French Grandes Ecoles. The UTT was founded in 1994 and inaugurated by Jacques Chirac. One of the first chairman of the university has been Thierry Breton (1997–2005), honorary Chairman of both Thomson and France Telecom, and former finance
