Headlong (song)
"Headlong" is a song by the British rock band Queen. It was released as the third single from Queen's 1991 album Innuendo. The song was written by Queen guitarist Brian May, who intended to record it for his then-upcoming solo album Back to the Light (1992), but when he heard Queen lead singer Freddie Mercury sing the track, he allowed it to become a Queen song. As with all the songs on Innuendo, the track was promptly credited to the entire band. The song was the first single to be released in the United States under their contract with Hollywood Records on 14 January 1991, though it was not released in the United Kingdom for another four months (the first single in the United Kingdom was "Innuendo", which Hollywood eventually released in the US as a promotional single for radio stations). The song charted on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in the United States at #3. The cover of one of the CD singles is inspired by Grandville illustrations, as are all of the other singles from the album. Chart performance "Headlong" was the third single release from the album Innuendo in the band's native UK. Released in May
