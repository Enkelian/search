Jack Off Jill was an American alternative rock band from Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, founded in 1992 by vocalist Jessicka, drummer Tenni Ah-Cha-Cha, Agent Moulder, and guitarist Michelle Inhell. Though these four women were the initial founders, twelve members rotated through the group in its life-span, including Scott Putesky, guitarist and co-founder of Marilyn Manson. The band lasted eight years, with only Jessicka remaining through all its line-ups. The band reunited in 2015 for a number of shows. History Tenni Arslanyan met Jessicka while attending Piper High School in Sunrise, Florida.
