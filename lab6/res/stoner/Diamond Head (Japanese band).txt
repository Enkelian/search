Diamond Head (Japanese band)
Diamond Head was a Japanese band formed of session musicians and producers. They first gained notability as the backing and touring band for Hitomi Yaida. History Working as a band in their own right they wrote and performed the song "le vent brulant" in 2001, which was used for some of the Japanese television coverage of the 2004 Formula-1 season. This track, an instrumental, was included on both Yaida's single "Look Back Again/Over The Distance" and the compilation album Grand Prix: Super Collection 2004 Working around a core of four experienced producers with high experience and expertise with their chosen instruments, they expanded the group to include other specialists to achieve a polished sound on all. Formed by solo musician and producer Kataoka Daishi along with instrumentalist Murata Akira they were joined by guitarist Susumu Nishikawa and keyboardist Ura Kiyohide (who had previously been a member of the band North Wind Knights with Daishi.)As a group, they are credited as producers and session musicians on every Hitomi Yaida release until 2005 when Diamond Head was dissolved and each individual artist received their own credits from then on, with Murata Akira taking over the bulk of her sound production from Katoaka
