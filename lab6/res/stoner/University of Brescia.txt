University of Brescia
The University of Brescia (Italian: Universit√† degli Studi di Brescia) is an Italian public research university located in Brescia, Italy. It was founded in 1982 and is branched in 4 Faculties. The University of Brescia was officially established in 1982 with three Schools: Medicine and Surgery, Engineering, Economics and Business.

History A first initiative came from the Chamber of Commerce and the Provincial Administration, which opened negotiations in the early 1960s to set up a two-year course in Engineering as a branch of Politecnico di Milano. The excessive financial requirements caused the project to lapse. After this first attempt, the creation of the future Schools of Brescia moved along two distinct paths, one concerning the School of Economics, the other those of Engineering and Medicine. In the field of economic studies, in 1964 a School of Industrial Administration was created, offering two-year courses. The creation of the Schools of Engineering and Medicine had a different history.
