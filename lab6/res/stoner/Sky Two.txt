Sky Two
Sky Two is a British pay television channel operated by Sky as a sister channel to Sky One and Sky Witness. The current channel began broadcasting (as Sky One Mix) in December 2002. The 'Sky 2' name and format had earlier been used for a similar service which broadcast on analogue platforms for a year from 1996. Original channel The original Sky 2 was a short-lived television channel launched by British Sky Broadcasting on 1 September 1996 as a sister channel to Sky One, and which formed part of an expanding bouquet of channels in Sky's analogue package around this time, including The Computer Channel and Sky Scottish. Sky 2 broadcast from 7:00 PM to 6:00 AM nightly, timesharing with another new channel, Fox Kids (now Disney XD) in daytime. During the time Sky 2 was operating, Sky One was rebranded as 'Sky 1' (reverting to 'Sky One' again from 1997 until 2008.) Sky used the launch of the new channel and the rebrand of Sky 1 to introduce DOGs, on both channels. On its opening night Sky 2 held an X-Files theme night. In addition to programmes shared with its parent, the new channel showed exclusive first-run television shows.
