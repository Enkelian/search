Witchcult Today
Witchcult Today is the sixth studio album by English doom metal band Electric Wizard released on 20 November 2007. Album information The band's fascination with horror movies and writers continues here with "Satanic Rites of Drugula", a reference to the Hammer Studios horror film The Satanic Rites of Dracula, and "Dunwich", a reference to H.P. Lovecraft's short story The Dunwich Horror; also "Black Magic Rituals & Perversions (I. Frisson Des Vampires II. Zora)" makes reference to Jean Rollin film Le Frisson des Vampires (Shiver of the Vampires) and to Italian comic book character Zora the Vampire. Furthermore, the album cover of "Witchcult Today" is edited from the poster for The Devil Rides Out and is reminiscent of a scene from the 1975 occult thriller Race with the Devil. Critical reception Reviews for Witchcult Today were mostly positive, with Thom Jurek of Allmusic writing "Musically, Electric Wizard inhabit the same basic world of stoner/doom/sludge they always have."
