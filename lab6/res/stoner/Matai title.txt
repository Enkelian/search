Matai title
Fa'amatai is the chiefly system of Samoa, central to the organization of Samoan society. It is the traditional indigenous form of governance in the Samoa Islands, comprising American Samoa and the Independent State of Samoa. The term comprises the prefix fa'a (Samoan for "in the way of") and the word matai (family name or title). Of central importance in the system are the matai, the holders of family chief titles, and their role in looking after their family. Fa'amatai is the key socio-political system of governance and way of life (fa'a Samoa) in Samoan culture. Inherent in the fa'amatai system is the welfare and well-being of the extended family ('aiga) and the protection of family property, consisting most importantly of customary land. The four major title holders â€“ Malietoa, Mata'afa, Tuimaleali'ifano and Tupua Tamasese are together known as the Tama-a-Aiga. All heads of state of Samoa have been one of the four title holders. In the 49-seat Legislative Assembly of Samoa, all 47 Samoan members are also matai, performing dual roles as chiefs and modern politicians, with the exception of the two seats reserved for non-Samoans.The 2011 census of Samoa identified 16,787 matai out of a total population of 187,820
