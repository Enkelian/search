Hymn to Liberty
The "Hymn to Liberty" or "Hymn to Freedom" (Greek: Ὕμνος εἰς τὴν Ἐλευθερίαν, romanized: Hýmnos is tin Eleftherían, pronounced [ˈimnos is tin elefθeˈrian], also Greek: Ύμνος προς την Ελευθερίαν Hýmnos pros tin Eleftherían pronounced [ˈim.nos pros tin elefθeˈri.an], lit. ' "Anthem to Liberty"') is a poem written by Dionysios Solomos in 1823 that consists of 158 stanzas, which is used as the national anthem of Greece and Cyprus. It was set to music by Nikolaos Mantzaros, and is the longest national anthem in the world by length of text. In 1865, the first three stanzas (and later the first two) officially became the national anthem of Greece and, from 1966, also that of Cyprus. History Dionysios Solomos wrote "Hymn to Liberty" in 1823 in Zakynthos and one year later was printed in Messolonghi. It was set to music in 1865 by the Corfiot operatic composer Nikolaos Mantzaros, who composed two choral versions, a long one for the whole poem and a short one for the first two stanzas; the latter is the one adopted as the national anthem of Greece. "Hymn to Liberty" was adopted as the national anthem of Cyprus by order of the Council of Ministers in 1966.
