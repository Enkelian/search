Hands of Time
Hands of Time is the third studio album by Kingdom Come. Background In 1989, Kingdom Come released their second LP, 'In Your Face', with (initially) strong sales to rival their platinum selling debut, when the band abruptly broke up for personal reasons in August 1989. Without the rest of the band, lead vocalist and primary songwriter Lenny Wolf chose to retain the band's name and record a third album, the band's final international release on Polygram. Co-writing with Hands of Time songwriter Carol Tatum (Angels of Venice), Wolf recorded the album with several session guitarists and drummers, including future Poison guitarist Blues Saraceno and former Dancer drummer Bam Bamm Shibley. As well as singing and co-writing all the songs, Wolf also played bass and produced the album.
