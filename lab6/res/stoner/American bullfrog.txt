American bullfrog
The American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus), often simply known as the bullfrog in Canada and the United States, is an amphibious frog, a member of the family Ranidae, or "true frogs". This frog has an olive green back and sides blotched with brownish markings and a whitish belly spotted with yellow or grey. The upper lip is often bright green and males have yellow throats. It typically inhabits large, permanent water bodies, such as swamps, ponds, and lakes, though it can also reside along smaller creeks and streams where it is usually found along the water's edge. Bullfrogs can also occasionally be found inhabiting urban areas near ditches and culverts. The male bullfrog defends a territory during the breeding season. His call is reminiscent of the roar of a bull, which gives the frog its common name. This frog is native to southern and eastern parts of the United States and Canada, but has been widely introduced across other parts of North, Central and South America, Western Europe, and parts of Asia, and in some areas is regarded as a pest and an invasive species. The bullfrog is harvested for use as food in North America and in several other countries
