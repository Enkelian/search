Left Spine Down
Left Spine Down (also known by the abbreviation LSD) is a Canadian band based in Vancouver, British Columbia that plays what they call "cyberpunk": a mixture of electronica, metal, punk, and drum & bass. History The group formed in Vancouver in 2001 with Matt Girvan, Frank Valoczy and Kaine Delay, with Jeremy Inkel replacing Valoczy in 2003 (Jared Slingerland joined the following year). They spent the next five years honing their skill and recruiting talent, all the while drawing attention to Bill Leeb, whom hired both Inkel and Slingerland into Front Line Assembly for the Artificial Soldier tour and album in 2006. LSD had begun to build a cult following, both local and abroad, and not until they found bass player Denyss McKnight and Tim Hagberg did they self-release their debut Smartbomb EP, in June 2007. The EP was produced by Front Line Assembly/Noise Unit's Chris Peterson. Their debut LP, Fighting for Voltage, was released in April 2008 on Synthetic Sounds in Canada, and a Canadian tour followed in support of the album. Bit Riot Records picked up the rights to the release of Fighting for Voltage in the USA and released the album in September 2008.On March 3, 2009
