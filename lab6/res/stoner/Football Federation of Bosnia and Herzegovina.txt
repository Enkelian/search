In May 2002, Football Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina was unified to include both Bosnian regional football associations, the Football Association of Republika Srpska, and the already unified Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina with the Football Federation of Herzeg-Bosnia. In April 2011, it changed its name if that from Football Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina to Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina. History Pre-independence (1903–1992) The game reached Bosnia and Herzegovina at the start of the 20th century, with Sarajevo (in 1903) and Mostar (in 1905) being the first cities to embrace it. Banja Luka, Tuzla, Zenica and Bihać were next along with numerous smaller towns as the sport spread. The country was under Austro-Hungarian rule when official competition began in 1908, though these activities were on a small scale within each territory.
