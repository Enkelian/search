Roman Catholic Diocese of Bayeux
The Roman Catholic Diocese of Bayeux and Lisieux (Latin: Dioecesis Baiocensis et Lexoviensis; French: Dioc√®se de Bayeux et Lisieux) is a diocese of the Roman Catholic Church in France. The diocese is coextensive with the Department of Calvados and is a suffragan to the Archdiocese of Rouen, which is also in Normandy. At the time of the Concordat of 1802, the ancient Diocese of Lisieux was united to that of Bayeux. A pontifical Brief, in 1854, authorized the Bishop of Bayeux to call himself Bishop of Bayeux and Lisieux. History A local legend, found in the breviaries of the 15th century, makes St. Exuperius to be an immediate disciple of St. Clement (Pope from 88 to 99), and thus the first Bishop of Bayeux. His see would therefore be a foundation of the 1st century. St. Regnobertus, the same legend tells us, was the successor of St. Exuperius. But the Bollandists, Jules Lair, and Louis Duchesne found no ground for this legend; it was only towards the end of the 4th century or beginning of the 5th century that Exuperius might have founded the See of Bayeux.Certain successors of St. Exuperius were honored as popular saints: Referendus, Rufinianus, and Lupus
