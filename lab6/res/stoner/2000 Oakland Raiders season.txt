2000 Oakland Raiders season
The 2000 Oakland Raiders season was the franchise's 31st season in the National Football League, the 41st overall, their fifth season since their return to Oakland, and the third season under head coach Jon Gruden. The Raiders finished the season 12–4, winning the AFC West for the first time since 1990. They returned to the playoffs for the first time since 1993, when the team was still in Los Angeles. And their Divisional Playoff game versus the Miami Dolphins would be their first home playoff game in Oakland since defeating the Houston Oilers in the 1980 AFC Wild Card Playoffs. As the No. 2 seed in the AFC, the Raiders received a bye into the divisional round of the playoffs. The Raiders held the Miami Dolphins scoreless, winning 27–0. The following week against the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Championship, starting quarterback Rich Gannon sustained a shoulder injury after being hit by Baltimore's Tony Siragusa early in the second quarter. The loss of Gannon was too steep to overcome as the Raiders lost 16–3. Siragusa was later fined $10,000 for the hit.
