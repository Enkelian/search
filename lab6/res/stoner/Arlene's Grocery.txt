History The former Puerto Rican bodega/grocery store (the facade of which remains) and neighboring butcher shop were turned into a bar in 1995. It hosts a variety of musical acts, although punk and hard rock bands tend to be most common. Local acts usually play at the venue, while their slightly "hipster" clientele often stay within the confines of the separate bar area. In the early 2000s, the venue hosted a popular all-ages matinee on Saturday afternoons, which was created and hosted by Lower East Side glam-punk band The Act.
