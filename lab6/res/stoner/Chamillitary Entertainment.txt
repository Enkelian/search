Chamillitary is an entertainment company owned and run by rapper Chamillionaire. It was distributed by Universal. It has since been an independent record label company. History Chamillitary Entertainment was founded in 2004 by Chamillionaire after he had left record labels; Swishahouse and Paid In Full Entertainment.Chamillionaire, alongside The Color Changin' Click, found themselves without a label home- after a falling out with Paul Wall, who returned to Swishahouse. In early 2004, Chamillionaire decided to form his own label; Chamillitary Entertainment. He signed his younger brother Rasaq to the label, as well as 50/50 Twin. Rasaq would eventually leave the label to pursue his own goals and 50/50 Twin left the label in 2006. Chamillionaire later signed Lil Ken to the label in 2007 along with R&B singer Tony Henry and Yung Ro. Yung Ro would eventually leave the label in late 2008 due to differences with Chamillionaire. The label has been independent since January 15, 2011. This is because Chamillionaire and Universal parted ways. Chamillionaire is currently working on his 3rd studio album Poison. While working on Poison, Chamillionaire has gone on to release various projects and singles. Artists Former artists Discography Albums 2005: The Sound of Revenge by Chamillionaire
