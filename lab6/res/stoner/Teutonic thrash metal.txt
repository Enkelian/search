Teutonic thrash metal
Teutonic thrash metal is a regional scene of thrash metal music that originated during the 1980s in Germany. Along with Bay Area thrash metal, East Coast thrash metal, and Brazilian thrash metal, it was one of the major scenes of thrash metal in the 1980s. Teutonic is a medieval term for Germanic people. History Two bands influential to early Teutonic thrash metal were Destruction, from Lörrach, and the Holy Moses, from Aachen. After hearing Venom, both bands soon changed their sound within a matter of weeks to their new and permanent sound. Other bands soon followed. In 1982, the Gelsenkirchen-based band Sodom released their first demo, Witching Metal. In their early days Sodom were highly influenced by the NWOBHM, to the point they credit being a trio to bands like Motörhead, Tank, Raven and Venom who also featured power trio line-ups. Their style featured raspy vocals, palm muted guitar riffs, and frantic double bass drumming. Only with the release of their second LP Persecution Mania and with guitarist Frank Blackfire's input to move away from their original sounds and themes they became a thrash metal band for good. Essen's Kreator formed and released its debut album Endless Pain in 1985.
