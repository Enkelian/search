Stack interchange
A stack interchange is a particular, free-flowing type of design for interchanges, meaning grade-separated road junctions. It is referred to as a directional interchange in the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets.In countries where one drives on the right, left turns are handled by semi-directional flyovers or under ramps. Vehicles first exit the main carriageway to the right, then complete the turn via a ramp that crosses both highways, eventually merging with the traffic turning right from the opposite side of the interchange. A stack interchange therefore has two pairs of left-turning ramps, which may be "stacked" in various configurations above or below the two interchanging highways. In countries where one drives on the left, the appearance of the junction is topologically identical, but traffic flows are reversed. Stacks eliminate the problems of weaving and have the highest vehicle capacity among different types of four-way interchanges. However, they require considerable and expensive construction work for their flyover ramps, as well as having a larger footprint. Stack interchanges are also widely considered to be an eyesore among residents of homes near existing or proposed interchanges, leading to considerable NIMBY opposition. Four-level
