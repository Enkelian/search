Adland
Adland is a website focusing on the advertising industry and an Internet archive of commercials. Adland incorporates advertising news, critical commentary on ads and the advertising industry, and archives of ads and ad campaigns, concentrating on television advertisements. In 2003, Variety described Adland as a "center for ad-related news and discussion". The website also hosts ads which have been banned or censored elsewhere. Adland is headquartered in Malta, though coverage is international. Adland also has a Twitter presence with nearly 150,000 followers. On September 19, 2019, the website completely moved out of web server host Vultr due to a copyright infringement situation regarding a Bridgestone commercial. Since January 2020, the website is currently active again with a completely different web server host.

The site also houses an archive of over forty years of Super Bowl commercials. Wappling describes
