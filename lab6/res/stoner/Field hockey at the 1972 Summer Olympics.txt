Field hockey at the 1972 Summer Olympics
The field hockey tournament at the 1972 Summer Olympics was the 12th edition of the field hockey event at the Summer Olympics.The West German victory was the first title by a European nation since 1920 but was marred by the behavior of Pakistani players, fans, and officials after losing the final. At the final whistle, Pakistani fans and officials invaded the pitch before assaulting West German police and stadium security, storming the tournament officials table and pouring a bucket of water over International Hockey Federation president Rene Frank, while the players destroyed their locker room and refused to wear their silver medals or face the West German flag as it was raised at the medal ceremony. The eleven Pakistani players were banned for life from their national team, but after a high-level apology, the ban was reduced to two years, and eight of them played at the 1976 Olympics.
