Mercedes-Benz CLK-Class
The Mercedes-Benz CLK-Class is a former series of mid-size or entry-level luxury coupés and convertibles produced by Mercedes-Benz between 1997 and 2010. Although its design and styling was derived from the E-Class, the mechanical underpinnings were based on the smaller C-Class, and was positioned between the Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class and CL-Class. It primarily competes with the BMW 3 Series Coupé and Audi A4 Cabriolet. In 2010, Mercedes moved the CLK-Class designation back to the E-Class, as it had been called previously. First generation (W208/C208; 1997–2003) The first-generation W208/C208 CLK was introduced in 1997, and was based on the W202 Mercedes-Benz C-Class launched three years earlier. The W208 coupé was replaced by the W209 CLK-Class in 2002 (for the 2003 model year), although the convertible remained in production until 2003 when replaced by the C209 CLK. History The CLK introduced a new market niche for Mercedes-Benz. Although the W208 used components from the E-Class (W210), aesthetic based on the E-Class and had a specification level higher than the E-Class, it was in fact based on the less expensive C-Class (W202) platform. Two versions were initially available: the four-cylinder CLK 200 (136 PS (100 kW; 134 bhp)) and four-cylinder supercharged CLK 230 Kompressor
