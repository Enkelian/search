Naloxonazine
Naloxonazine is a potent, irreversible μ-opioid receptor antagonist. Naloxonazine forms spontaneously in acidic solutions of naloxazone, and may be responsible for much or all of the irreversible μ opioid receptor binding displayed by the latter. See also Oxymorphone-3-methoxynaltrexonazine, a similar opioid also having two complete and mirrored morphinan carbon skeletons == References ==
