Gare de Fontainebleau–Avon Station
Fontainebleau–Avon is a railway station in Avon and Fontainebleau, Île-de-France, France. The station is located on the Paris–Marseille railway line. The station is served by Transilien (commuter) and TER (local) services operated by SNCF. The station was once served by the TGV a few years ago. The station is served by Transilien line R (Paris-Gare de Lyon). The station was designed by the architect François-Alexis Cendrier, one of many he worked on for the railroad company Chemins de fer de Paris à Lyon et à la Méditerranée. The station once benefited from a TGV journey to the Mediterranean Sea, with a train leaving for Marseille at 07.30 on a Saturday and returning on the Sunday evening, with a journey time is 4.30 hours. However, this is no longer the case.
