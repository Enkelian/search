Galvanization
Galvanization or galvanizing (also spelled galvanisation or galvanising) is the process of applying a protective zinc coating to steel or iron, to prevent rusting. The most common method is hot-dip galvanizing, in which the parts are submerged in a bath of molten hot zinc. Protective action Galvanizing protects the underlying iron or steel in the following main ways: The zinc coating, when intact, prevents corrosive substances from reaching the underlying steel or iron. The zinc protects iron by corroding first. For better results, application of chromates over zinc is also seen as an industrial trend. In the event the underlying metal becomes exposed, protection can continue as long as there is zinc close enough to be electrically coupled. After all of the zinc in the immediate area is consumed, localized corrosion of the base metal can occur. History and etymology The earliest known example of galvanized iron was encountered by Europeans on 17th-century Indian armour in the Royal Armouries Museum collection.The etymology of galvanisation is via French from the name of Italian scientist Luigi Galvani. However this is an obscure back-formation; Galvani had no involvement in zinc coating. The earliest use of the term was in late 18th-century scientific research
