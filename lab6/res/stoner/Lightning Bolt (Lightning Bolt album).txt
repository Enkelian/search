Lightning Bolt (Lightning Bolt album)
Lightning Bolt (also known as The Yellow Record or The Yellow Album) is the eponymous debut album by noise rock band Lightning Bolt. Originally, five of the tracks on the album were recorded in the studio, however, with the exception of one track, the band discarded these and instead put low fidelity live versions of the songs on the record. A 50-minute "companion cassette" entitled Zone was available for three dollars via direct mail order when the record was originally released. This material appears in the form of two bonus tracks included on the CD release. The original vinyl issue was limited to 750 copies and had the artwork that is represented on this page. The more common CD reissue contained slightly different artwork. Track listing All tracks are written by Lightning Bolt.
