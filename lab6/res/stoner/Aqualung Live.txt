Aqualung Live
Aqualung Live (2005) is a live album by Jethro Tull, a live performance of Aqualung before an audience of 40 invited guests at XM Studios in Washington, D.C.. The album was given away to ticket holders on almost all US concerts in October and November 2005. Royalties from the European release go to various charities for the homeless. The US release was on 7 March 2006. However, some copies had been sold prior to this in music stores, most likely due to concertgoers selling their copies.
