Wake Me When It's Over
Wake Me When It's Over is Faster Pussycat's second album, moving from the glam metal sound of their first album to a blues-influenced sound. In 1990, while on tour supporting this album, drummer Mark Michals was arrested for FedExing heroin to himself and subsequently fired from the band. Drummer Frankie Banali of Quiet Riot was hired to complete the concert tour. Banali was replaced after the tour by Brett Bradshaw who was discovered after exhaustive auditions. Music videos were produced for "Poison Ivy" and "House of Pain". "House of Pain" reached No. 28 in the Billboard Hot 100 and the video, which was directed by future film director Michael Bay, was in rotation on MTV. The album itself peaked at No. 48 in the Billboard 200.
