Gasoline Alley (album)
Gasoline Alley is the second solo studio album by the British singer-songwriter Rod Stewart. It was released in June 1970. It is included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. Originally released in the UK on the Vertigo label, it was re-mastered and re-issued in 2008 by Russian reissue label, Lilith Records Ltd. It is a collection of covers combined with Stewart's own compositions. Like many of Stewart's solo albums from the period, it featured significant musical contributions from the other members of his band Faces. Reception The album was well received, with Langdon Winner of Rolling Stone feeling that Stewart had "a rare sensitivity for the delicate moments in a person's existence", and that this, Stewart's second solo album, was the work "of a supremely fine artist".
