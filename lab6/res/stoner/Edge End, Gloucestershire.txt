Edge End, Gloucestershire
Edge End is a small hamlet in west Gloucestershire, England. Location and amenities Edge End is about 1.5 miles NW of Coleford and about 1 mile north of the Royal Forest of Dean College. Originally close to some mine workings, all of which have now closed, the hamlet consists of 62 private dwellings, with no pubs, shops or schools (the one village shop closed some time ago and is now a Bed and Breakfast establishment). The village is effectively split in half by a village green, which is co-owned by the residents and is maintained by contributions. On the green there is one goalpost and there used to be a small park but it has been taken way. Within the village live a mix of "Foresters", the original inhabitants, many of whom can trace their family lineage back through the village's history, and incomers from further afield. The community has a nice balance and there is a sense of community spirit evident here, with neighbours helping each other. From the village green, perched 600 ft above sea level, on a fine day you can see north for up to 50 miles or so into Shropshire, whilst the counties of Gloucestershire,
