The 1996 DEP Sessions
The 1996 DEP Sessions is a collaborative studio album by British musicians Tony Iommi and Glenn Hughes, released through Sanctuary and Mayan Records in 2004. Material for The 1996 DEP Sessions was originally recorded in 1996, and was circulated among fans as a bootleg recording dubbed Eighth Star, where two of the tracks were missing, but instead a track called "Shaking My Wings" was included, which did not feature Tony Iommi (its real name is "To Cry You A Song", still sung by Hughes but from the Jethro Tull tribute album A Collection Of Tull Tales). The album title "The 1996 DEP Sessions" reflects the fact that the tracks were recorded in the DEP International Studios in Digbeth, Birmingham. The album's drum tracks were originally performed by ex-Judas Priest drummer Dave Holland, who was convicted of attempted rape several years later. Iommi had the drum tracks re-recorded by Jimmy Copley eight years later, as he did not want the album to be associated with a sex offender.
