Anshar
In the Babylonian creation myth Enuma Elish, Anshar (also spelled Anšar), which means "whole heaven", is a primordial god. His consort is Kishar which means "Whole Earth". They were the children of Lahamu and Lahmu and the grandchildren of Tiamat and Apsû. They, in turn, are the parents of Anu, the god of heaven, lord of constellations, king of gods, spirits and demons.During the Neo-Assyrian period, Anshar was often equated with Ashur, the patron deity and namesake of the Assyrian Empire.
