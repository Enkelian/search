Lacquer Head
"Lacquer Head" is the first single from Primus' 1999 album, Antipop. The song features three verses that tell the tale of three different children, and the harm that comes to them from their huffing of inhalants. MTV banned the single's music video for its drug references and purportedly 'violent content', despite the negative portrayal of the use of inhalants. This song was produced by Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst. While producing the track, Durst encouraged the band to return to the more aggressive sound of their earlier albums for Antipop. Charts "Lacquer Head" received some airplay after its release, especially after the video was banned by MTV. Because of this, it grew in popularity.
