Landes (department)
The Landes (French pronunciation: ​[lɑ̃d]; Gascon: Lanas [ˈlanəs]) is a department in southwestern France and in the south half of the region Nouvelle-Aquitaine. History Landes is one of the original 83 departments that were created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790. It was created from parts of the provinces of Guyenne and Gascony. During the first part of the nineteenth century large parts of the department were covered with poorly drained heathland (lande in French) which is the origin of its name. The vegetation covered rich soil and was periodically burned off, leaving excellent pasturage for sheep, which around 1850 are thought to have numbered between 900,000 and 1,000,000 in this area. The sheep were managed by shepherds who moved around on stilts and became proficient at covering long distances thus supported. Most of the sheep departed during the second half of the nineteenth century when systematic development of large pine plantations transformed the landscape and the local economy. One of the most famous citizens of the Landes was the nineteenth-century French economist Frederic Bastiat. The Nobel Prize–winning novelist François Mauriac set his novels in the Landes. Geography The Landes is part of the current region of Nouvelle-Aquitaine
