AXS (pronounced access) is a digital marketing platform for purchasing tickets for sports and entertainment events in the United States, and internationally. It was developed and is operated by Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG) in partnership with Outbox Technologies. In September 2019, AEG bought out Outbox's partnership and AXS is now a wholly owned subsidiary of AEG. Background The initial AXS deployment was August 2011 and venues and services have been added in a phased roll out. As of August 2013, AXS was the exclusive or the primary ticket provider for over 30 US venues and 9 UK venues. The first Staples Center concert available only through AXS was Beyonc√© in 2013; both Los Angeles Lakers and the Los Angeles Clippers are still using Ticketmaster. The white label technology Outbox developed enables AEG to sell tickets under either the AXS brand name or under local venue name brands, which have considerable local support, while providing centralized CRM services for either approach.In January 2014, AEG announced that AXS had purchased Examiner.com, a user generated news site, in order to leverage the site's entertainment content.
