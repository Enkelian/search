UD Salamanca
Unión Deportiva Salamanca, S.A.D. (Spanish pronunciation: [uˈnjon depoɾˈtiβa salaˈmaŋka]) was a Spanish football team based in Salamanca, in the autonomous community of Castile and León. Founded on 16 March 1923 and nicknamed Los Charros, the club played in white shirts and black shorts, holding home games at Estadio El Helmántico, which seated 17,341 spectators. History Initially formed by Irish students, Salamanca first played in early Spanish championships in 1907, before an official league was founded later on. On 16 March 1923, at the tables of Café Novelty, situated in the Plaza Mayor, Dionisio Ridruejo set the club's early official foundations and, from 1939 and during the following three decades, it fluctuated between the third and the second levels of the Spanish football league. In the 1974–75 season, Salamanca made its La Liga debuts, overachieving for a final 7th position (out of 18 teams), which eventually would be its best classification ever. The team lasted in the topflight until 1981, mainly coached by José Luis García Traid, then returned the following year for a further two seasons, being further relegated to Segunda División B – the new third division created in 1977 – in 1984–85, and spending three years in that
