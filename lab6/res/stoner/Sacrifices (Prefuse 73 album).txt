Reception Sylvester awarded the album a 7 out of 10 in Exclaim!, noting that "much of Sacrifices, including several of the album's under-one-minute tracks, borrow too much from Herren's early work, there simply so much to love about the simplicity of Herren's new material." and that it was "simply refreshing to hear Herren sound uncomplicated, uniform and so focused." Mehan Jayasuriya of Pitchfork gave the album a 5.9 out of ten, noting that the songs on Sacrifices "feel slight, with songs that too often fade into the background".
