Face Stabber
Face Stabber is the twenty-second studio album by American garage rock band Oh Sees, released on August 16, 2019 on Castle Face Records. The album expands on the progressive rock sound that the band explored on their two previous releases Orc and Smote Reverser, and features the longest studio track the band has released, the 21-minute "Henchlock". Background The band described the album's sound as "Soundcloud hip-hop reversed, a far flung nemesis of contemporary country and flaccid algorithmic pop-barf".
