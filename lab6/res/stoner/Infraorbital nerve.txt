Infraorbital nerve
After the maxillary nerve enters the infraorbital canal, the nerve is frequently called the infraorbital nerve. This nerve innervates (sensory) the lower eyelid, upper lip, and part of the nasal vestibule and exits the infraorbital foramen of the maxilla. There is a cross innervation of this nerve on the other side of jaw. Clinical relevance The infraorbital nerve block is a type of local anesthetic nerve block used to induce analgesia in the distribution of the nerve for whatever purpose. After a fracture of the floor of the orbit, the infraorbital nerve may become trapped, producing an area of anaesthesia under the orbital rim.
