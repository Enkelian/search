Bernd Krauss
Bernd Krauss (born 8 May 1957 in Dortmund) is a retired German-Austrian football player and later a football manager. His most recent spell he had as technical director and head coach of Tunisian club Étoile Sportive du Sahel in 2012. Playing career Club career Krauss started his professional career at local outfit Borussia Dortmund but limited chances there made him move to Austrian Bundesliga side Rapid Wien in 1977. The move proved to be successful, winning the league title (twice) and the domestic cup. He only returned to Germany in 1983 to join Borussia Mönchengladbach where he finished his playing career and took up a coaching post. International career The German-born Krauss was tempted to become an Austrian citizen when playing at Rapid Wien and joined Austria's national team set-up. He made his debut for Austria in 1981 and was a participant at the 1982 FIFA World Cup. He earned 22 caps, no goals scored – however, he did score an own goal rather tellingly against West Germany in a game on 29 April 1981 that ended 0–2. He already played his final international match in 1984, after he left Austria to play in his native West Germany again. Coaching
