1999 Oakland Raiders season
The 1999 Oakland Raiders season was the franchise's 30th season in the National Football League, the 40th overall, their 4th season since their return to Oakland, and the second season under head coach Jon Gruden. They matched their previous season's output of 8–8. Thirteen of the team's sixteen games were decided by a touchdown or less, and none of the Raiders' eight losses were by more than a touchdown. The season saw the team acquire quarterback Rich Gannon, who had his best seasons with the Raiders, being named MVP in 2002 and leading the team to a Super Bowl, that same season. His following two seasons after the Super Bowl were ruined by injuries and he was forced to retire in 2004. Gannon was named to four consecutive Pro Bowls (1999–2002) while playing for the Raiders.
