2013 Oakland Raiders season
The 2013 Oakland Raiders season was the franchise's 44th season in the National Football League, the 54th overall and the second under head coach Dennis Allen. With a 4â€“12 record, the Raiders secured their eleventh consecutive non-winning season, and missed the playoffs for an eleventh consecutive season. The Raiders entered the season with a new quarterback in Terrelle Pryor. Pryor started off the season in impressive fashion, with the team almost pulling off the upset in Week 1 against the Indianapolis Colts, and defeating the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 2. The team and Pryor eventually cooled down, resulting in Pryor being benched for Matt McGloin in the game against the Houston Texans. Before this game, history was made in the game against the Philadelphia Eagles when Eagles quarterback Nick Foles threw 7 touchdown passes, the most passing touchdowns the Raiders had ever allowed in its history. Prior to the season starting, the Raiders brought back defensive back Charles Woodson, who spent the last 7 years with the Green Bay Packers. 2013 draft class Notes ^[a] The Raiders traded their first-round selection (No. 3 overall) to the Miami Dolphins in exchange for the Dolphins' first- (No. 12 overall) and second- (No.
