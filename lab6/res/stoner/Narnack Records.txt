Narnack Records
Narnack Records is an independent record label founded in 2002. The label developed in New York Cityâ€™s underground music scene and quickly became known for its ability for developing new artists, while also working with established bands like the Fall and the Slits. Narnack became home for a diversified group of musicians working with a wide variety of artists, from garage rock, alternative and punk to Americana, folk and dub/reggae. In the spring of 2007, the company relocated from New York to Los Angeles, where it teamed up with Lionsgate Films for distribution. In its new residence, Narnack began a publishing division, Narnack Music Publishing, with a catalog of over 300 songs from past and present artists as well as composers. After a short stint with Lionsgate, Narnack moved to TVT/The Orchard for both physical and digital distribution. In 2008, Lee "Scratch" Perry brought Narnack a Grammy nomination for Best Reggae Album with Repentance.
