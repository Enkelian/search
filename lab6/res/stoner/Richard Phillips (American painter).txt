Richard Phillips (American painter)
Richard Phillips (born 1962) is an American artist. He was born in Marblehead, Massachusetts, and lives in New York City. In the 1990s he worked at the Guggenheim Museum as an art handler. He paints in a photo-realistic or hyper-realistic style. Phillips created a Sasha Grey short film for the Gagosian Gallery in 2011, and a Sasha Grey portrait for the Frieze Art Fair in 2013. In 2013 he collaborated with Playboy magazine to create a roadside installation near Marfa, Texas: he mounted a black-painted 1970s muscle car on an inclined concrete plinth beside a large symbol from the magazine. The installation was later moved. Phillips's first exhibition in a museum was at Dallas Contemporary in 2014. == References ==
