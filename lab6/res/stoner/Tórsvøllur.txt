Tórsvøllur
Tórsvøllur is a football stadium on the sport site of Gundadalur in Tórshavn, the capital of the Faroe Islands. The stadium holds 5000 people, and was built in 1999 to become the country's national stadium to provide an artificial grass surface on which international football matches could be played. Previously, the Faroe Islands national team played its home matches in the town of Toftir at Svangaskarð stadium. In August 2011 floodlights were introduced; these were first officially used for the football match between Faroe Islands and Italy on 2 September 2011. A total renovation of the stadium, the first since it was built, is expected to be completed by 2021.The renovation includes a new west stand with a media room, dressing room and 1500 capacity, meaning the stadium will hold 5000 people, nearly 10% of the whole country's population.
