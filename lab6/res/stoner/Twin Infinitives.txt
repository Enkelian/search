Twin Infinitives
Twin Infinitives is the second studio album by Royal Trux. It was released as a double LP in 1990 by Drag City, then reissued on CD and cassette in 1994. Twin Infinitives is the first full-length album released under Chicago independent label Drag City. Twin Infinitives is noted for its deconstructed arrangements, unorthodox vocals and dense production; all were extremes rarely visited to the same degrees on Royal Trux's later releases.
