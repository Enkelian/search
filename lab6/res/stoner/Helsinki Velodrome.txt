Helsinki Velodrome
Helsinki Velodrome (Finnish: Helsingin Velodromi) is an outdoor velodrome and american football stadium in Helsinki, Finland. The protected functionalist concrete building was designed by Hilding Ekelund. History It was built in 1938–1940 for the 1940 Summer Olympics which were cancelled due to World War II. After the war, it was a venue of the 1952 Summer Olympics for the track cycling and field hockey events. The Velodrome hosted the four-track cycling events and the whole field hockey event for the Olympics. The original building was deemed inadequate during the games and additional space was quickly erected to accommodate the athletes and press. Some temporary seating was also constructed for additional capacity.Before the renovation of 1997–2000, the center area had a natural grass pitch and was used for soccer, hosting local teams like Ponnistus, Käpylän Pallo and Atlantis FC. Docomomo has listed it as a significant example of modern architecture in Finland. Usage Cycling The cycling track is 400 meters in length and is used for most national events. The banking in the bends is 37.5˚ and 16˚ on the straights. The length of the track and the lack of built safety measures make the track unsuitable for international cycling competitions.
