Blast First also issued the song as a 7" single in edited form, retitled "Flower (Anti-Fuckword Radio Edit)"), with a backwards version, "Rewolf (Special Natas Mix)", on the flipside."Flower", "Halloween" and "Satan Is Boring" were all later included on the Geffen Records CD reissue of Sonic Youth's 1985 album Bad Moon Rising. Background "Flower" and "Halloween" were recorded and mixed at Radio Tokyo in Venice, California in January 1985. "Satan Is Boring" was a collage of live material recorded at concerts in Rotterdam and Aylesbury in April 1985.
