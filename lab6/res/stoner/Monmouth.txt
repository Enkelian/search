Monmouth ( MON-m…ôth, MUN-; Welsh: Trefynwy meaning "town on the Monnow") is the historic county town of Monmouthshire in Wales and also a community. Situated where the River Monnow joins the River Wye, 2 miles (3.2 km) of the border with England. The town is 30 miles (48 km) northeast of Cardiff, and 113 miles (182 km) west of London. It is within the Monmouthshire local authority, and the parliamentary constituency of Monmouth. Monmouth's population in the 2011 census was 10,508, rising from 8,877 in 2001. The town was the site of a small Roman fort, Blestium, and became established after the Normans built a castle here after 1067. Its medieval stone gated bridge is the only one of its type remaining in Britain. The castle later came into the possession of the House of Lancaster, and was the birthplace of King Henry V in 1387. In 1536, it became the county town of Monmouthshire. A market town and a focus of educational and cultural activities for the surrounding rural area, Monmouth has become a tourism centre at the heart of the Wye Valley.
