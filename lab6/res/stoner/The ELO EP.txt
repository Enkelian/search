The ELO EP
The ELO EP is the first extended play (EP) from Electric Light Orchestra and was their final release of 1978. It was a seven-inch EP played at 45 revolutions per minute and was released in the UK and Ireland only to promote the three-LP box set Three Light Years. "Can't Get It Out of My Head" was the lead-off track and had originally appeared on the band's fourth album Eldorado. It thus finally became a hit in their homeland, nearly four years after it had charted in the US. The other three tracks had already been UK hit singles.
