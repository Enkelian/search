City Slang
City Slang is an independent record label based in Berlin, Germany. History The label was founded in 1990 by former tour agent Christof Ellinghaus, exclusively to release The Flaming Lipsâ€™ In A Priest Driven Ambulance (With Silver Sunshine Stares). With bands The Lemonheads, Das Damen, and Yo La Tengo also looking for a label to release their 1990 albums, City Slang became, almost by chance, a home for US bands looking to bring their music to the European market. It was named after the song "City Slang" by Sonic's Rendezvous Band. Over the past 22 years, City Slang has played host to releases ranging from veteran acts to newcomers. Its focus on US- and Canada-based acts remains, maintaining its relationship with several key North American independent labels, such as Merge Records and Arts & Crafts.
