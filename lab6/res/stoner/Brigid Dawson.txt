Brigid Dawson
Brigid Dawson sang and played keyboard and tambourine for Thee Oh Sees. She is noted for her "whimsical" harmonies and is credited with helping front man John Dwyer write melodies. Reviewing a show they played in New York, Impose Magazine wrote, "Brigid Dawson's backing vocals are the band's silver lining". Soundscapes noted in an album review, "Once again, Dwyerâ€™s secret weapon is Brigid Dawson, whose vocal interplay gives them a leg-up in the male-dominated garage rock scene." Her voice has been compared to Kim Deal and Exene Cervenka, among others. Brigid occasionally performed as "Mix Tapes" with Meric Long of The Dodos. She is a UK native by way of San Marin.
