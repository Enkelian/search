Track listing "Green Sky Green Lake" – 5:42 "Everything's Goin On" – 3:15 "Good Moanin'" – 4:47 "Sleepy Silver Door" – 7:29 "Beyond the Fields We Know" – 9:26 "Dusty Nothing" – 4:06 "Lady" – 4:46 "Rocky Mountain High" – 7:27 Critical Reception AllMusic gave a positive review of the mix of sludge and drift. There was a notable difference between the usual studio-recording style and the live style used for the album. The reviewer summarised it as "trippy in the best sense of the word, as Simon's vocals cascade over the band's full shuffling downward slide". Exclaim!'s review was mixed, though positive, noting the vocals of the psych-rock would either be loved or hated by listeners, though the general quality was appreciated. == References ==
