Trouble Man (song)
"Trouble Man" is a song composed and written by American recording artist Marvin Gaye released on the Motown subsidiary, Tamla, in November of 1972. The song was the title track and theme of the blaxploitation film of the same name. Relating the song to the travails of the movie's leading character, named "Mister T", and also relating to issues in his private life, Gaye called it one of the most honest recordings he ever made. He played drums and piano on the record as well as performing all the vocals himself, in which he sings most of the song in falsetto while reaching a gospel-styled growl during the bridges of the song. The performances of the song during Gaye's later concerts became one of his highlights during his 1970s and early 1980s tours. The song was also used as two instrumental "theme songs" on the accompanying album, in which Gaye played synthesizers to accompany saxophone solos from his musicians. Gaye also recorded a slightly different version of the song primarily for the movie's opening, in which he sang in both tenor and falsetto. The album version of the song was the only one released as a single in November 1972
