Enosis
Enosis (Greek: Ένωσις, IPA: [ˈenosis], "union") is the movement of various Greek communities that live outside Greece, for incorporation of the regions they inhabit into the Greek state. The idea of enosis is related to the Megali Idea, an irredentist concept of a Greek state which dominated Greek politics following the creation of the modern Greek state in 1830. The Megali Idea was a project which called for the annexation of all ethnic Greek lands, parts of which had participated in the Greek War of Independence in the 1820s but which were unsuccessful and remained under foreign rule. A widely known example of enosis is the movement within the Greek-Cypriot community for a union of Cyprus into Greece. The idea of enosis in British-ruled Cyprus became associated with the campaign for Cypriot self-determination, especially among the island's Greek Cypriot majority. However, many within the Turkish Cypriot population opposed enosis without taksim (the partitioning of the island between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots). In 1960, the Republic of Cyprus was born, but this did not result either in enosis nor taksim. Around this time, Cypriot intercommunal violence was occurring in response to the different objectives, and the continuing desire for enosis
