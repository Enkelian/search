There is Nothing New Under the Sun
There is Nothing New Under the Sun is an EP by Missouri band Coalesce which features the band covering songs by Led Zeppelin, which was originally released on May 18, 1999 through Hydra Head Records. In 2007, the recording was re-released by Hydra Head Records, which included the full original EP with re-recorded vocal tracks, a new master and all of the Coalesce tracks from their split EPs with The Get Up Kids, Today is the Day and Boy Sets Fire. The initial idea behind the covers album was to not only emulate Garage Days Re-Revisited, a Metallica album composed of covers, but to also allow for guitarist Jes Steineger to establish a musical connection with his father, as he was a fan of Led Zeppelin.
