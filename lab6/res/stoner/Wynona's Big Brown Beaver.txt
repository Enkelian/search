Track listing "Wynona's Big Brown Beaver" – 4:23 "Hello Skinny/Constantinople" – 4:44 (originally by The Residents) "Hellbound 17½ (Theme From)" – 2:59 "Have a Cigar" – 5:26 (originally by Pink Floyd) (only available on German edition of the single) Music and lyrics The song epitomizes Primus' musical eccentricities, wherein the group's signature funk metal stylings are inflected with a sound vaguely reminiscent of bluegrass and southern rock. During the song's guitar solos, Larry LaLonde's playing shifts from "noise" guitar in the first solo to a country-sounding technique and banjo-style finger-picking on the second (inspired by The Grateful Dead late singer/guitarist Jerry Garcia). The song's lyrics constitute an absurd, rambling tale about a woman named Wynona and her "beaver". They combine sexual double entendre in "beaver"
