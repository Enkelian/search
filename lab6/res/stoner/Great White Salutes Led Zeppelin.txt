Great White Salutes Led Zeppelin
Great Zeppelin: A Tribute to Led Zeppelin is a cover album released by the American hard rock band Great White in 1998, dedicated to songs of Led Zeppelin. It was recorded live in a concert that took place at The Galaxy Theatre of Santa Ana, California, USA, in December 1996 and released by the French label Axe Killer. The American edition was issued by Deadline Records in 1999. Deadline Records also issued a very rare vinyl version of the album in 1999, omitting 4 tracks due to time limitations of vinyl. Songs from this album appear on many compilations and also on re-issues of older albums as bonus tracks. The album was re-issued in 2005 by the Canadian label Legacy, with the title Great White Salutes Led Zeppelin. The entire album appears also on Great White's double-CD compilation A Double Dose issued by Deadline Music in 2005, along with the album of covers Recover.
