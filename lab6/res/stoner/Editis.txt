Editis
Editis is a French group of publishing companies, subsidiary of French group Vivendi. It is the second-largest French publishing group, after Hachette Livre. History Editis was created in January 2004 by the regrouping of approximately 60% of the publishing assets of Vivendi, the other part remaining with Lagardère Group.Editis was, for 4 years (until May 2008), part of Wendel, a financial investment group which had acquired it from Investima10 (a financial ad hoc structure holding Vivendi Universal Publishing assets after Lagardère's purchase in 2003). Wendel purchased this group of publishers for about €400 million plus debt, and sold it to Planeta for about €960 million, realizing a profit. In May 2008, Editis integrated with the Planeta Group, the main Spanish-speaking publisher. In January 2019, Vivendi reacquired Editis from Planeta for €900m.
