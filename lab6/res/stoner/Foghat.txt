The band has achieved eight gold records, one platinum and one double platinum record, and despite several line-up changes, continue to record and perform. History 1970s The band initially featured Dave Peverett ("Lonesome Dave") on guitar and vocals, Tony Stevens on bass and Roger Earl on drums, after all three musicians left Savoy Brown in 1971. Rod Price, on guitar/slide guitar, joined after he left Black Cat Bones in December 1970. The new line-up was named "Foghat" (a nonsense word from a Scrabble-like game played by Peverett and his brother) in January 1971. There is a cartoon drawing on the back cover of the group's first album of a head wearing a foghat. Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin wore a white foghat for a short time during 1970 in concert. Foghat relocated to the United States after signing a deal with Bearsville Records. Their debut album, Foghat (1972), was produced by Dave Edmunds and featured a cover of Willie Dixon's "I Just Want to Make Love to You", which received considerable airplay, especially on FM
