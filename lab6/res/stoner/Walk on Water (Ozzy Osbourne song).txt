Walk on Water (Ozzy Osbourne song)
Prince of Darkness is a box set of four CDs by Ozzy Osbourne released in 2005. The first two CDs are Osbourne's solo work containing various studio recordings, live tracks, b-sides, demos and outtakes, and the last two CDs are collaborations on disc three and cover songs on disc four. The cover versions were recorded for this box set compilation, but were released on a stand-alone album entitled Under Cover later in the year. Note on album tracks from Blizzard of Ozz and Diary of a Madman: The album tracks are from the 2002 remasters, for which Blizzard of Ozz and Diary of a Madman were partially re-recorded. The original drum and bass tracks were replaced with recordings by Osbourne's then-current bassist Robert Trujillo and drummer Mike Bordin, as a management response to legal action by original bassist Bob Daisley and drummer Lee Kerslake for unpaid royalty fees.
