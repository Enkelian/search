Institut National Agronomique Paris-Grignon
The Institut National Agronomique Paris-Grignon (INA P-G) was a French university-level institution of grande école-type. It offered master's degree in agricultural- and life sciences. It was created in 1971 by merging the Institut national agronomique (Paris) and the École nationale supérieure d'Agronomie de Grignon, thus having a history that goes back to 1826. INA P-G disappeared as an administrative entity on January 1, 2007, along with ENSIA and ENGREF, to create AgroParisTech.
