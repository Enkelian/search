Mount Tamalpais
Mount Tamalpais (; TAM-əl-PY-iss; Coast Miwok: /t̪ɑmɑlˈpɑis̺/, known locally as Mount Tam) is a peak in Marin County, California, United States, often considered symbolic of Marin County. Much of Mount Tamalpais is protected within public lands such as Mount Tamalpais State Park, the Marin Municipal Water District watershed, and National Park Service land, such as Muir Woods. Geography Mount Tamalpais is the highest peak in the Marin Hills, which are part of the Northern California Coast Ranges. The elevation at the West Peak, where a radar dome currently stands, is between 2,560 feet (780 m) and 2,580 feet (786 m). It stood over 2,600 feet (792 m) before the summit was flattened for the radar dome construction. The East Peak is at 2,571 feet (784 m). The East Peak was considered the highest point in the county, but now that claim is being disputed by those who believe the west peak is higher. But there is no corroboration of the claim on behalf of west peak from USGS or any other official body. The site ListsOfJohn has marked the west peak to be higher, but added a footnote that the east peak may be higher since the west peak summit
