Chevrolet Cruze
The Chevrolet Cruze is a compact car that has been made by the Chevrolet division of General Motors since 2008. The nameplate has been used previously in Japan, for a version of a subcompact hatchback car produced under a joint venture with Suzuki from 2001 to 2007, and was based on the Suzuki Ignis. Since 2009, the Cruze nameplate has designated a globally developed, designed, and manufactured four-door compact sedanâ€”complemented by a five-door hatchback body variant (in 2010 it also replaced the Chevrolet Cobalt) from 2011, and a station wagon in 2012. The Cruze was actually released earlier in 2008 to the South Korean market under the name Daewoo Lacetti Premiere until the phasing out of the Daewoo brand in favor of Chevrolet in 2011. In Australia, the model has been on sale since 2009 as the Holden Cruze. This new generation Cruze does not serve as a replacement for the Suzuki-derived Japanese market predecessor. Instead, it replaces three other compact models: the Chevrolet Optra sold internationally under various names (such as the Suzuki Forenza in the United States, Chevrolet Optra in Latin America and Canada, Chevrolet/Daewoo Lacetti in Europe and Asia), the Chevrolet Cobalt, sold exclusively in North America,
