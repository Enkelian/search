Crimean Tatars
Crimean Tatars (Crimean Tatar: qırımtatarlar, къырымтатарлар), or Crimeans (Crimean Tatar: qırımlar, къырымлар), are a Turkic ethnic group and nation, who are an indigenous people of Crimea. The formation of Crimean Tatars occurred during the 13th–17th centuries, primarily from Cumans that appeared in Crimea in the 10th century, with strong contributions from all the peoples who ever inhabited Crimea. Since 2014, Crimean Tatars have been officially recognized as an indigenous people of Ukraine. The Russian Federation defines them as an "indigenous people", as opposite to a "national minority".Crimean Tatars constituted the majority of Crimea's population from the time of ethnogenesis until the mid-19th century, and the largest ethnic population until the end of the 19th century. Almost immediately after the retaking of Crimea from Axis forces, in May 1944, the USSR State Defense Committee ordered the deportation of all of the Crimean Tatars from Crimea, including the families of Crimean Tatars serving in the Soviet Army. The deportees were transported in trains and boxcars to Central Asia, primarily to Uzbekistan. Starting in 1967, some were allowed to return, and in 1989 the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union condemned the removal of Crimean Tatars from their motherland as inhumane and lawless.
