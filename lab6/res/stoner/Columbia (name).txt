Columbia (name)
Columbia (; kə-LUM-bee-ə) is the female personification of the United States. It was also a historical name applied to the Americas and to the New World. The association has given rise to the names of many persons, places, objects, institutions and companies; for example: Columbia University, the District of Columbia (the national capital of the United States), and the ship Columbia Rediviva, which would give its name to the Columbia River. Images of the Statue of Liberty (erected in 1886) largely displaced personified Columbia as the female symbol of the United States by around 1920, although Lady Liberty was seen as an aspect of Columbia. The District of Columbia takes its name after the personification, as does the traditional patriotic hymn "Hail Columbia", which is the official vice-presidential anthem of the United States Vice President. Columbia is a New Latin toponym, in use since the 1730s with reference to the thirteen (or more) colonies of British America. It originated from the name of Italian explorer Christopher Columbus and from the ending -ia, common in Latin names of countries (paralleling Britannia, Gallia, and others). History Early The earliest type of personification of the Americas, seen in European art from the 16th
