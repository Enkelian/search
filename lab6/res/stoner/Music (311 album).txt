Music (311 album)
Music is the debut studio album by Omaha alternative rock band 311. It was released on February 9, 1993. "Do You Right" was released as a single. The album was certified Gold in 1999 by the RIAA, having sold over 500,000 copies. Background There are only five tracks that were not included on 311's previous independent releases; "Visit", "Paradise", "Hydroponic", "My Stoney Baby", and "Fat Chance". However, all of the songs that had been previously released were altered, most notably "Do You Right", where nearly all of the lyrics were changed. SA also changed his main verses in "Freak Out", "Feels So Good" and "Fuck The Bullshit". The breakdown in "Plain" was completely changed musically, and the lyrics were re-arranged. The first pressing was originally manufactured and distributed by "Warner Bros. Records Inc." and thus bears the "WB" logo in the bottom right corner. Later issues were manufactured and distributed by "RED" in 1994, "Mercury Records" in 1996 and most recently "Volcano". The song "My Stoney Baby" has been featured in the 2008 film Harold & Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay.
