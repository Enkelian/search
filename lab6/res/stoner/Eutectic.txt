Eutectic
A eutectic system ( yoo-TEK-tik) from the Greek "εύ" (eu = well) and "τήξις" (tēxis = melting) is a homogeneous mixture of substances that melts or solidifies at a single temperature that is lower than the melting point of any of the constituents.The eutectic temperature is the lowest possible melting temperature over all of the mixing ratios for the involved component species. Upon heating any other mixture ratio, and reaching the eutectic temperature – see the adjacent phase diagram – one component's lattice will melt first, while the temperature of the mixture has to further increase for (all) the other component lattice(s) to melt. Conversely, as a non-eutectic mixture cools down, each mixture's component will solidify (form its lattice) at a distinct temperature, until all material is solid. The coordinates defining a eutectic point on a phase diagram are the eutectic percentage ratio (on the atomic/molecular ratio axis of the diagram) and the eutectic temperature (on the temperature axis of the diagram).Not all binary alloys have eutectic points because the valence electrons of the component species are not always compatible, in any mixing ratio, to form a new type of joint crystal lattice. For example, in the silver-gold system the
