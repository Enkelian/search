Bring On the Rain
"Bring On the Rain" is a song written by Billy Montana and Helen Darling, and recorded by American country music artist Jo Dee Messina. It was released in September 2001 as the fourth single from her album Burn. In March 2002, it became Messina's fifth number one country single, and her highest entry on the Adult Contemporary charts. Content "Bring On the Rain" is a mid-tempo country pop ballad. In it, the narrator tells that she has had a bad day, but is not let down by it, and is ready for another day as well: "Tomorrow's another day / And I'm thirsty anyway / So bring on the rain." Tim McGraw sings background vocals throughout. Messina said that, from the first listen, she "loved" the song, and thought that its message would resonate well, considering that it was released a day before the September 11 attacks. After the song had peaked, her fan club received an e-mail from a woman whose daughter was undergoing chemotherapy. In the letter, the mother explained that her daughter quoted the chorus to her. It was used on the Touched by an Angel episode Bring On the Rain. Awards "Bring on the Rain" received
