Education in Greece
Education in Greece at all levels is centralized by the Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs (Υ.ΠΑΙ.Θ.). The Ministry exercises control over public schools, formulates and implements legislation, administers the budget, coordinates national level university entrance examinations, sets up the national curriculum, appoints public school teaching staff, and coordinates other services. The national supervisory role of the Ministry is exercised through Regional Unit Public Education Offices which are named Regional Directorates of Primary and Secondary School Education. Public schools and the supply of textbooks are funded by the government. About 25% of postgraduate programmes offer free tuition, while about 30% of students are eligible to attend programmes tuition-free based on individual criteria. Formal education in Greece comprises three educational stages. The first stage of formal education is the Primary stage (Δημοτικό, six years, ages 6 to 12), followed by the Secondary stage which separates into two sub-stages: the compulsory Gymnasio (Γυμνάσιο, three years, ages 12 to 15) and non-compulsory Lyceum (Λύκειο, three years, ages 15 to 18). The third stage involves higher education. School holidays in Greece include Christmas, Greek Independence Day, Easter, National Anniversary Day, a three-month summer holiday, National Public Holidays, and local holidays which vary by region
