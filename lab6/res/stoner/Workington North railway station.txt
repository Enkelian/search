Workington North railway station
Workington North railway station was a temporary railway station in Cumbria, United Kingdom, constructed following floods which cut all road access to Workington town centre from north of the River Derwent. The station was located 1 mile (1.6 km) north of Workington station on the Cumbrian Coast Line. Until the new station opened, the closest station north of the River Derwent was Flimby railway station, which saw its passenger numbers increase enormously after the floods. Flimby had seen as many passengers on 24 November 2009 as would usually use the station in a fortnight. When the station first opened access to Workington by road from Northside involved a journey of 30 miles (48 km) because the bridges over the River Derwent for the A596 and A597 roads were destroyed or badly damaged by the flood. The construction of a temporary road bridge over the Derwent made vehicular access easier but the railway station remained open until 8 October 2010, when the last train called. Construction Network Rail began construction of the new station during the night of 24/25 November 2009. The station featured two platforms linked by a footbridge, a waiting room, and a gravel car park. Network Rail agreed
