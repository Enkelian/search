KVEA
KVEA, virtual channel 52 (UHF digital channel 25), is a Telemundo owned-and-operated television station serving Los Angeles, California, United States. Licensed to Corona, it is the Spanish-language network's West Coast flagship station. KVEA is owned by the Telemundo Station Group subsidiary of NBCUniversal (itself a subsidiary of Comcast), as part of a duopoly with Los Angeles-licensed NBC West Coast flagship KNBC (channel 4). The two stations share studios on Lankershim Boulevard in Universal City; KVEA's transmitter is located atop Mount Wilson. History KVEA first went on the air on June 29, 1966 as independent station KMTW-TV. The station was founded by Mount Wilson Broadcasting, which planned to expand into the television market. Mount Wilson Broadcasting sold the station's license to Kaiser Broadcasting (which owned UHF independents in several large media markets) before KMTW's debut. It was the third commercial UHF station in Los Angeles, after KIIX-TV (channel 22, now KWHY-TV) and KMEX-TV (channel 34). Kaiser changed channel 52's call letters to KBSC-TV, standing for "Kaiser Broadcasting Southern California" (the KMTW call sign is currently used by a MyNetworkTV affiliate in Wichita, Kansas). KBSC was never a serious competitor against established independents KTLA (channel 5), KHJ-TV (channel 9, now KCAL-TV), KTTV
