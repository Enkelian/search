Decommunization
Decommunization is the process of dismantling the legacies of communist state establishments, culture, and psychology in the post-communist states. It is sometimes referred to as political cleansing. The term is most commonly applied to the former countries of the Eastern Bloc and the post-Soviet states to describe a number of legal and social changes during their periods of postcommunism. In some states, decommunization includes bans on communist symbols. While sharing common traits, the processes of decommunization have run differently in different states.
