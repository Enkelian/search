Darker My Love
Darker My Love was a psychedelic rock band based in Los Angeles, California. Guitarist/vocalist Tim Presley, a former member of the hardcore punk band The Nerve Agents, formed the band in 2004 with drummer and former Nerve Agents bandmate Andy Granelli, then also of The Distillers. They were joined shortly thereafter by bass guitarist Rob Barbato, who shared songwriting and vocals with Presley, and rhythm guitarist Jared "The Sandwich" Everett. Will Canzoneri joined the band on organ and clavinet in the latter half of 2006. The band released three LPs and one EP. Presley is also a visual artist responsible for much of the band's imagery. The band's name was derived from a T.S.O.L. song of the same name. History Originally signed to Tarantulas Records, Darker My Love released its first EP in 2004. Their first LP, recorded in 2005, was released on August 22, 2006, on Dangerbird Records. In spring 2006, Presley and Barbato became members of the prolific British post-punk group The Fall, and both are prominent on The Fall's 2007 album Reformation Post TLC. On August 28, 2007, the band released a 12-inch 45 rpm split record with Denver-based rock group Moccasin, contributing the song "Hair Decisions."
