Holy Cross High School (San Antonio, Texas)
Holy Cross of San Antonio is a Catholic, coeducational college preparatory secondary school located in the Loma Vista neighborhood of San Antonio, Texas, on the west side of the city, in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Antonio. History Holy Cross was opened in 1957 by the Archdiocese of San Antonio. At the suggestion of the Brothers of Holy Cross it was established as a four-year college preparatory school for boys. The first class of 84 boys enrolled as freshmen on September 3, 1957, with a faculty of three Brothers and a chaplain. It was jointly funded by a tuition fee and a subsidy from the Archdiocese. In 1968 the school faced possible closure because of the threatened withdrawal of the Archdiocese subsidy, but the financial issues were resolved, in part by adding grades 7 and 8 so that it became a middle and secondary school. Due to a lack of medical services in the area, in 1981 parents and alumni supported the establishment of Holy Cross Family Medical Center, which was expanded in 1985 and moved to a site across the street from the school, where it remains in operation.In 1994 the school was incorporated as an independent Catholic
