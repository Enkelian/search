Everything in Time
Everything in Time (B-sides, Rarities, Remixes) is a compilation album comprising B-sides, remixes, and rare songs by the American third wave ska band No Doubt, first released on November 23, 2003 as disc three of No Doubt's box set, Boom Box, which also contained The Singles 1992–2003, The Videos 1992–2003 and Live in the Tragic Kingdom. Everything in Time was later released separately on October 12, 2004. The album's B-sides and rarities originate in recording sessions for the band's fourth studio album, Return of Saturn. The first six tracks were used as B-sides for three of the singles released off the album, "Ex-Girlfriend", "Simple Kind of Life" and "Bathwater". Everything in Time also includes a remix of the song "New", also from Return of Saturn, and two remixes of "Rock Steady", the title track from No Doubt's fifth studio album, Rock Steady. The album received little coverage, not being a studio album, although the publications that did cover it gave average or good reviews, both in the box set Boom Box and it is in solo release. It charted on the U.S. Billboard 200 album chart at number 182. Background No Doubt's fourth studio album, Return of Saturn was recorded
