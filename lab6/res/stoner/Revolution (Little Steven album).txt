Revolution (Little Steven album)
Revolution is the fourth solo album by Little Steven released in 1989. The Disciples of Soul were gone in all but name (although former Disciple/Young Rascals drummer Dino Danelli did the album art), and the music was largely electronic. In 2019, the album was remastered for release as part of Van Zandt's career-spanning box set Rock N Roll Rebel: The Early Work. The digital deluxe edition of the album was released on November 15, 2019 containing two bonus tracks.
