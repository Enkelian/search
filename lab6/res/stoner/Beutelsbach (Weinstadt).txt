Beutelsbach (Weinstadt)
Beutelsbach is a town district or Stadtteil within the town of Weinstadt ("Wine City") in Rems-Murr district, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. The Stadtteil has a population of 8,464 (as of March 31, 2010) and an elevation of 236 m above sea level. History Beutelsbach was first mentioned in 1080 and was one of the oldest properties of the House of Württemberg. The first known ancestor of the Württemberg family was Konrad von Württemberg, whose nephew Konrad (son of Luitgard von Beutelsbach) further established the family. The Beutelsbach Stift (or college) was probably founded in the 11th century and then later expanded by Count Ulrich I. of Württemberg. The collegiate church in Beutelsbach was the burial site of the House of Württemberg from that point until the Stift was destroyed in 1311 and moved to Stuttgart. The Poor Conrad peasant rebellion began in Beutelsbach in May 1514. Since 1989, an exhibit on peasant revolts in the former town hall has memorialized the peasant uprisings in 1514 and 1525. In 1968, the remains of Burg Beutelsbach (Beutelsbach Castle) were discovered on Kappelberg, a hill above the town. From 1958 through 1976, Stanford University in California, United States, maintained an "overseas campus" for Stanford undergraduates
