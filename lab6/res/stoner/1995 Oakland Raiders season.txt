1995 Oakland Raiders season
The 1995 Oakland Raiders season was the franchise's 26th season in the National Football League, the 36th overall, and their 1st back in Oakland since 1981. The Raiders announced their return to Oakland on June 25, 1995, and the Alameda County Board of Supervisors approved it the next month. While the Raiders raced out to an impressive 8â€“2 start, a number of key injuries (including the loss of starting quarterback Jeff Hostetler) caused them to lose their final six games and miss the playoffs.
