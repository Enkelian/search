Portland Mercury
Portland Mercury is an alternative bi-weekly newspaper and media company founded in 2000 in Portland, Oregon. It had been published weekly until September 2018 before switching to bi-weekly. It serves to chronicle the Portland music scene, and generally includes interviews, commentaries, reviews, and concert dates. It has an "I, Anonymous" section, in which local readers are encouraged to submit anonymous, usually impassioned, and often incendiary letters to the city at large, and Dan Savage's syndicated advice column Savage Love. There are adult, abstract and surrealist comic strips such as Maakies by Tony Millionaire, Kaz's Underworld by Kaz, and Idiot Box by Matt Bors. The Mercury is similar in style to its sibling publication, Seattle, Washington's The Stranger. Contributors and staff Editor-in-Chief: Wm.
