Hemorphin
Hemorphins are a class of naturally occurring, endogenous opioid peptides which are found in the bloodstream, and are derived from the Î²-chain of hemoglobin. They have antinociceptive effects via activation of the opioid receptors, and some may also play a role in blood pressure through inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), as well as cause an elevation of endogenous enkephalin levels. Some examples of hemorphins include hemorphin-4, spinorphin, and valorphin. See also Casomorphin == References ==
