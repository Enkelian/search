The aim was to create an airline service between Nouméa, the mainland and the islands. From Dragon "Rapide" to Héron The company's first aircraft landed on 9 August 1955 at La Tontouta. The twin-engine, fabric-covered aircraft was a De Havilland Dragon "Rapide" DH 89 and could carry 8 passengers. The Dragon "Rapide's" inaugural flight took place on 28 September 1955 to Maré and Lifou from Magenta. The service to the Isle of Pines and Ouvéa began in October 1955. After one year in business, Transpac had transported 5,057 passengers with only one aircraft! In February 1958, Transpac purchased the De Havilland Héron DH 114; a 17-seater aircraft. The aim was to meet the needs of increasing local traffic.
