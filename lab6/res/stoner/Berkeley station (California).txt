Berkeley station (California)
Berkeley is an Amtrak station in Berkeley, California, served by Amtrak California's Capitol Corridor service. The station is located under the University Avenue overpass just west of 4th Street. It is served directly by AC Transit bus routes 51B and 802; additionally, AC Transit Transbay routes FS, G, and Z stop nearby at 6th Street. History The depot was built by the Southern Pacific in 1913, although it has since been turned into a restaurant.Amtrak California service at Berkeley began in 1986 with the twice-daily San Joaquins, which then operated between Oakland and Bakersfield. Berkeley was an original stop on the Capitol Corridor (originally named Capitols) when that service began in late 1991. San Joaquins service at Berkeley ended in 1993 because of low ridership. The San Joaquins still pass through the station without stopping. The current platform opened on September 17, 2005, after a $2.4 million renovation. Additional renovation work included installation of nighttime lighting, benches and landscaping; improved access for people with disabilities; and street repaving and new striping for more efficient access by buses, bicycles, paratransit, shuttles and taxis.
