Pitbull's Globalization Radio
Pitbull's Globalization Radio is a Sirius XM Radio station playing current-based Rhythmic/Dance hits from around the globe. The channel, which is co-owned by American musician/rapper/songwriter/entertainer Pitbull and named after his 2014 album "Globalization," was launched May 19, 2015. Details The channel's concept was inspired by Pitbull's musical influences and his love for Rhythmic, R&B/Hip-Hop, Dance/EDM, and Dance/Pop hits from international acts. The combination of these elements, along with Pitbull's musical catalog, mix shows, and live sets, make up the core basis of the format. The playlist and presentation serves as a bridge between the Rhythmic Pop focused Venus and the Dance-intensive BPM. The channel is a Rhythmic reporter in Mediabase, which added the station to its panel in October 2015. In order to make room for the channel, Sirius XM moved the 40s On 4 to channel 73, re-launching as 40s Junction.To help celebrate the launch, the artist kicked off the debut with a live show at New York City's Apollo Theater on May 19, 2015.
