Earthrise (album)
Earthrise is a concept album originally released in 1986, written by former Electric Light Orchestra (ELO) member Richard Tandy and David Morgan, both from Birmingham, UK. Morgan also wrote songs for 1960s band The Move. The album's story is about a space explorer who longs to return to his one love on Earth, only to eventually find that true love has always been with him — inside. The album's synthesizer-heavy rock sound is similar to ELO's 1981 album Time (1981). Although the album was well received by ELO fans, it was not a commercial success, largely due to the absence of marketing. Rock Legacy released a remastered version on CD in 2011.
