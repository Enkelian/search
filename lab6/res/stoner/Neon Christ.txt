Neon Christ
Neon Christ was an American hardcore punk band from Atlanta, Georgia. History The band was formed in 1983 by Randy DuTeau (vocals), William DuVall (guitar), Danny Lankford (bass guitar), and Jimmy Demer (drums). For a brief spell in 1985, they added a second guitarist named Shawn Devine. The band recorded and released two EPs, Parental Suppression and The Knife That Cuts So Deep, but only the former was a stand-alone; the latter was the second disc of a double 7" release that came out in 1990, four years after the band broke up. The song "Ashes to Ashes" was included as the third track on the International P.E.A.C.E. Benefit Compilation, a 1984 double album, released on R Radical Records, featuring 55 hardcore punk acts from around the world. They toured throughout the Atlanta area, playing alongside other notable acts such as Corrosion of Conformity and Dead Kennedys. The band played one final show in February 1986 before going their separate ways for the next two decades. Neon Christ reunited for a one-time show on February 2, 2008 in Lawrenceville, Georgia. The reception that they got inspired them to work with director Edgar Johnson on creating a documentary film called All
