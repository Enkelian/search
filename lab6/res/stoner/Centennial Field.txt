Centennial Field
Centennial Field is the name of the baseball stadium at the University of Vermont in Burlington, Vermont and is the home of the Vermont Lake Monsters of the New York Penn League (minor league), the Short Season Class A affiliate of the Oakland Athletics. Beyond the left-field fence is the former home of the University of Vermont's men's and women's soccer teams as well as once serving as UVM's home field for its men's and women's lacrosse teams, and its football team (1900–1974). The field takes its name, Centennial Field, from the fact that the land on which it was built was dedicated to its current purpose on July 6, 1904, at the conclusion of the three-day celebration of the 100th anniversary of UVM's first graduating class. Its first baseball game was on April 17, 1906 with UVM's 10–4 victory over the University of Maine. Larry Gardner was the first batter for UVM. Future-Boston Red Sox pitcher Ray Collins started the game for Vermont and threw the first pitch at the ballpark. Gardner and Collins are among 11 former Catamounts to reach the major leagues, the latest being Matt Duffy, who played on the most recent UVM teams in 2008
