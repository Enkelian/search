Interstate 410
Interstate 410 (abbreviated I-410, and colloquially called Loop 410) is a loop route of Interstate 10 around San Antonio, Texas. It is identified as Connally Loop in honor of former Texas governor John Connally. Route description Interstate 410 circumnavigates the city of San Antonio, officially beginning and ending at the junction with Interstate 35 on the southwest side of the loop. There are vast differences between the northern arc and southern arc of the loop. The northern arc serves the heavily urbanized portions of San Antonio and is currently being upgraded to as many as five lanes in each direction. The southern arc resembles more of a rural interstate as it transverses for the most part undeveloped portions of San Antonio as a two lane interstate. I-410 intersects I-10 twice, I-35 twice, I-37 once, as well as U.S. Highway 90, US 281, and State Highway 151, all freeways in the San Antonio metro area with the exception of Loop 1604, which forms a secondary loop around the city, and PA 1502 (Wurzbach Parkway), which is located about 2 miles outside the loop on the north side. I-410 serves San Antonio International Airport, Lackland AFB, Fort Sam Houston, South Texas Medical
