History Formation and early years As high school students Spencer Seim and Zach Hill were both members of the Northern California band Legs on Earth along with Josh Hill on guitar and Julian Imsdahl on bass and vocals. The band achieved some moderate local success, becoming renowned for their wild live shows, young age, and Primus-esque sound. The band sounded similar to Primus, especially the vocals and bass but Zach Hill described it in an interview as pop music but like Devo and Talking Heads. They released one CD in 2001 called Lasers & Saviors on local record label Para-Sight Records, now out of print. In
