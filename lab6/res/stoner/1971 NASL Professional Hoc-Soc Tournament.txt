It was held in St. Louis, Missouri on the evening of March 19, 1971 and involved four of the league's eight franchises. Overview Indoor soccer tournaments had been played in one form or another in North America throughout much of the 20th Century, but 1971 marked the first time that a Division One professional league organized an indoor competition for its member clubs. The total purse was $2,800. The winning side received $1,000, while the runners-up earned $750. The winners and losers of the third place match made $600 and $450 respectively.The matches themselves were all played on March 19 at the St. Louis Arena. Individual matches lasted 30 minutes and were divided by an intermission into two 15-minute periods. Golden goal overtime was in place to break any tie after regulation time if needed. The first two matches were scheduled for 8:00 PM and 8:45 PM starts, with the others to follow at unspecified times. Four of the NASL's five established franchises participated: the Dallas Tornado, Rochester Lancers, St. Louis Stars and Washington Darts. The Atlanta Chiefs did not.
