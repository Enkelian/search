Balonne Beacon
The Balonne Beacon is a newspaper published in St George, Shire of Balonne, Queensland, Australia from 1878 onwards. It was originally called the St. George Standard and Balonne Advertiser. History The first issue of the St. George Standard and Balonne Advertiser appeared on 10 July 1878. A fire destroyed the office and printery on 2 September 1905 and it was replaced by the Balonne Beacon, whose first issue was published on 4 October 1905. The Balonne Beacon also absorbed the Maranoa News on 7 July 1955. William Norman Dendle and Eva Dendle ran the paper from 1936 to 1971; and it was purchased in October 1971 by Max and Rada Pringle, who ran it for twenty-two years until the end of 1993. It was then sold to Rob and Pam Elkington and finally purchased by APN News & Media, the current proprietors, in mid-1997. Digitisation The paper has been digitised as part of the Australian Newspapers Digitisation Program of the National Library of Australia.
