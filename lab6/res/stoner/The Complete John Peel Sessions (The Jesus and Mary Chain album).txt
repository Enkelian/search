The Complete John Peel Sessions (The Jesus and Mary Chain album)
The Complete John Peel Sessions is an album released by Scottish alternative band The Jesus and Mary Chain. It comprises the sessions the group recorded for the late Radio 1 DJ John Peel on his late night radio show from 23 October 1984 to 26 November 1989. Peel was an early supporter of the band and gave them well needed publicity which they were unable to gain from the majority of other DJs and music programs of the day who concentrated mostly on the Synthpop craze sweeping the 1980s. In 1985 (the year of the band's debut release Psychocandy), John Peel show listeners voted them 1st (Never Understand), 2nd (Just Like Honey) and 12th (You Trip Me Up) in his annual Festive Fifty chart.[1] Track listing All songs written by Jim Reid and William Reid, except where noted.
