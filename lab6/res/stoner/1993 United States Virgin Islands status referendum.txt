1993 United States Virgin Islands status referendum
A status referendum was held in the United States Virgin Islands on 11 October 1993. After the United States Congress modified the Revised Organic Act of the Virgin Islands to allow a vote on the status of the islands, a vote was scheduled for 1989. It was delayed several times until 1993, when voters were offered the options of integration into the United States, becoming a United States territory or independence.Although 82% voted in favour of territorial status, voter turnout was below the 50% threshold and the result was invalidated.
