ARPANET
The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) was the first wide-area packet-switching network with distributed control and the first network to implement the TCP/IP protocol suite. Both technologies became the technical foundation of the Internet. The ARPANET was established by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the United States Department of Defense.Building on the ideas of J. C. R. Licklider, Bob Taylor initiated the ARPANET project in 1966 and appointed Larry Roberts as program manager. Roberts made the key decisions about the network design. He incorporated Donald Daviesâ€™ concepts and designs for packet switching, and sought input from Paul Baran. ARPA awarded the contract to build the network to Bolt Beranek & Newman who developed the first protocol for the network. Roberts engaged Leonard Kleinrock to develop mathematical methods for analyzing the packet network technology.The first computers were connected in 1969 and the Network Control Program was implemented in 1970. The network expanded rapidly and was declared operational in 1975 when control passed to the Defense Communications Agency. Internetworking research in the early 1970s by Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf led to the formulation of the Transmission Control Program (TCP) in 1974, which incorporated concepts from the French CYCLADES
