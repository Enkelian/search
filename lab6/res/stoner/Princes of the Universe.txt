Princes of the Universe
"Princes of the Universe" is a song written by Freddie Mercury and performed by the British rock band Queen. The song was written for the soundtrack of the movie Highlander, and released on the album A Kind of Magic, which also featured other selections from the Highlander song score, in 1986.In terms of musical style, the song is notable for being one of the most hard-edged tracks performed by the band, featuring a bombastic sound reminiscent of contemporary hard rock and heavy metal and vocals by Mercury akin to opera. A music video for the song, which featured Mercury sword-fighting, achieved some notoriety. Background "Princes of the Universe," written and composed for Highlander, is the only song on the album for which Mercury receives sole credit. The song's name comes from the original working title of the film. It is played over the film's opening credits, and was later used as the opening theme for Highlander: The Series. The song was never released as a single in the United Kingdom, and while it never truly charted, it is considered a cult favourite because of its relation to the film. In the movie, the guitar solo in the beginning is deleted.
