Inferior orbital fissure
The lateral wall and the floor of the orbit are separated posteriorly by the inferior orbital fissure which transmits the zygomatic branch of the maxillary nerve and the ascending branches from the pterygopalatine ganglion. The infraorbital vessels are found in the inferior orbital fissure, and travel down the infraorbital groove into the infraorbital canal and exit through the infraorbital foramen. Inferior division of ophthalmic vein passes through the inferior orbital fissure. It is formed by the sphenoid bone and maxilla.
