Myrkskog is a death metal band formed in 1993 from Drammen, Norway. History Their music consists of high speed double-bass with rapid blastbeats and fills. Guitars are made up of harmonic tremolo picking and sometimes power chords with fast solos composed by Destructhor who, along with Secthdamon, were members in Zyklon. Their debut album Deathmachine is a hybrid of black metal and death metal. Their second album Superior Massacre is much more death metal-oriented with more prominent bass-lines and less tremolo picked riffs. The name 'Myrkskog' is a translation of the Norwegian word for 'Mirkwood'. Destructhor joined Morbid Angel in 2008 and departed in 2015. Since leaving Myrkskog, Savant M (going under the moniker Drakul Azacain) formed the black metal band Disiplin, who have released two albums, and was briefly a member of Dissection. The current line-up is guitarist/vocalist Destructhor, guitarist/backing vocalist Secthdamon, bassist Demariel (or Gortheon) and drummer Dominator. Secthdamon changed from drums to guitar in 2013.
