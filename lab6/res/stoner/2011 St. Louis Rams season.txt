2011 St. Louis Rams season
The 2011 St. Louis Rams season was the team's 74th season in the National Football League, the 17th overall in St. Louis and the third under head coach Steve Spagnuolo. The Rams failed to improve on their 7–9 record from 2010, and one day after the season finale, head coach Steve Spagnuolo and general manager Billy Devaney were fired from the team. The team secured the second overall pick in the 2012 NFL Draft. The Rams' offense was among the worst in the league in 2011. They scored only 193 points (12.1 points per game), last in the league, and 11th-fewest all-time for a 16-game season. Their −214 point differential was last in the league.Football Outsiders ranked St. Louis the worst team in the league, per play, in 2011. The 2012 Football Outsiders Almanac, however, noted that the Rams went from the league's easiest schedule in 2010 to the league's hardest schedule in 2011.With their 2–14 record, the Rams capped a stretch from 2007 to 2011 in which they went 15–65, which was at the time the worst five-season span in NFL history. This mark has since been matched by the Cleveland Browns of 2013 to 2017. Offseason Coaching changes
