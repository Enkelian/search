World Series by Renault
The Renault Sport Series (formerly known as World Series by Renault) is a motor racing series. The series currently consists of the Eurocup Formula Renault 2.0, and used to contain the Renault Sport Trophy and the Formula Renault 3.5 Series. The F4 Eurocup 1.6 was made part of the World Series in 2010, but was then folded for 2011. The flagship for the Renault Sport Series from its beginning to 2015 was the Formula Renault 3.5 Series (often referred to as simply World Series by Renault or simply WSR). It became the Formula V8 3.5 in 2016, when Renault Sport retired its backing. History Renault started the Formula Renault V6 Eurocup in 2003, as a support series in Eurosport's Super Racing Weekends (ETCC and FIA GT Championship). The series ran with Tatuus chassis and a Nissan 3.5 L V6 engine. In 2005, Renault left the Super Racing Weekend and started the World Series by Renault and the Formula Renault 3.5 Series, merging both the World Series by Nissan (whose engine contract had finished) and Renault V6 Eurocup. The Dallara chassis was retained, while the Renault V6 was improved to 425 PS. Formula Renault 2.0 Eurocup and the Eurocup MÃ©gane Trophy
