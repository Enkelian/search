Upper March
The Upper March (in Arabic: الثغر الأعلى‎, aṯ-Tagr al-A'la; in Spanish: Marca Superior) was an administrative and military division in northeast Al-Andalus, roughly corresponding to the Ebro valley and adjacent Mediterranean coast, from the 8th century to the early 11th century. It was established as a frontier province, or march, of the Emirate, later Caliphate of Córdoba, facing the Christian lands of the Carolingian Empire's Marca Hispanica, the Asturo-Leonese marches of Castile and Alava, and the nascent autonomous Pyrenean principalities. In 1018, the decline of the central Cordoban state allowed the lords of the Upper March to establish in its place the Taifa of Zaragoza. Formation of the Upper March Following the Muslim conquest of the majority of the Iberian peninsula, the lands of what would become the Upper March were granted to Arab and Berber troops that had participated in the invasion, but unlike other regions, the Ebro valley saw a large number of native families being allowed to keep their lands in exchange for their conversion to Islam and oaths of fealty. When a Berber Revolt in the early 740s destabilized the frontier, the neighboring Christian Kingdom of Asturias moved into the depopulated lands bordering the Upper March
