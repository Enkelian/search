The Big Top 40 Show
The Official Big Top 40 is a radio chart show broadcast every Sunday afternoon from 4-7pm on Global's Capital and Heart networks presented by Will Manning. It is the most-listened to chart show in the UK with a weekly audience of 2.2 million listeners, more than the Official Chart on BBC Radio 1. The show descends from The Network Chart Show, which started in September 1984. Prior to January 2019, the show was broadcast on 140 commercial radio stations in the UK. It was the only radio show aired by both Global and Bauer, the two largest commercial radio groups in the UK, as well as many smaller operators and independent stations. The chart is compiled based on downloads, streaming, and radio airplay from the stations that broadcast the show. It is the only UK chart to include radio airplay, much like Billboard in the USA. The algorithm differs to that of the Official Chart, which also includes physical sales but does not take radio airplay into account.
