The Best of Fear Factory
The Best of Fear Factory is a best-of compilation album released on Roadrunner Records, featuring a collection of Fear Factory's music with the label (as such, Archetype and Transgression material are not included). The record was released without Fear Factory's involvement (they were signed to Liquid 8 Records at the time of the album's release), so it's unlikely that the album is officially recognized by the band themselves. Songs from Concrete, as well as their various compilation, live, and remix albums, are not included. The album was released on September 12, simultaneously with similarly unsanctioned best-of collections of the bands Sepultura, Type O Negative, and Ill Niño. Track listing Personnel Burton C.
