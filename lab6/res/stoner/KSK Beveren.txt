KSK Beveren
Koninklijke Sportkring Beveren (Royal Sporting Club of Beveren) is a Belgian association football club from the town of Beveren in East Flanders. KSK Beveren was particularly successful during the late 1970s and early 1980s in which it won two national championships and two Belgian Cups. In 1979 the club became the first champion of Belgium from the East Flanders province. KSK Beveren is up to the present day the only Belgian champion that is based in a municipality instead of a city. The club came into financial decline in the late 1990s and almost went bankrupt in 2010. The club's male first team ceased all footballing activities in May 2010 to (unofficially) merge with KV Red Star Waasland, becoming KV Red Star Waasland-Beveren. A small fraction of fans started a new club in Belgium's lowest division, called YB SK Beveren. Both teams claim to be the rightful heir of KSK Beveren. However, the original KSK Beveren is still in existence and has a ladies team, which as of 2018 will play in the highest provincial league in women's football.
