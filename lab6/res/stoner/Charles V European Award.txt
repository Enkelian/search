Charles was crowned emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, in the Aachen palatine chapel, the same place where previously Charlemagne had been crowned. Charles, of Spanish and German ancestors, in the sixteenth century ruled Spain, the Netherlands, Germany and other nations of Central Europe. This emperor, although born in Ghent, he developed a deep appreciation for Spain and its habits, as well as for the Spanish language. He spent his last days suffering gout in the Monastery of Yuste, in Estremadura, where he had meetings with his son John of Austria.
