Djangology
Djangology is a compilation album by Django Reinhardt and Stephane Grappelli, released in 1961. In 1949, Reinhardt and Grappelli reunited for a brief tour of Italy. While they were there, they recorded about 50 tunes with an Italian rhythm section, and although they didn't know it at the time, these sessions would mark the last time the Gypsy guitarist and the French violinist recorded together. This CD collects 23 of the best tracks from those final sessions, including versions of Hot Club standards like "Minor Swing", "Bricktop", and "Swing '42". Reinhardt died not long after he returned from Italy, so he and Grappelli were never able to continue their musical exploration.
