Field hockey at the 1908 Summer Olympics
At the 1908 Summer Olympics, a field hockey tournament was contested for the first time. Six teams entered the tournament: England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Germany and France. England won the gold medal, Ireland the silver and Scotland and Wales were awarded bronze medals. All the medals were subsequently credited to Great Britain. Squads Great Britain Results Bracket First round Semi-finals There were no playoffs for third place, so the losers of the semi-finals received bronze medals. Extra match A match between the two continental teams took place between the semifinals and the final. Both France and Germany had lost in the first round, and thus the extra match could be considered to be a fifth and sixth place playoff match, though the official report makes no mention of that. Final The official report ceases its description of the game after England took the lead 5â€“1, saying only that "by this time England had taken control of the game and won with eight goals to one".
