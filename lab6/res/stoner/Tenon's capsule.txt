Tenon's capsule
The Tenon capsule (), also known as the fascial sheath of the eyeball (Latin: vagina bulbi) or the fascia bulbi, is a thin membrane which envelops the eyeball from the optic nerve to the corneal limbus, separating it from the orbital fat and forming a socket in which it moves. The inner surface of the Tenon capsule is smooth and is separated from the outer surface of the sclera by the periscleral lymph space. This lymph space is continuous with the subdural and subarachnoid cavities and is traversed by delicate bands of connective tissue which extend between the capsule and the sclera. The capsule is perforated behind by the ciliary vessels and nerves and fuses with the sheath of the optic nerve and with the sclera around the entrance of the optic nerve. In front it adheres to the conjunctiva, and both structures are attached to the ciliary region of the eyeball. The structure was named after Jacques-René Tenon (1724–1816), a French surgeon and pathologist. Structure Relations The Tenon capsule is perforated by the tendons of the ocular muscles and is reflected backward on each as a tubular sheath. The sheath of the obliquus superior is carried as far as
