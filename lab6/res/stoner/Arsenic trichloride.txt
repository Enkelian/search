Arsenic trichloride
Arsenic trichloride is an inorganic compound with the formula AsCl3, also known as arsenous chloride or butter of arsenic. This poisonous oil is colourless, although impure samples may appear yellow. It is an intermediate in the manufacture of organoarsenic compounds. Structure AsCl3 is a pyramidal molecule with C3v symmetry. The As-Cl bond is 2.161 Å and the angle Cl-As-Cl is 98° 25'±30. AsCl3 has four normal modes of vibration: ν1(A1) 416, ν2(A1) 192, ν3 393, and ν4(E) 152 cm−1. Arsenic trichloride contains predominantly covalent bonds, which explains its low melting point. Synthesis This colourless liquid is prepared by treatment of arsenic(III) oxide with hydrogen chloride followed by distillation: As2O3 + 6 HCl → 2 AsCl3 + 3 H2OIt can also be prepared by chlorination of arsenic at 80–85 °C, but this method requires elemental arsenic. 2 As + 3 Cl2 → 2 AsCl3Arsenic trichloride can also be prepared by the reaction of arsenic oxide and sulfur monochloride. This method requires simple apparatus and proceeds efficiently: 2 As2O3 + 6 S2Cl2 → 4 AsCl3 + 3 SO2 + 9 SA convenient laboratory method is refluxing arsenic(III) oxide with thionyl chloride: 2 As2O3 + 3 SOCl2 → 2 AsCl3 + 3 SO2
