Sunday Sport
Sunday Sport is a British tabloid newspaper, published by Sport Newspapers, which was originally established in 1986. Defenders of the publication have said the Sport was never intended to be taken seriously: it has featured such stories as a London Bus being discovered at the Antarctic, a World War II Bomber on the Moon, or a statue of Elvis Presley on Mars. Its content also includes a high quotient of softcore female nudity and advertising for sexual services. History The Sunday Sport was founded in 1986, the first issue for sale was dated 14 September 1986. Its original publisher was David Sullivan. Advertising in the Sunday Sport was once the responsibility of Sullivan's protegee Karren Brady (now the life peer Baroness Brady), who later became managing director of Birmingham City Football Club and vice chairman of West Ham United. Sullivan sold the paper to Sport Newspapers, but had to give them a Â£1.68m bailout in 2009. The last editor was Nick Appleyard, appointed in September 2007. His predecessors included Dominic Mohan, Michael Gabbert and Paul Carter. Its sister daily title, Daily Sport, began publication in 1991, but ceased publication and entered administration on 1 April 2011. One of the creditors
