Sverigetopplistan
Sverigetopplistan (Swedish: [ˈsvæ̂rjɛˌtɔpːlɪstan], lit. "Sweden top list") is the Swedish national record chart, earlier known as Topplistan (1975–1997) and Hitlistan (1998–2007) and known by its current name since October 2007, based on sales data from the Swedish Recording Industry Association (in Swedish Grammofonleverantörernas förening). Before Topplistan, music sales in Sweden were recorded by Kvällstoppen, whose weekly chart was a combined albums and singles list. History For the period of 1976 to 2006, the official Swedish music charts were published by Sveriges Radio P3, a station owned by Sveriges Radio. At the end of 2006, it stopped publishing the general charts, which were entrusted to Swedish Recording Industry Association in the beginning of 2007. However, Sveriges Radio P3 continued to publish the most downloaded music charts, according to the statistics compiled by Nielsen SoundScan. The new strictly-download chart was called DigiListan.Since late 2006, the chart has included legal downloads. On 29 October 2010 the chart became the first in the world to include music streaming.From 14 November 1975 to 8 September 1993 the chart was only published every 2 weeks.
