École supérieure de chimie physique électronique de Lyon
École Supérieure de Chimie Physique Électronique de Lyon or CPE Lyon is a French engineering school, located in Villeurbanne, near Lyon. Degrees CPE Lyon offers two diplôme d'ingénieur (French: [diplom dɛ̃ʒenjœʁ]) and two Master's level degrees, in two disciplines and three diplomas.The chemistry and chemical engineering degrees involve the conception, synthesis and manufacture of new and valuable molecules that can be “first on the market". They also involve a focus on environmental issues, sustainability and management. The electronics, telecommunications, maths and computer science degrees include a global education in electronics, microelectronics, computer science, image and signal processing, telecommunications, applied math and management. CPE Lyon also conducts research in organic chemistry, analytical sciences, chemical and process engineering, microelectronics and image processing. Selected students can prepare a Ph.D. in one of the research laboratories (50 new students per year on average). History In 1883, the École Supérieure de Chimie Industrielle de Lyon (ESCIL) was founded by Jules Raulin, a student of Louis Pasteur. In 1919 1912 Nobel Prize in Chemistry winner Victor Grignard became a director. In that same year, the Institut de Chimie et Physique Industrielles de Lyon (ICPI) was founded by Professor Lepercq. In 1933, the École Supérieure de Chimie
