Musicube
A Musicube is a list of preferred musical genres that allows users to express their musical tastes online. Created in 2006 for BBC Radio 1, each genre is mapped to an outline of Radio 1 shows that play the selected style of music. In turn, each show links to BBC's online radio player which replays each show online for one week after its live airing. Once created, users can put a Musicube tower wherever they have a webspace (e.g. MySpace, Blogger.com, website, etc.). Users without a webspace can send a link to friends to show their musical preferences. Hidden within the Musicube tower is a 'Sound Toy'. The smaller cubes, each which represents a Radio 1 show, behave like an audio mixer when the user drags them around. This is not to be confused with the Music Cube game, launched in January 2008 by Taptu and Inbox Digital. External links Official website
