Babylonian astronomy was the study or recording of celestial objects during early history Mesopotamia. These records can be found on Sumerian clay tablets, inscribed in cuneiform, dated to around 1000 BCE.In conjunction with their mythology, the Sumerians developed a form of astronomy/astrology that had an influence on Babylonian culture.
