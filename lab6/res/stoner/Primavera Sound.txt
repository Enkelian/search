Primavera Sound
Primavera Sound is a music festival that takes place between the end of May and beginning of June in Barcelona, Spain and Porto, Portugal. The first edition took place in 2001 in Poble Espanyol and in 2005 it moved to the Parc del FÃ²rum, a much larger site on the seafront. The nature of the festival (urban and an integrated part of the city) and the wide range of bands represented have made Primavera Sound a meeting point for artists and spectators from all generations. The festival presents all genres including pop, rock and the most underground tendencies of electronic and dance music.
