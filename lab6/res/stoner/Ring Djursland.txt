Ring Djursland
Ring Djursland is a motor racing circuit in Pederstrup, Denmark. The circuit is owned by Tradium, who run daily driving courses there. It used to host rounds of the Danish Touringcar Championship, and now hosts rounds of the da:Danish Thundersport Championship. Ring Djursland first opened in 1965, but was altered a year later to its current layout. In 1983 it was bought by the Danish state, who renovated the track to use it as an educational centre with advanced driving courses for lorry drivers. After losing its environmental permit in the late 1980s, it reopened for racing in 1994. A relatively short circuit at 1.75 kilometers, it is known for its tight and hilly circuit layout.
