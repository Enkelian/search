Screaming Bloody Murder (song)

This is Sum 41's first single to feature guitarist Tom Thacker. The song's working title was "Panic Attack" and it was written by Thacker for the album Muertos Vivos by his other band Gob, though it did not make the album, then reworked, rearranged and re-recorded by guitarist Deryck Whibley. Although written by Thacker, all guitars on the song, as well as on the rest of the album were recorded by Deryck Whibley by himself. Background On January 8, 2011, it was announced that the band will release the single "Screaming Bloody Murder" on February 8, 2011, in the United States, the band's first single in 3 years.
