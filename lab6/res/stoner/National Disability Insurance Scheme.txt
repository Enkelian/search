National Disability Insurance Scheme
The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) is a scheme of the Australian Government that funds costs associated with disability. The scheme was legislated for in 2013 and is expected to be in full operation nationally by 2020. It is administered by the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA).The scheme entitles people with a "permanent and significant" disability (under the age of 65), to full funding for any "reasonable and necessary" support needs related to their disability (subject to certain restrictions). Funding is allocated to the individual, and the individual or their guardian chooses which providers supply the funded goods and services (subject to certain restrictions). The scheme is entirely publicly funded: recipients do not purchase or contribute to an insurance policy, nor is funding means-tested. The term 'insurance' refers to the scheme's use of proactive insurance principles to manage long term financial sustainability, and that it aims to 'insure' any citizen will have costs covered in the event they are born with or acquire a disability. Individual NDIS funding is independent of the Disability Support Pension and universal health care. NDIS legislation draws a distinction between health care and disability supports, only the latter being within the remit of the NDIS.
