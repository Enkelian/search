Bow frog
The bow frog is the end part of a stringed musical instrument's bow that encloses the mechanism responsible for tightening and holding the bow hair ribbon. Most of the bow frogs used in today's classical bows are made of ebony; some synthetic bows have frogs made with materials that imitate ebony, while Baroque bows use frogs made with various woods. Etymology and names The origin of the name frog is unknown, although it may derive from the use of the frock, the small device that bow makers use to shape it. It is also referred to as the "heel" or "nut" of the bow. The German equivalent Frosch is the literal equivalent of "frog," while in French and Italian the equivalent of "heel" is used (talon and tallone). French also uses hausse. The foreign language terms sometimes appear in musical instructions, such as au talon, indicating to play with the bow near the frog. However, the English term is also used, such as in the Alfred edition of George Gershwin's An American in Paris, in which the violins and violas are instructed to play "near the frog" at bar 32.
