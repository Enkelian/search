2022 Commonwealth Shooting and Archery Championships
The 2022 Commonwealth Shooting and Archery Championships, commonly known as Chandigarh 2022, is an international multi-sport event for members of the Commonwealth that is scheduled to be held in Chandigarh, India. Events will be held in shooting sport and archery. The Championships are expected to take place in January 2022. The city was announced as the host by the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) in a press release on 24 February 2020. The Championships were conceived by the Indian Olympic Association (IOA), the International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF) and World Archery Federation (WA) following the exclusion of both sports from the programme of the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, England. Approved and recognised by the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF), the event will be separate from the main Games, but medals won in Chandigarh will be counted with medals won in Birmingham in an official medal table published a week after the completion of the Games. Background Exclusion of shooting In January 2018, CEO of the CGF David Grevemberg confirmed that Shooting, which is an optional sport according to the CGF constitution, would not feature at the 2022 Commonwealth Games as the organising committee of the Games decided to exclude the sport.
