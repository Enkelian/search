Gregory Rogove
Gregory Rogove is an American indie music drummer and songwriter. He is notable for partnering with indie artist Devendra Banhart to form the group Megapuss. He signed a record contract with Knitting Factory Records in 2011. Background Rogove grew up in Amish country in Lancaster, Pennsylvania of Jewish parents with some of his distant ancestors being Mennonites. When eighteen, he traveled to India on a year-long scholarship and studied the tabla. He described India as a "swirl of energy." He traveled to Singapore, Mali, and Mexico. He spent five weeks in China at the Peking Opera and commented that the sound of the gongs made it seem likely that one's head would split in two. The journeys influenced his musical sensibility and helped him achieve a "rich repertoire" with diverse influences from freak folk, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, classical music, punk rock and world music, according to one source. At Wesleyan University, he studied musical composition. Upon his graduation in 2002, he was the recipient of the Pokora Prize, awarded annually to the outstanding undergraduate student in music composition. In the music scene in New York City, he founded a band called Tarantula A.D. which later became the band Priestbird.
