Liga de Fútbol Profesional
The Liga Nacional de Fútbol Profesional (National Professional Football League), also known as the Liga de Fútbol Profesional (LFP) and more commonly La Liga, is a national sports association responsible for administering the two professional football leagues in Spain - the Primera and Segunda División. The organisation was founded in 1984. Competition The 42 member clubs of the LFP are grouped into two divisions: La Liga (20 clubs) and Segunda División (22 clubs). In any given season a club plays each of the others in the same division twice, once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents. This makes for a total of 38 games played each season in LaLiga and 42 in Segunda División. Clubs gain three points for a win, one for a draw, and none for a defeat. At the end of each season, the club with the most points in LaLiga Santander is crowned champion. If points are equal, the head-to-head records determine the winner. If still equal, the goal difference and then goals scored become the deciding factors. As for Segunda División, at the top end three clubs win promotion to LaLiga, with the bottom three LaLiga clubs taking their places.
