Roger Dean (guitar player)
Roger Dean (born David Roger Bryan Dean; 16 March 1943 â€“ 3 August 2008) was a British guitar player and teacher. First took piano lessons at age 7, then guitar at age 10. Then had musical training at Eric Guilder guitar school in London with teacher Ivor Mairants. His professional career ran over 40 years until he retired following a car crash in 2004. During the 1960s he played in a number of bands which left few traces in the history of popular music. The notable exception occurred when he joined briefly John Mayall's Bluesbreakers. Dean's guitar is heard on Mayall's first album and single. Leaving Mayall, he went to work with his former band the Nu Notes. In 1971, he played with a band called Spike Island and recorded an album with them, a mixture of folk, country and world music. Later, as a member of various other bands like The Bluejays, P. P. Arnold's backing band and The Bad Boys, he recorded on some hits, but gradually turned to more anonymous work as a session musician playing for TV shows, backing stars and other lucrative jobs, such as cruises on the QE2 as guitarist with The Joe Loss
