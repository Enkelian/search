Omniscience (album)
Omniscience is the fifth live album by the American experimental rock band Swans. It was recorded from shows on their 1992 world tour. It is out of print and has never been reissued. The front cover photograph is by Larry Lame with many Deryk Thomas paintings in the booklet. Critical reception Trouser Press called it "a nicely-presented live document". Allmusic critic Ned Raggett wrote: "Ending with a fine version of "God Bless America" and the new, slow-grinding "Omnipotent," Omniscience is yet another excellent addition to Swans' body of work."
