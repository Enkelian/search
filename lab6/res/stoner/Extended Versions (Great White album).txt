Extended Versions (Great White album)
Stage is a live album released by the American hard rock band Great White in 1995. It was put together by Alan Niven, Great White's former manager, as a contractual release for Zoo Entertainment. The first six tracks of the CD come from a 1994 House of Blues benefit concert (Stage One) and the other songs from a 1993 Anaheim show (Stage Two), several tracks of which were previously featured as a bonus on the studio album Sail Away. The initial Japanese pressing was a two-disc set, and featured one bonus track for each show. The songs of this album, with the exception of "Maybe Someday" and "Congo Square", were re-issued in 2004 by BMG Special Products, with the title Extended Versions. This album was reissued again on both CD and Vinyl on February 21, 2020 by Deadline Music.
