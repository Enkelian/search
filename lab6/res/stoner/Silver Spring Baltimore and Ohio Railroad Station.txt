Silver Spring Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Station
Silver Spring station is a historic building located at Silver Spring in Montgomery County, Maryland on the Metropolitan Subdivision. It was built in 1945 on the foundation of the original station, a Victorian-style brick structure built in 1878. It was designed in the Colonial Revival style and built from standardized plans developed for B&O stations in the mid-1940s. Amtrak's Blue Ridge served the station until it was discontinued in 1986.MARC Brunswick Line service at the station ended in 2000, and trains now stop at nearby Silver Spring station where transfer to the Washington Metro is available. The 1945 station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000 as the Silver Spring Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Station and restored in 2002.The original 1940s waiting room furniture remains in the station, as are the original recessed fluorescent lighting fixtures. The Eastbound Waiting Room, a small rectangular building of similar design, stood on the south side of the tracks until it was lost to redevelopment in 2008. Originally built along with the station in 1945, it was razed and rebuilt in 1976, to make way for tracks laid for the Washington Metro. An underground pedestrian tunnel connecting the two buildings
