Interplanetary dust
The interplanetary dust cloud, or zodiacal cloud, consists of cosmic dust (small particles floating in outer space) that pervades the space between planets within planetary systems such as the Solar System. This system of particles has been studied for many years in order to understand its nature, origin, and relationship to larger bodies. In our Solar System, the interplanetary dust particles have a role in scattering sunlight and in emitting thermal radiation, which is the most prominent feature of the night sky's radiation with wavelengths ranging 5–50 μm. The particle sizes of grains characterizing the infrared emission near Earth's orbit typically range 10–100 μm.The total mass of the interplanetary dust cloud is approximately the mass of an asteroid of radius 15 km (with density of about 2.5 g/cm3). Straddling the zodiac along the ecliptic, this dust cloud is visible as the zodiacal light in a moonless and naturally dark sky and is best seen toward the Sun's direction during astronomical twilight. The Pioneer spacecraft observations in the 1970s linked the Zodiacal light with the interplanetary dust cloud in Earth's solar system. Also, the VBSDC instrument on the New Horizons probe was designed to detect impacts of the dust from the
