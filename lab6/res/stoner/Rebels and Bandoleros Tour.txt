Rebels and Bandoleros Tour
The Rebels and Bandoleros Tour was a worldwide concert tour by American rock band ZZ Top. First joining forces in 1974, Lynyrd Skynyrd toured with the group for two-and-a-half weeks during its initial leg, and for the latter part of the second leg in the United States. In contrast to ZZ Top's elaborately staged events from previous tours, the Rebels and Bandoleros Tour stage design was simple, yet embellishing. The stage featured dozens of lights and a large projection screen displayed behind the stage, which showed visual effects, video clips, and text phrases. Whereas ZZ Top was known for their enthusiastic live show in the 1970s, the group's Rebels and Bandoleros performances were intentionally ironic and self-reflective. Like other ZZ Top tours, each of the Rebels and Bandoleros shows opened with the same three songs before other material was played. With three legs and 79 shows, the tour began in Wichita, Kansas on May 12, 2011 and ended in Charleston, West Virginia on October 30, 2011. Its initial two legs visited the US and Europe before returning for a final leg in North America. After its conclusion, three shows were booked for the Rock Legends Cruise in Fort Lauderdale, Florida,
