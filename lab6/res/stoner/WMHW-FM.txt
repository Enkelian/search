WMHW-FM
WMHW-FM, "The Mountain 91.5," is the student-operated college radio station for Central Michigan University, located in Mount Pleasant, Michigan. The call letters stand for "Wilbur Moore Hall Wireless", a reference to the station's studios being located in Wilbur Moore Hall on the CMU campus. The station is under the auspices of CMU's College of Communication and Fine Arts, and is operated by students from the School of Broadcast and Cinematic Arts. The station changed from Modern Rock Radio 91.5 to Moore Rock Radio 91.5 on October 1, 2012. The biggest change is the inclusion of more mainstream rock music to their song selection. WMHW is the flagship station for CMU Women's Basketball, and Mt. Pleasant High School Football. WMHW Sports also covers select CMU Softball and CMU Baseball games and CMU Volleyball home games. In 2006, the Federal Communications Commission granted WMHW a power increase, slated to increase the station's signal from 340 watts to 13,000 watts. In addition, a new 450-foot transmitter tower was constructed, replacing the old 118-foot tower. The upgrade took place on September 28, 2007 at 11 am when CMU President Michael Rao gave the order to flip the switch to go to 13,000 watts. WMHW
