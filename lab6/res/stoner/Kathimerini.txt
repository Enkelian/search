Kathimerini
I Kathimerini (Greek: Η Καθημερινή, pronounced [i kaθimeriˈni], meaning "The Daily") is a daily morning newspaper published in Athens. Its first edition was printed on September 15, 1919. It is published in the Greek language, as well as in an abridged English-language edition. The English edition is sold separately in the United States and as a supplement to the international edition of The New York Times (formerly the International Herald Tribune) in Greece and Cyprus, and is also available online. In November 2008 a Kathimerini Cypriot weekend edition began to circulate.Kathimerini is also affiliated with the weekly newspaper Athens Plus published by I Kathimerini S.A. and the International Herald Tribune. History Kathimerini was founded by Georgios Vlachos, a prominent antivenizelist, in 1919 and was later inherited by his daughter Helen Vlachos (Eléni Vláchou) and her husband, retired submarine commander Constantine Loundras. Considered a high-quality broadsheet, Kathimerini is traditionally perceived as one of the main conservative voices of Greek media. The newspaper was highly critical of Eleftherios Venizelos in the early 20th century, and also opposed Georgios Papandreou in the postwar years. It maintains a traditional layout, with its original griffin logo, and incorporates illustrated glossy inserts in its Sunday edition.
