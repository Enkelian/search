Subramanian or Munirpallam Subramanian, is a solid-state chemist at Oregon State University in Corvallis, Oregon, and currently holds both the titles of Distinguished Professor and Milton Harris Chair of Materials Science in the Department of Chemistry. His work in solid-state chemistry on structure-property relationships of inorganic compounds has led to the discovery of novel functional materials, many of which have found usage in modern devices. Subramanian has authored 340 research publications and holds 57 patents. His publications have received >26,000 citations (h-index: 70). Early life and education Subramanian was born and raised in Chennai. Subramanian received his B.S. in Chemistry from the University of Madras, in 1975 and received a M.S in Inorganic Chemistry from the same university in 1977. Subramanian's master's thesis featured analysis of various minerals and alloy compounds. In 1982 Mas completed his Ph.D in Solid State Chemistry on pyrochlore oxides at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, India, under the guidance of the late Professor G. V. Subba Rao. The introduction to his thesis is a pyrochlore review that remains his most cited work to date. From 1982-1984 he was a Post
