Turbine generator
In electricity generation, a generator is a device that converts motive power (mechanical energy) into electrical power for use in an external circuit. Sources of mechanical energy include steam turbines, gas turbines, water turbines, internal combustion engines, wind turbines and even hand cranks. The first electromagnetic generator, the Faraday disk, was invented in 1831 by British scientist Michael Faraday. Generators provide nearly all of the power for electric power grids. The reverse conversion of electrical energy into mechanical energy is done by an electric motor, and motors and generators have many similarities. Many motors can be mechanically driven to generate electricity and frequently make acceptable manual generators. Terminology Electromagnetic generators fall into one of two broad categories, dynamos and alternators. Dynamos generate pulsing direct current through the use of a commutator. Alternators generate alternating current.Mechanically a generator consists of a rotating part and a stationary part: Rotor The rotating part of an electrical machine. Stator The stationary part of an electrical machine, which surrounds the rotor.One of these parts generates a magnetic field, the other has a wire winding in which the changing field induces an electric current: Field winding or field (permanent) magnets The magnetic field producing component of
