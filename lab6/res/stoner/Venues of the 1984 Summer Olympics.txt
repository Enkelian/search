Venues of the 1984 Summer Olympics
For the 1984 Summer Olympics, a total of thirty-one venues were used. Two venues from the 1932 Summer Olympics, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and the Rose Bowl, were used for these Games. Between the 1932 and the 1984 Summer Olympics, the expansion of professional sports teams assisted in the growth of the facilities that would be used for the 1984 events. Only two new permanent venues were constructed, both using corporate sponsorship though neither were mentioned in the official Olympic report. Many of the other venues had temporary adjustments and returned to their normal usage once the 1984 Olympics were completed. Stanford Stadium in Palo Alto and the Rose Bowl later served as venues for the Super Bowl, the FIFA World Cup, and the FIFA Women's World Cup. The velodrome that was constructed for the 1984 Games was demolished in 2003.
