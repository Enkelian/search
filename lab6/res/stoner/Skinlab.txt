Skinlab
Skinlab is a metal band formed in 1994 in San Francisco, California by vocalist/bassist Steev Esquivel (who used to sing in the Bay Area thrash metal band Defiance) and guitarist Mike Roberts, now with San Francisco Bay Areas RAZE the STRAY, guitarist Gary Wendt (who played for the Bay Area thrash band Sacrilege B.C. and currently fronts alt/metal band The Ghost Next Door), and drummer Paul Hopkins (the lineup having since been altered). After releasing 3 full-length studio albums and an EP, they disbanded in 2003 following the departure of two core members. Following the band's demise, vocalist/bassist Steev Esquivel and guitarist Steve "Snake" Green went on to form Re:Ignition. The band's debut album, Empty Heart, Loaded Gun, was released in November 2006 through Corporate Punishment Records. After a three-year hiatus, the band featuring line-up of Steev Esquivel, Snake, Glen Telford and Paul Hopkins had reformed and were rehearsing with plans for a new album in 2009. Following the 2009 release of Skinlab's album, The Scars Between Us, which according to Esquivel, performed badly sales-wise, guitarist Glenny Telford once again left the band. He was replaced by Brian Jackson (formerly of the Las Vegas band Kreep). As of June 2011
