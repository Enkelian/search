2008 Armenian Cup
The 2008 Armenian Cup was the 17th edition of the Armenian Cup, a football competition. In 2008, the tournament had 14 participants, out of which 6 were reserve teams. Summary Banants and Ararat got a pass on the 1st round because these two clubs reached the final the previous year. The first round passed without any surprises, as the reserve teams were expected to be knocked out. The quarter finals, however, turned out to be very interesting. Two of the matches had to be decided on penalties. Gandzasar put up quite a fight against defending Armenian Premier League champions Pyunik, and even managed to outplay the champions in various aspects of the game. Shirak also demonstrated a fighting spirit and managed to defeat defending cup holders Banants away, after losing the first leg at home. Luck turned Banants' way as the match was won only on penalties. The semifinals also turned out to be interesting as Banants and Ararat defeated Mika and Pyunik respectively with an aggregate score of 5-1. The final was a repeat of last year's final and this time it was Ararat that edged out on top as Marcos Pizzeli managed to sneak a late extra-time winner
