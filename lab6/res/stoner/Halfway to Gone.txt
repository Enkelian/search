Halfway to Gone
Halfway to Gone is an American heavy metal band from New Jersey. The band formed in 1999 when bassist and founding member of Solarized, Lou Gorra got together with Lee Stuart (Solarized's touring guitarist), and drummer Danny Gollin. Chuck Dukehart from Sixty Watt Shaman played drums in the band for a year before being replaced by Kenny Wagner, also of Sixty Watt Shaman & Honky, who toured with them and played on "Second Season". The band did U.S. tours & played shows with Clutch, Nashville Pussy, Nebula, CKY, Suplecs, and many others. The band's style has been described as a mixture of Stoner rock, Southern rock and Heavy metal, inspired by Lynyrd Skynyrd and Black Sabbath, among others. They released an album with Alabama Thunderpussy in 2000 and their own debut early the next year. They have released two more albums since. They went on extended hiatus in 2004 but are rumored to be doing another album in 2012 with original line up of Stu, Danny, & Lou on Smallstone Records.
