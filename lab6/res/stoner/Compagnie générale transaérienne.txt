Compagnie générale transaérienne
The Compagnie générale transaérienne (CGT: General Trans-Air Company) was a predecessor of Air France, founded in 1909. At first it operated airships in France and Switzerland, then added float planes and direct flights from Paris to London. It was the first private company to operate an airplane service. After World War I (1914–18) the company faced mounting competition, and in 1921 it was absorbed by a rival. Foundation Louis Blériot registered the statutes of the Compagnie Générale Trans-aérienne (CGT) on 10 October 1909. It was the first French airline, and the first of the companies that would eventually merge to become Air France. The Compagnie générale transaérienne was the second civil airline founded in Europe, and was owned by Henri Deutsch de la Meurthe. The privately owned company would operate airships and, for the first time in the world, airplanes. The engineer Frédéric Airault became the technical director of the airline. Operations CGT built facilities for creating hydrogen gas at Nancy, where the dirigable Ville-de-Nancy was flown at the 1909 Exposition Internationale de l'Est de la France, and then at Beauval. It began offering pleasure trips at Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques, and then Lucerne. CGT operated rigid airships made by Société Astra
