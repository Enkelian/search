Shoot Out the Lights (song)
"Shoot Out the Lights" is a single by heavy metal band Diamond Head released in 1980 by Happy Face Records, the band's own label. It was a single A-side with "Shoot Out the Lights" and "Helpless" as the B-side, and was only available on 7", without a picture sleeve in order to reduce production costs. The latter song was covered by thrash metal band Metallica on their 1987 $5.98 EP: Garage Days Re-revisited EP. An extended version of "Helpless" appeared on Diamond Head's 1980 debut Lightning to the Nations, and "Shoot Out the Lights" eventually appeared on an expanded version of the debut album released in 2001 by Sanctuary Records. The EP received much criticism from heavy metal fans claiming that "it wasn't metal enough." The band, though scoffing at these comments, was seen in live concerts playing more hardcore versions of beloved songs.
