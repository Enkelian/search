Nu Alpha Kappa
Nu Alpha Kappa (ΝΑΚ), is a Latino-based fraternity, which encompasses and values all cultures. Nu Alpha Kappa is the largest Latino-based fraternity on the west coast. Often referred to as "NAK", Nu Alpha Kappa was founded on February 26, 1988 on the campus of California Polytechnic State University, with 28 established chapters across California, Nevada, and Colorado. Nu Alpha Kappa was a charter member of the National Association of Latino Fraternal Organizations (NALFO), but is now a member of the North American Interfraternity Conference. History "Xinaco", a Nahuatl word used by the Olmecs, describes an educated, amiable individual whose personality and charisma transcends and enlightens all cultures and social classes. The "Xinakos" (CHI-Na-Kos) meeting resulted in the creation of a new fraternity. The foundations of the fraternity were started by fifteen good friends at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, California, of which eleven would become founding fathers of the fraternity. This marked the beginning of Nu Alpha Kappa Fraternity, an organization based on the belief of a commitment to "Carnalismo" or brotherhood, the search for knowledge and the retention and pride of culture.
