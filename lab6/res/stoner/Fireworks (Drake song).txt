Fireworks (Drake song)
"Fireworks" is a song by Canadian recording artist Drake from his debut album Thank Me Later. The song features singer Alicia Keys, who previously worked with Drake on the single "Un-Thinkable (I'm Ready)". Originally, it was supposed to be the fourth single, but it was changed to Fancy. Background Fireworks was one of the most anticipated songs off Thank Me Later. It was originally thought that Kings of Leon was on the chorus, however, due to lack of sample clearance, it was announced at a concert that Alicia Keys would sing the chorus.Before his show at Slippery Rock University in Pennsylvania on Monday night April 5, 2010, Drizzy explained to MTV News why he was letting the crowd sample the song. "The song itself is the first song on the album; I think it's the biggest indicator of what the album is gonna be like," he said. "That's why I picked that song to go first, and that's why I wrote the first verse like that. It's really where I am in my life right now. I know they're looking forward to the album, so I want them to get a feel of how the story starts off." "Fireworks" starts
