Something old
"Something old" is the first line of a traditional rhyme that details what a bride should wear at her wedding for good luck: The old item provided protection for the baby to come. The item borrowed from another happy bride provided good luck. The colour blue was a sign of fidelity. The sixpence—a silver British coin—was a symbol of prosperity or acted as a ward against evil done by frustrated suitors. Folklore An 1898 compilation of English folklore recounted that: In this country an old couplet directs that the bride shall wear:—"Something old, something new, Something borrowed, something blue." "The something blue" takes, I am given to understand, usually the form of a garter, an article of dress which plays an important part in some wedding rites, as, for instance, in the old custom of plucking off the garter of the bride. "The something old" and "something blue" are devices to baffle the Evil Eye. The usual effect on the bride of the Evil Eye is to render her barren, and this is obviated by wearing "something borrowed", which should properly be the undergarment of some woman who has been blessed with children: the clothes communicate fertility to the bride.
