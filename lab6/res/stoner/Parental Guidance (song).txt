"Parental Guidance" is the fourth song from the album Turbo by the British heavy metal band Judas Priest that was released on 14 April 1986. The song was released as a single in 1987. It was written and recorded in response to Tipper Gore's attack on the band. Her organization, the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC), placed "Eat Me Alive" (from Defenders of the Faith) at No. 3 on their list of offensive songs (also known as the "Filthy Fifteen"), as it allegedly was about performing oral sex at gunpoint.
