Apparicine
Apparicine is a monoterpenoid indole alkaloid. It is named after Apparicio Duarte, a Brazilian botanist who studied the Aspidosperma species from which apparicine was first isolated. It was the first member of the vallesamine group of alkaloids to be isolated and have its structure established, which was first published in 1965. It has also been known by the synonyms gomezine, pericalline, and tabernoschizine. Biochemistry The alkaloid has been isolated from seven species of Aspidosperma. It is the principal alkaloid found in the callus of Tabernaemontana elegans, and has also been identified in other Tabernaemontana species, including T. africana, T. divaricata, T. orientalis, and T. pachysiphon. In studies of T. pachysiphon, it was found that alkaloid content including that of apparicine was greatest in young leaves and leaves receiving greater shade, and varied with leaf age, plant age, and provenance.Research on Aspidosperma pyricollum has led to the discovery that apparicine is biosynthesised from tryptophan by "loss of C-2 and retention of C-3". The biosynthesis of apparicine requires alteration of the usual tryptamine side chain with loss of C-1. Structure determination Its structure was established through the methods of chemical decomposition, and the nascent field of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) decoupling using
