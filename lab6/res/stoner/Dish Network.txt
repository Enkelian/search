History In January 2008, EchoStar Communications Corporation, which was founded by Charlie Ergen as a satellite television equipment distributor in 1980, changed its name to DISH Network Corporation and spun off its technology arm as a new company, named EchoStar Corporation. The company began using DISH Network as its consumer brand in 1996 after the successful launch of its first satellite, EchoStar I, in December 1995. That launch marked the beginning of its subscription television services. Joseph Clayton became president and chief executive officer
