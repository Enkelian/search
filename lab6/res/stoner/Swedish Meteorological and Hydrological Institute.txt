Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute
The Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (Swedish: Sveriges meteorologiska och hydrologiska institut, abbreviated SMHI) is a Government agency in Sweden and operates under the Ministry of the Environment. SMHI has expertise within the areas of meteorology, hydrology and oceanography, and has extensive service and business operations within these areas. History In 1873, Statens Meteorologiska Centralanstalt was founded, an autonomous part of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, but the first meteorological observations began on July 1, 1874. It was not until 1880 that the first forecasts were issued. The latter will be broadcast on Stockholm radio from 19 February 1924.In 1908, the Hydrographic Office (Hydrografiska byrån, HB) was created. Its task is to scientifically map Sweden's freshwater and collaborate with the weather service in taking certain weather observations such as precipitation and snow cover. In 1919, the two services merged and became the Statens Meteorologisk-Hydrografiska Anstalt (SMHA).In 1945, the service was renamed Sveriges meteorologiska och hydrologiska institut. Prior to 1975 it was located in Stockholm but after a decision taken in the Riksdag in 1971 it was relocated to Norrköping in 1975. Staff and organisation SMHI has offices in Gothenburg, Malmö, Sundsvall and Upplands Väsby, on top of its headquarter.
