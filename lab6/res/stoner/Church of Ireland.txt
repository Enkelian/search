Church of Ireland
The Church of Ireland (Irish: Eaglais na h√âireann; Ulster-Scots: Kirk o Airlann) is a Christian church in Ireland and an autonomous province of the Anglican Communion. It is organised on an all-Ireland basis and is the second largest Christian church on the island after the Catholic Church.

In theological and liturgical matters, it incorporates many principles of the Reformation, particularly those espoused during the English Reformation.
