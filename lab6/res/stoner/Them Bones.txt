Them Bones
"Them Bones" is a song by the American rock band Alice in Chains. It is the opening track and the second single from their second album, Dirt (1992). The song was also included on the compilation albums Nothing Safe: Best of the Box (1999), Music Bank (1999), Greatest Hits (2001), The Essential Alice in Chains (2006). A live performance of the song is included on their live album entitled Live (2000). Structure The song was written by guitarist Jerry Cantrell. The chromatic riff is played in a time signature of 78—except for the chorus, which is in 44. When discussing the use of odd time signatures in a 1998 interview with Guitar World, Cantrell said: "I really don't know where that comes from; it just comes naturally to me. I could sit down and figure it out, but what's the use? Off-time stuff is just more exciting — it takes people by surprise when you shift gears like that before they even know what the hell hit 'em. It's also effective when you slow something down and then slam 'em into the dash. A lot of Alice stuff is written that way — 'Them Bones' is a great off-time song."
