RTÉ One
RTÉ One (Irish: RTÉ a hAon) is the main television channel of Irish state-owned broadcaster, Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ), and it is the most-popular and most-watched television channel in Ireland. It was launched as Telefís Éireann on 31 December 1961, it was renamed RTÉ in 1966, and it was renamed as RTÉ 1 upon the launch of RTÉ 2 in 1978. It is funded partly by the government's licence fee; the remainder of the funding is provided by commercial advertising. Because RTÉ is funded partly by the licence fee it shows considerably fewer advertisements than most other channels available in Ireland and Northern Ireland. RTÉ One is available to 98% of the Irish population in HD on the Saorview DTT service. It is also available in Northern Ireland via Saorview overspill, the UK Freeview service, satellite provider Sky, and cable provider Virgin Media.
