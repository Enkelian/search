For other uses, see Calf (disambiguation)The calf (Latin: sura, plural calves) is the back portion of the lower leg in human anatomy. The muscles within the calf correspond to the posterior compartment of the leg.

Structure The calf is composed of the muscles of the posterior compartment of the leg: The gastrocnemius and soleus (composing the triceps surae muscle) and the tibialis posterior. The sural nerve
