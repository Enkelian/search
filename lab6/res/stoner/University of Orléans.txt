St. Yves (1253–1303) studied civil law at Orléans, and Pope Clement V also studied there law and letters; by a Papal Bull published at Lyon, 27 January 1306, he endowed the Orléans institutes with the title and privileges of a University (it has been founded as one of the very earliest universities outside Italy in 1235, only two years after Cambridge, in France only Paris' Sorbonne was even older). Twelve later popes granted the new university many privileges. In the 14th century it had as many as five thousand students from France, Germany, Lorraine, Burgundy, Champagne, Picardy, Normandy, Touraine, Guyenne and Scotland. The current university was founded in 1960,
