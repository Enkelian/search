Subsequently, he signed with Olympiacos F.C. in the summer of 2005, competing with young Kleopas Giannou for the substitute role behind regular Antonios Nikopolidis.Lemmens did not manage to play one single game with the Greek, being demoted to third-choice in 2006–07 upon the signing of Tomislav Butina. On 31 January 2007 he was finally released by the club, quickly joining Netherlands' RKC Waalwijk on a free transfer; on 10 February he played his first Eredivisie game, against Heracles Almelo.Lemmens
