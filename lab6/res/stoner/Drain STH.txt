Drain STH
Drain STH (STH for Stockholm) was a rock band from Sweden. Biography Stockholm quartet Drain STH underwent many changes in both musical style and image. Guitarist Flavia Canel and drummer Martina Axén had been together in many acts starting with punk band Livin' Sacrifice (not to be confused with the thrash metal band Living Sacrifice). As this act progressed the sound developed into more of a hard rock vein. Livin' Sacrifice evolved into Aphrodite with Axén, Canel, vocalist Malin Ekholm, guitarist Maria "Mia" Landberg, and bassist Marianne Hall. Aphrodite folded upon Ekholm's departure in 1990. Axén, Canel and Anna K formed a new band called Ragdoll in 1991 that included vocalist Annie Gutå. With Gutås's departure, Axén, Canel and Anna K joined forces with former Necro Nancy guitarist-turned-vocalist Maria Sjöholm (later wife of Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi). They changed the name to Drain and signed a deal with MVG Records in 1994. For the American market the band was known as Drain STH. Live promotion in North America included second stage appearances at the Ozzfest event in 1997 and 1999, and tours with Type O Negative, Corrosion of Conformity, Machine Head, Megadeth, Godsmack and Black Sabbath among others.
