Star Theatres
Star Theatres was a movie theatre chain owned and operated by Loews Cineplex Entertainment and AMC Theatres. Based solely in Michigan, Star was known for having extravagant interior designs, many screens, and in some cases, stadium-style seating. The chain made the Summer 1990 Entertainment Weekly Honor Roll for movie theaters with the late Detroit Free Press critic Kathy Huffhines declaring, "IT'S FRIENDLY, kicky, and cute and looks like a bright red-and-white jukebox from the outside."The chain came to prominence in the late 1980s and early 1990s as more audiences chose to view films at a megaplex. Over time, some locations shut down or moved, while others thrived. The Southfield, Michigan and Auburn Hills, Michigan locations were considered the flagships of the chain and remained very popular with local movie-goers, but were rebranded as AMC theatres in 2018. The slogan was "Love*Laugh*Live" and "Larger than Life".In 2018, all locations were rebranded as AMC theatres. The Southfield location was permanently closed in 2020.
