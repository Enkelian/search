Southern Lord Records
Southern Lord is an American heavy metal record label that was founded in 1998 by Greg Anderson. Initially, Southern Lord specialized in what could broadly be classified as experimental metal, particularly the slow-moving doom metal, stoner rock, and drone metal subgenres. Some of the more notable artists on the label include Baptists, Earth, Om, Goatsnake, Khanate, Obliterations, Pelican, Sleep, Boris and Sunn O))), among others. More recently, the label expanded its line-up to include artists from the black metal subgenre, including releases by Twilight, Wolves in the Throne Room, Xasthur, and Striborg. They have also released albums by hardcore punk and crust punk bands like Burning Love, Agrimonia, and Wolfbrigade. History In the mid-90s, in post-grunge Seattle, two friends in their mid-20s were being influenced by the Melvins‘ sludge and Earth‘s suffocating brand of doom. Greg Anderson and Stephen O’Malley, of Thorr’s Hammer and Burning Witch, would tread their own paths after the demise of those bands, only to be brought back together in Los Angeles in 1998. In a new city, at the dawn of a new decade, the two would form a new band and launch Southern Lord Records with the primary goal of releasing their own material.
