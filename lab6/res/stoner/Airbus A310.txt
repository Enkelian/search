Airbus A310
The Airbus A310 is a wide-body airliner developed and manufactured by Airbus, then a consortium of European aerospace manufacturers. Airbus had demand for an aircraft smaller than the A300, the first Twinjet wide-body. On 7 July 1978, the A310 (initially the A300B10) was launched with orders from Swissair and Lufthansa. On 3 April 1982, the first prototype conducted its maiden flight and it received its type certification on 11 March 1983. Keeping the same eight-abreast cross-section, the A310 is 6.95 m (22.8 ft) shorter than the initial A300 variants, and has a smaller 219 m2 (2,360 sq ft) wing, down from 260 m2 (2,800 sq ft). The A310 introduced a two-crew glass cockpit, later adopted for the A300-600 with a common type rating. It was powered by the same General Electric CF6-80 or Pratt & Whitney JT9D then PW4000 turbofans. It can seat 220 passengers in two classes, or 240 in all-economy, and can fly up to 5,150 nmi (9,540 km). It has overwing exits between the two main front and rear door pairs. In April 1983, the aircraft entered revenue service with Swissair and competed with the Boeing 767-200, introduced six months before. Its longer range and ETOPS regulations
