Lord Mayor of Dublin
The Lord Mayor of Dublin (Irish: Ardmhéara Bhaile Átha Cliath) is the honorary title of the chairman (Irish: Cathaoirleach, Irish pronunciation: [ˈkahiːɾˠlʲəx]) of Dublin City Council which is the local government body for the city of Dublin, the capital of Ireland. The incumbent is councillor Tom Brabazon. The office holder is elected annually by the members of the Council. Background The office of Mayor of Dublin was created in June 1229 by Henry III. The office of Mayor was elevated to Lord Mayor in 1665 by Charles II, and as part of this process received the honorific The Right Honourable (The Rt Hon.). Lords Mayor were ex-officio members of the Privy Council of Ireland, which also entitled them to be addressed The Right Honourable. Though the Privy Council was de facto abolished in 1922, the Lord Mayor continued to be entitled to be addressed as The Right Honourable as a result of the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840, which granted the title in law. The Local Government Act 2001 finally removed the title as a consequence of the repeal of the 1840 act. Functions The office is largely symbolic and its responsibilities consist of chairing meetings of the city council
