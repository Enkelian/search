Northern Lights Festival Boréal
Northern Lights Festival Boréal is an annual music festival in Greater Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. It is one of Canada's oldest music festivals in continuous operation, having been staged every year since 1972; although the Mariposa Folk Festival is nominally older, that festival was not staged in 1980 or 1981. The bilingual festival is held in Bell Park, including the Grace Hartman Amphitheatre, on the shore of the city's Ramsey Lake. It presents a diverse program of music in a variety of genres, arts, crafts and children's entertainment, typically featuring a mix of national, international and local artists and performers. Musicians at the festival typically participate in both conventional concert performances and "workshop" sessions collaborating with several other musicians. In addition to the main festival, the organizing committee also sponsors a number of concerts and other cultural events in the city throughout the year; during the festival weekend, an additional lineup of local artists also performs downtown at the Towne House rather than at the park site. The festival is usually held on the first weekend in July, although it was postponed until the last weekend of the month in 1988 to serve as the cultural festival for the 1988 World
