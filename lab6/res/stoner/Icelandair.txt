It is part of the Icelandair Group and as of April 2018, operated scheduled services to 48 cities in 16 countries on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean from its hub at Keflavík International Airport. The geographical position of Iceland is convenient for one-stop transatlantic flights, which is one pillar of the airline's business strategy, along with traffic to and from the country.

Previously, two unrelated airlines of the same name had existed in the country (from 1919 to 1920, and between 1928 and 1931). For international purposes, the name Iceland Airways was adopted.The fleet was expanded with a Beechcraft
