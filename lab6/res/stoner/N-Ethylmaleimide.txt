N-Ethylmaleimide
N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM) is an organic compound that is derived from maleic acid. It contains the amide functional group, but more importantly it is an alkene that is reactive toward thiols and is commonly used to modify cysteine residues in proteins and peptides. Organic chemistry NEM is a Michael Acceptor in Michael Reaction, which means that it adds nucleophiles such as thiols. The resulting thioether features a strong C-S bond and the reaction is virtually irreversible. Reaction with thiols occur in the pH range 6.5â€“7.5, NEM may react with amines or undergo hydrolysis at a more alkaline pH. NEM has been widely used to probe the functional role of thiol groups in enzymology. NEM is an irreversible inhibitor of all cysteine peptidases, with alkylation occurring at the active site thiol group (see schematic). Case studies NEM blocks vesicular transport. In lysis buffers, 20 to 25 mM of NEM is used to inhibit de-sumoylation of proteins for Western Blot analysis. NEM has also been used as an inhibitor of deubiquitinases. N-Ethylmaleimide was used by Arthur Kornberg and colleagues to knock out DNA polymerase III in order to compare its activity to that of DNA polymerase I (pol III and I, respectively). Kornberg
