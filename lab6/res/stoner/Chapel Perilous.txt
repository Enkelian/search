Film Pulse scored the film 7.5 out of 10 and said that "Chapel Perilous is the type of short film that leaves you wanting more by the end. It doesn't lay all its cards on the table, and only gives you the bare minimum amount of information. The viewer is left to draw his or her own conclusions about the craziness that just transpired, but I can't help but think how much fun this could be as a feature film."
