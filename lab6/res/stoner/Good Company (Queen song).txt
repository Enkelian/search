Good Company (Queen song)
"Good Company" is a song by British rock band Queen, which was written by Brian May. May also played a "Genuine Aloha" Banjo uke and provided all the vocals on the track. Composition and lyrics One of the main features of the song is that it contains a recreation of a jazz band in Dixieland style which was provided by May's Red Special guitar played through the Deacy Amp. This is one of the few Queen songs without Freddie Mercury participating at all. The song tells a story about a man who was advised in young age by his father to "take care of those you call your own, and keep good company". The young man accepts the advice, marrying a girl named Sally and also keeping his friends. However, he began losing interest in his friends after the marriage and they gradually disappear. As he is older, he is becoming more skilled and dedicated to his occupation by working long nights and neglecting his family. In the end, all his efforts is rewarded and he begins his own Limited company (it also serves as a pun; the word "company" mainly serves as a meaning of friends, companions). Dedicated more
