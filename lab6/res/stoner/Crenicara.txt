These cichlids have several dark spots on the sides of their bodies, and do not surpass 10 cm (3.9 in) in length. In the past, the members of the genus Dicrossus were sometimes included in Crenicara. Members of both genera are sometimes known as checkerboard or chessboard cichlids. Species The two recognized species in this genus are: Crenicara latruncularium S. O.
