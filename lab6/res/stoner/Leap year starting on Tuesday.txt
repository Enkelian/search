Leap year starting on Tuesday
A leap year starting on Tuesday is any year with 366 days (i.e. it includes 29 February) that begins on Tuesday, 1 January, and ends on Wednesday, 31 December. Its dominical letters hence are FE, such as the years 1828, 1856, 1884, 1924, 1952, 1980, 2008, 2036, 2064, 2092, 2104 and 2132 in the Gregorian calendar or, likewise, 1964, 1992, and 2020 (the current year) in the obsolete Julian calendar. Any leap year that starts on Tuesday, Friday or Saturday has only one Friday the 13th; the only Friday the 13th in this leap year occurs in June. Common years starting on Wednesday share this characteristic. Calendars Applicable years Gregorian Calendar Leap years that begin on Tuesday, like those that start on Wednesday, occur at a rate of approximately 14.43% of all total leap years in a 400-year cycle of the Gregorian calendar. Their overall occurrence is 3.5% (14 out of 400). Julian Calendar Like all leap year types, the one starting with 1 January on a Tuesday occurs exactly once in a 28-year cycle in the Julian calendar, i.e. in 3.57% of years. As the Julian calendar repeats after 28 years that means it will also repeat after 700
