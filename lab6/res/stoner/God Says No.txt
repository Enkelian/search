God Says No
God Says No is the fifth studio album by Monster Magnet, released in 2000 in the UK and 2001 in the US (the two versions differ slightly in their track listings, see below). It was a commercial failure compared to their previous album, Powertrip. It was their last release recorded for A&M Records, due to problems with promotion of the album but it reached #17 in Germany. It would also be the last release with bassist Joe Calandra and drummer Jon Kleiman. The track "Medicine", which appears on the U.S. release, is a re-recording of a track which originally appeared on the band's 1991 album Spine of God. A music video was made for the 1991 version. Two different music videos were produced for the song "Heads Explode" and one for "Melt", consisting mostly of live footage over the studio version of the track.
