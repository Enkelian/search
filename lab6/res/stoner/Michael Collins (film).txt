Michael Collins is a 1996 biographical period drama film written and directed by Neil Jordan and starring Liam Neeson as Michael Collins, the Irish patriot and revolutionary who died in the Irish Civil War. It won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. Plot The film opens in medias res in 1922 immediately after Michael Collins' death, as Joe O'Reilly, a long-time comrade of Collins, attempts to console a mourning Kitty Kiernan. The story shifts back to the closing years of Britain's rule over Ireland from its base in Dublin Castle, when Irish Republicans fight for Irish independence against Britain and its military and police forces. At the end of the Easter Rising in 1916, Collins, Harry Boland, Ã‰amon de Valera, and other besieged Irish rebels at the Dublin GPO surrender to the British Army. As the Dublin Metropolitan Police's G Division (counter-insurgency squad) identifies leaders of the uprising, Collins tells Boland that next time, "We won't play by their rules, Harry. We'll invent our own." Multiple leaders involved the fighting (Patrick Pearse, Thomas MacDonagh, Tom Clarke and James Connolly depicted) die by firing squad at Kilmainham Gaol, but de Valera, an American citizen, is imprisoned, as are Collins,
