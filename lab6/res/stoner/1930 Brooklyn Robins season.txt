1930 Brooklyn Robins season
The 1930 Brooklyn Robins were in first place from mid-May through mid-August but faded down the stretch and finished the season in fourth place. Offseason February 5, 1930: Doug McWeeny was traded by the Robins to the Cincinnati Reds for Dolf Luque. Regular season This team featured one of the best offensive players in the game in Babe Herman and one of the best pitchers in Hall of Famer Dazzy Vance. Herman was arguably the second-best National League hitter in 1930, after Hack Wilson. He finished in the top three in batting average, on-base percentage, and slugging percentage. Vance was even more impressive. He led the NL in ERA by more than a full run, at 2.61. Considering that 1930 was a great year for hitters, statistically, this number is far better than it actually seems. Vance was also second in strikeouts and anchored a pitching staff that allowed the fewest runs in the league.
