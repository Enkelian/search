Royal Photographic Society
The Royal Photographic Society of Great Britain, commonly known as the Royal Photographic Society (RPS), is one of the world's oldest photographic societies. It was founded in London, England, in 1853 as the Photographic Society of London with the objective of promoting the art and science of photography, and in 1853 received Royal patronage from Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. On 25 June 2019, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge became the Society's Patron, taking over from Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II who had been patron since 1952.A change to the society's name to reflect the Royal patronage was, however, not considered expedient at the time. In 1874 it was renamed the Photographic Society of Great Britain, and from 1894 it became known as the Royal Photographic Society of Great Britain. A registered charity since 1962, in July 2004, The Royal Photographic Society of Great Britain was granted a Royal charter recognising its eminence in the field of photography as a learned society. For most of its history the Society was based at various premises in London. It moved to Bath in 1979, where it remained until 2019. In January 2019, the society opened its new headquarters and gallery in Bristol, England.
