Augmented-fourths tuning
Among alternative tunings for guitar, each augmented-fourths tuning is a regular tuning in which the musical intervals between successive open-string notes are each augmented fourths. Because augmented fourths are alternatively called "tritones" ("tri-tones") or "diminished fifths", augmented-fourths tuning is also called tritone tuning or diminished-fifths tuning. The standard guitar-tuning E-A-d-g-b'-e'interjects exactly one major third amid four perfect fourths for the intervals between its successive open strings. In contrast, the augmented fourths tunings C-F♯-c-f♯-c'-f '♯ and B-F-b-f-b'-f'have only augmented-fourths intervals. The set of augmented-fourths tunings has three properties that simplify learning by beginners and improvisation by experts: Regular intervals, string repetition, and lefty-righty symmetry. These properties characterize augmented-fourths tunings among non-trivial tunings. Properties The set of augmented-fourths tunings has three properties that simplify learning by beginners and improvisation by experts: Regular intervals, string repetition, and lefty-righty symmetry.Besides the set of augmented-fourths tuning, exactly one other set of tunings has these three properties—the trivial class of one-note tunings, which contains the C-C-C-C-C-C tuning, for example.Augmented-fourths tunings have extended range. Because each of its tritone-intervals between successive strings is wider than the perfect-fourth intervals (and one major third) of standard tuning, augmented-fourths tunings have greater range than standard tuning—six additional notes, only one
