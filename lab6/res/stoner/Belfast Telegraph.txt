The Belfast Telegraph is a daily newspaper published in Belfast, Northern Ireland, by Independent News & Media. Reflecting its unionist tradition, the paper has historically been "favoured by the Protestant population", while also being read within Catholic nationalist communities in Northern Ireland.

Its first edition cost half a penny and ran to four pages covering the Franco-Prussian War and local news. The evening edition of the newspaper was originally called the "Sixth Late", and "Sixth Late Tele" was a familiar cry made by vendors in Belfast City Centre in the past. Its competitors are The News Letter and The Irish News but local editions of London-based red tops also compete in this market, selling at a cheaper price than the "Tele".

The weekday morning compact edition was launched on 22 March 2005.In 2015, the Telegraph launched the magazine supplement Family Life.The paper now publishes two editions daily, Belfast Telegraph final edition and the North West
