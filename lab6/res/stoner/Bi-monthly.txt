Bi-monthly
Bimonthly is a term defining frequency. It generally means "every two months", especially in commercial and British usage, based on the prefix Bi- meaning 2. It thus contrasts with semimonthly which means "two times every month". It is also still used, though more rarely, to have the same meaning as semimonthly, causing considerable confusion.The corresponding concepts are not confused in, for example, French, with bimestriel meaning every 2 months, and bimensuel meaning twice a month. == Notes ==
