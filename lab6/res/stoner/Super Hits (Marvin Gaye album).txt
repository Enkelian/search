The New Rolling Stone Record Guide (1983) gave Super Hits four out of five stars.A similarly titled compilation album was released in 2001 by Legacy Records and Sony Music, which The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004) warned was "not the wonderful 1970 Motown collection, now deleted, but a budget set of Midnight Love material."
