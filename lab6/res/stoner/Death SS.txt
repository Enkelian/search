Death SS
Death SS (later also intended as a contraction of In Death of Steve Sylvester) is an Italian heavy metal band. Biography Death SS was formed in 1977 in Pesaro by Steve Sylvester (born Stefano Silvestri), a future member of the Ordo Templi Orientis, and Paul Chain (Paolo Catena), who would later embrace an experimental form of doom metal with his solo project, Paul Chain Violet Theatre. The band combined elements of horror, occultism and heavy metal to become a pioneer in horror metal and black metal; the musical style is called “horror music” by the band. Sylvester left the band in 1982 and Chain replaced him with Sanctis Ghoram (featured on the Evil Metal EP) before closing the project in 1984 to start his solo career. Sylvester reformed the band in 1988 (with him being the only original member). This new incarnation of the band recorded their first full-length album, ...in Death of Steve Sylvester. There would be many line-up changes in the years to come, with Sylvester once again being the only constant. The album Panic was partially recorded in the US, with Neil Kernon as a producer, because the band liked his work for artists like Queensrÿche, Judas
