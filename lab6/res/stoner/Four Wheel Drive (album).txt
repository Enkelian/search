Four Wheel Drive is the fourth studio album by Canadian rock band Bachman–Turner Overdrive, released in 1975 (see 1975 in music). It peaked at No. 1 in Canada on the RPM national albums chart on October 4 and again on October 18, 1975 while hitting No. 5 on the U.S. Pop Albums chart. The most popular single from the album, "Hey You," was written by Randy Bachman. It reached No. 1 in Canada, holding the top position on the RPM national singles chart for two weeks in June, 1975, and No. 21 on the U.S. charts. Some reviews stated the song was directed at Bachman's former Guess Who bandmate, Burton Cummings.According to liner notes supplied with the BTO compilation CD The Anthology, Mercury Records had wanted a quick follow-up to the highly successful Not Fragile album. Thus, Four-Wheel Drive was recorded in six days, much of it containing material that was left over from the Not Fragile sessions.This album is currently in print.
