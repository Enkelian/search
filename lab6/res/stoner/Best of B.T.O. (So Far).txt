A remastered version was released in 1998, titled Best of B.T.O. (Remastered Hits), which added the tracks "Four Wheel Drive", "Free Wheelin'", and "Down to the Line". The European issue added another six tracks. All songs were also full-length album versions, though in the U.S. the single edit of "Let It Ride" was used.
