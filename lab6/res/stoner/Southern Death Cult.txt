Southern Death Cult
Southern Death Cult were a British post-punk/gothic rock band in the early 1980s. They are now primarily known for having given their lead singer and parts of the name to the multi-platinum hard rock band the Cult. Despite the similarities in the names, "Southern Death Cult" were distinct from "Death Cult"/"the Cult". History Southern Death Cult formed in 1981 in Bradford, Yorkshire, with a lineup of vocalist Ian Astbury, bassist Barry Jepson, guitarist David "Buzz" Burrows and drummer Haq Nawaz "Aky" Qureshi. The group's name derived from an old term for the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex, a mound-building Native American culture (and the band were also known for their use of Native American imagery), but it also served as a critique of the imbalance of power in the English North-South divide.The first Southern Death Cult show took place on 29 October 1981 at the Queen's Hall in Bradford.The band's debut, the double A-side 7" single "Moya/Fatman", also referred to as The Southern Death Cult, was released in December 1982 on the Situation Two label (an offshoot of Beggars Banquet Records) and hit No. 1 on the UK Indie Chart. The 12" version included a third track, "The Girl". Southern Death Cult
