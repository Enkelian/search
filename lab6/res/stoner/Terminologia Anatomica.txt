Terminologia Anatomica
Terminologia Anatomica (TA) is the international standard on human anatomic terminology. It was developed by the Federative Committee on Anatomical Terminology (FCAT) and the International Federation of Associations of Anatomists (IFAA) and was released in 1998. It supersedes the previous standard, Nomina Anatomica. Terminologia Anatomica contains terminology for about 7500 human gross (macroscopic) anatomical structures. In April 2011, Terminologia Anatomica was published online by the Federative International Programme on Anatomical Terminologies (FIPAT), the successor of FCAT. Categories of anatomical structures The TA divides anatomical structures into the following main categories (Latin standard in parentheses) : A01: General anatomy (anatomia generalis) General terms (anatomia generalissima)Parts of human body Planes, lines and regions A02: Bones (ossa) General termsCranium Bones of cranium Vertebral column Bones of upper limb Bones of lower limb A03: Joints (juncturae) General termsJoints of skull Vertebral joints Thoracic joint Joints of pelvic girdle Joints of upper limb Joints of lower limb A04: Muscles (musculi) General termsMuscles of head Muscles of neck Muscles of back Muscles of thorax Muscles of abdomen Muscles of upper limb Muscles of lower limb Tendon sheaths and bursae A05: Alimentary system (systema digestorium) Mouth Fauces Pharynx Oesophagus Stomach Small intestine Large intestine Liver, Gallbladder Pancreas
