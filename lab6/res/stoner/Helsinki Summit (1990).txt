Helsinki Summit (1990)
The Helsinki Summit comprised a meeting between US President George H. W. Bush and Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, taking place on September 9, 1990, just a few weeks before the reunification of Germany as their fourth meeting following a meeting that included Ronald Reagan, in New York in December 1988. Furthermore, the collapse of communism and the pending reunification of Germany necessitated a third summit meeting of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe in order to formally end the Cold War.
