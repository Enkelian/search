Volt
The volt (symbol: V) is the derived unit for electric potential, electric potential difference (voltage), and electromotive force. It is named after the Italian physicist Alessandro Volta (1745–1827). Definition One volt is defined as the difference in electric potential between two points of a conducting wire when an electric current of one ampere dissipates one watt of power between those points. Additionally, it is the potential difference between two points that will impart one joule of energy per coulomb of charge that passes through it. It can be expressed in terms of SI base units (m, kg, s, and A) as: V = potential energy charge = J C = kg ⋅ m 2 A ⋅ s 3 . {\displaystyle {\text{V}}={\frac {\text{potential energy}}{\text{charge}}}={\frac {\text{J}}{\text{C}}}={\frac {{\text{kg}}{\cdot }{\text{m}}^{2}}{{\text{A}}{\cdot }{\text{s}}^{3}}}.} It can also be expressed as amperes times ohms (current times resistance, Ohm's law), webers per second (magnetic flux per time), watts per ampere (power per unit current, definition of electric power), or joules per coulomb (energy per unit charge), which is also equivalent to electronvolts per elementary charge: V = A ⋅ Ω = Wb s = W A = J C = eV e . {\displaystyle {\text{V}}={\text{A}}{\cdot }\Omega ={\frac {\text{Wb}}{\text{s}}}={\frac {\text{W}}{\text{A}}}={\frac
