The company’s cymbal production is one of the "big four" manufacturers of cymbals, along with Zildjian, Sabian, and Paiste.In addition to cymbals, Meinl manufactures a very wide range of percussion instruments including bongo drums, cajons, congas, djembes, güiros, pandeiros, and tambourines. History The "Roland Meinl Musikinstrumente" was founded in 1951 by Roland Meinl. Initially the company produced wind instruments, beginning the production of cymbals only in 1952. The first Meinl cymbals were cut out of large metal sheets, hammered, lathed and drilled by hand by Roland Meinl himself, who subsequently transported them to the Neustadt an der Aisch railstation on the luggage carrier of his bike.In the 1960s about half of the production was exported to the United States together with German-made Tromsa drumsets. The first employee, Gustav Strobel, was hired in 1964 and worked for the company for almost 40 years. At about the same time Roland Meinl began to import affordable music instruments from Japan, being one of the first Pearl importers in Europe. He later began to import Tama and Ibanez instruments.In 1974 Meinl was the first cymbal company to offer pre-pack cymbal sets. Meinl's
