Boing (French TV channel)
Boing is a French pay television channel aimed at children and teenagers, which launched on April 8, 2010. It is a localization of the original Italian network meant for broadcast in France and French-speaking countries within Africa, and is fully owned by Warner Bros. Entertainment through its Global Kids & Young Adults division. Unlike its Italian counterpart, it excludes Mediaset (possibly due to La Cinq, France's first privately owned free television network, suffering a financial collapse ceasing operations on 12 April 1992).
