USS Baton Rouge (SSN-689)
USS Baton Rouge (SSN-689) was a Los Angeles-class nuclear-powered attack submarine which served with the United States Navy. With her keel laid down on 18 November 1972, Baton Rouge was launched on 26 April 1975. She became the second Los Angeles-class submarine to be commissioned, on 25 June 1977. In 1995, she was the first of her class to be decommissioned, after a collision with a Russian Sierra-class submarine. Baton Rouge was the first and currently only ship of the United States Navy to be named for Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Design Baton Rouge was a nuclear attack submarine and, as such, was optimized for anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and strike operations.

The latter has a range of either 280 or 1,600 miles (450 or 2,500 km), depending on whether it is anti-ship or strike variant, and is nuclear-compatible, although this capability is deployed on Los Angeles-class submarines. Since the boat did not incorporate the vertical launching system found on later Los Angeles-class submarines, the Harpoons and Tomahawks were torpedo
