Uriah Heep Live is a double live album by British rock group Uriah Heep, released in April 1973 in the US by Mercury Records, and in May 1973 in the UK by Bronze Records. It was the band's first live album. The album was recorded by the Pye Mobile Unit, with Alan Perkins as engineer. In addition to a live version of the band's hit "Easy Livin'", the record included live cuts such as "Sweet Lorraine", "Sunrise" and an extended live version of "July Morning". While the band was on tour in the United States, the album reached No. 13 in the UK Albums Chart.The original album packaging, as typical in early 1970s rock music, featured a gatefold sleeve and centre pages featuring photographs of the band members. Uriah Heep Live was certified gold by the RIAA on 12 October 1973; it was the band's third US gold album.Mercury initially re-released the album on CD in 1989 without the medley, due to time constraints. This was restored on all later editions, including the reissues in 1990 by Castle Communications and 2010 by Sanctuary Records.
