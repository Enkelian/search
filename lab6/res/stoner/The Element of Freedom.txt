The Element of Freedom
The Element of Freedom is the fourth studio album by American singer and songwriter Alicia Keys, released on December 11, 2009, by J Records. Recording sessions for the album took place during May to September 2009 at The Oven Studios in Long Island, New York. Production was primarily handled by Keys, Kerry Brothers, Jr., and Jeff Bhasker. Departing from the classicist soul music of Keys' previous albums, The Element of Freedom has a mid-tempo, low-key sound and features mostly ballads. The album debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 417,000 copies in its first week. It became Keys' first number-one album in the United Kingdom. The Element of Freedom was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) within its first month of release and produced five singles that attained chart success. Upon its release, the album received generally positive reviews from music critics, who complimented its low-key style, cohesiveness, and Keys' singing, while some were ambivalent towards the lyrics. By August 2012, The Element of Freedom had sold over four million copies worldwide. It is the 148th best selling album of the 2010s. Background After recording her third studio album, As I Am,
