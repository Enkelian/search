Big Idea Entertainment
Big Idea Entertainment, LLC (formerly known as Big Idea Productions, Inc. and Big Idea, Inc.; also simply as Big Idea) is an American Christian animation studio best known for its computer-animated VeggieTales series of Christian-themed home videos. Founded in February 1989 as GRAFx Studios by Phil Vischer, the company was renamed as Big Idea Productions in August 1993 and released its first direct-to-video VeggieTales program by December. In 2002, Big Idea adapted the Biblical story of Jonah for its first theatrical feature film, Jonah: A VeggieTales Movie, which was co-produced with FHE Pictures. Its second theatrical film, The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie, was co-produced with Starz Animation and released in 2008. At present, the company is a subsidiary of DreamWorks Classics, which in turn is owned by DreamWorks Animation, a subsidiary of NBCUniversal, a division of Comcast. As soon as VeggieTales was cancelled in March 2018, its headquarters in Nashville closed, but some of the company's operations continued. NBCUniversal eventually reopened Big Idea Entertainment in 2019 and allowed them to create more VeggieTales content (including a reboot) without DreamWorks' involvement.
