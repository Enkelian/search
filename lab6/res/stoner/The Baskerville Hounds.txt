The Baskerville Hounds
The Baskerville Hounds are an American garage rock group from the West Park neighborhood of Cleveland, Ohio. In October 1969 (not to be confused by the punk band Hound Baskerville) They had a single hit on the Billboard top-100: "Hold Me" which peaked at #88 and was on the charts for two weeks.The band was formed as the Majestics in 1963 by Doug McCutcheon – keyboards, Larry Meese – guitar; and John Kirkpatrick – drums. They brought in Bill Emery on bass in January 1964 and Dante Rossi – rhythm guitar in July 1964. They were renamed the Dantes, then the Tulu Babies, then finally the Baskerville Hounds. Active from 1964 through 1972, the band became WHK radio's house band for major acts. In 1965 they released their first single, "Hurtin' Kind", written by Doug McCutcheon, backed with "Mine Forever", a Larry Meese original. Their instrumental “Space Rock Part 2” was featured as theme music on the Ghoulardi television show. They opened for The Rolling Stones, Sonny & Cher, Beach Boys, Dave Clark 5, and many other top acts. Mike Macron replaced John Kirkpatrick on drums after Kirkpatrick was drafted in 1966. Several other musicians joined the band for short
