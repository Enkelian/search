Ninety One plc
Ninety One plc is an asset management business. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index. History The company was formed as Investec Asset Management in 1991. It changed its name to Ninety One in spring 2020: the new name is in recognition of the brand's heritage - it was in 1991 that the investment firm was started in South Africa. It was demerged from Investec in March 2020. It had been envisaged that 10% of the stock would be offered to the public but Investec decided to retain 25% (rather than just 15% as originally planned) because of market conditions. == References ==
