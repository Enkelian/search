John McKay (football coach)
John Harvey McKay (July 5, 1923 – June 10, 2001) was an American football coach. He was the head football coach at the University of Southern California (USC) from 1960 to 1975 and head coach of the National Football League's Tampa Bay Buccaneers from 1976 to 1984. In 16 seasons at USC, McKay compiled a record of 127–40–8 and won nine AAWU/Pac-8 conference titles. His teams made eight appearances in the Rose Bowl, with five wins. Four of his squads captured national titles (1962, 1967, 1972, 1974). Following a disappointing 1975 season, McKay moved to the NFL as the first head coach of the expansion Tampa Bay Buccaneers. In 1976 and 1977, Tampa Bay lost the first 26 games, but improved by the end of the 1970s. The Bucs made the playoffs three times under McKay, including an appearance in the NFC Championship Game in 1979. McKay was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1988. On January 1, 2014, McKay was named the All-Century Coach of the Rose Bowl Game during the celebration of the 100th Rose Bowl Game. His son represented him in the 2014 Rose Parade.
