Hampton Gay
Hampton Gay is a village in the Cherwell Valley about 1.5 miles (2.4 km) north of Kidlington, Oxfordshire. Archaeology In 1972 a cast bronze clasp was found at Hampton Gay near St Giles' parish church. It is decorated with stylised Acanthus leaves and may be late Saxon, from the 10th or 11th century. Manor After the Norman Conquest of England Robert D'Oyly gave an estate of three hides at Hampton Gay to his brother in arms Roger d'Ivry, while a second estate of two hides at Hampton Gay belonged to the Crown. D'Ivry's holding became part of the honour of St. Valery, which in the 13th century was owned by Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall. Under his successor Edmund, 2nd Earl of Cornwall towards the end of the 13th century the d'Ivry holding was merged with the Duchy of Cornwall. The royal estate at Hampton Gay became part of the honour of Gloucester and thereby followed the same descent as the manor of Finmere.The Domesday Book of 1086 records that one Rainald was the tenant of both the d'Ivry and the royal estate. The de Gay family were tenants of both estates by about 1137 and remained so until 1222.
