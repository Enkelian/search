Friedrich Ludwig Jahn Sportpark
The Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Stadion at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark is a sports stadium in the Prenzlauer Berg locality in Berlin. It is bordered on the south by Eberswalder Straße, on the north by the Max Schmeling Halle, on the west by Mauerpark, where part of the Berlin Wall once stood. The complex includes a football and athletics stadium as well as several smaller sports fields. With a capacity of approximately 20,000 seats, 15,000 which are covered, the stadium is the third largest in the city after Berlin's Olympiastadion and Stadion An der Alten Försterei. The stadium has been used temporarily by various Berlin football sides, BFC Dynamo currently being the primary tenant of the stadium, following its 2014 advance to the Regionalliga Nordost. Other tentants are VSG Altglienicke and Berlin Adler. Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark was the venue for the 2018 World Para Athletics European Championships. History Since 1825, the area was used as the drill grounds of the Guard Regiment of the Prussian army. Some housing was constructed on the site late in the 19th century, but this was a short-lived use and the area soon became an open space used for sports. Between 1892 and 1904, the site served as the ground of Hertha BSC.
