1999–2000 Celta de Vigo season
RC Celta de Vigo contested La Liga, the UEFA Cup and Copa del Rey in the 1999-2000 season. Being title contenders up until Christmas, Celta lost their form in the second half of the season, aside from a 4-0 victory against Juventus in the last 16 of the UEFA Cup. The end result was 7th and quarter finals of the UEFA Cup, which meant the side missed out on Champions League football once again. The club also missed the chance to become the first Spanish championship-winning team from Galicia, with arch rivals Deportivo La Coruña winning La Liga.
