Varrio Nuevo Estrada
Varrio Nuevo Estrada, also known as VNEx3, is a Chicano criminal street gang founded in Boyle Heights, California, in the Estrada Courts housing projects. VNE is one of 34 gangs in a 15-square-mile area east of downtown Los Angeles. History Varrio Nuevo Estrada formed in the housing project community of Estrada Courts in Boyle Heights after the government relocated many poor families into the area in the early 1940s. Today VNE is still one of the most prominent Hispanic gangs in eastside of Los Angeles. Location Varrio Nuevo Estrada has expanded to other local cities such as East Los Angeles, Montebello, and Lancaster. VNE cliques include the Tiny Winos, Tiny Locos, Devils, Ninos, Chicos, Cutdowns, Dukes, Tiny Dukes, Tiny Gangsters, Termites, Santos, Spantos, and Malos in Estrada Courts, Tick Tocks, and Tiny Locos in Montebello, and Primos in Lancaster and Rosamond. They are primarily a Los Angeles County gang and there is no validated evidence of subgroups outside of Southern California. Culture Varrio Nuevo Estrada places great admiration on those that have died in the Varrio. One well known example of this is the mural in memory of one such VNE member located at 3328 Hunter Street in Boyle Heights.
