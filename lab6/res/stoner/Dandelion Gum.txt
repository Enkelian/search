Dandelion Gum
Dandelion Gum is the third studio album by Pennsylvania based experimental band Black Moth Super Rainbow, released on CD on May 22, 2007. A 2xLP edition was released on March 15, 2008; the first 1000 copies sold included double gatefold packaging, pink vinyl with gold splashes, and a bubblegum scratch-and-sniff cover, the first 500 of which were hand-numbered. In March, 2011 a deluxe re-issue with 14 "extra flavor" tracks was announced. Background In 2006, an EP called Lost, Picking Flowers in the Woods was released containing the song of the same name, as well as other songs that later appeared on Dandelion Gum. "Sun Lips" is the first track by Black Moth Super Rainbow to be accompanied by an official music video. In mid-2008, it was announced (via an update to the band's official website) that Tobacco would be releasing an album called Super Gum (Destroying Dandelion Gum), rumored to be a remix album. The cover for this album is a crop from a Garbage Pail Kids trading card, Stinker Belle, as found by Tom (aka Rokto) via tumblr.
