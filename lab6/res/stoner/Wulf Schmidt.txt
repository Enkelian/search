Wulf Schmidt
Wulf Dietrich Christian Schmidt, later known as Harry Williamson (7 December 1911 â€“ 19 October 1992) was a Danish citizen who became a double agent working for Britain against Nazi Germany during the Second World War under the codename Tate. He was part of the Double Cross System, under which all German agents in Britain were controlled by MI5 and used to deceive Germany. Nigel West singled him out as "one of the seven spies who changed the world." Career as a double agent Schmidt was sent to Britain by the Abwehr in September 1940, landing by parachute. He was arrested immediately, as a captured agent had divulged the time of his arrival in return for a promise that Schmidt, a friend, would not be executed. Schmidt broke down under interrogation and became a double agent, making contact with Germany by radio in October 1940. He was one of the longest running agents in the Double Cross System; his last contact with Germany was on 2 May 1945. He operated his radio himself until he became ill and had to be imitated by a British operator. Although he recovered from his illness, he was not allowed to operate the radio
