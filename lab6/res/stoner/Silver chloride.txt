Silver chloride
Silver chloride is a chemical compound with the chemical formula AgCl. This white crystalline solid is well known for its low solubility in water (this behavior being reminiscent of the chlorides of Tl+ and Pb2+). Upon illumination or heating, silver chloride converts to silver (and chlorine), which is signaled by grey to black or purplish coloration to some samples. AgCl occurs naturally as a mineral chlorargyrite. Preparation Silver chloride is easily synthesized by combining aqueous solutions of silver nitrate and sodium chloride. AgNO 3 + NaCl ⟶ AgCl ↓ + NaNO 3 {\displaystyle {\ce {AgNO3 + NaCl -> AgCl(v) + NaNO3}}} It can also be produced by reacting silver nitrate with cobalt(II) chloride. This precipitation is general for silver nitrate's reaction with soluble chloride salts and is not unique simply to cobalt. 2 AgNO 3 + CoCl 2 ⟶ 2 AgCl ↓ + Co ( NO 3 ) 2 {\displaystyle {\ce {2 AgNO3 + CoCl2 -> 2 AgCl(v) + Co(NO3)2}}} Structure and reactions The solid adopts the fcc NaCl structure, in which each Ag+ ion is surrounded by an octahedron of six chloride ligands. AgF and AgBr crystallize similarly. However, the crystallography depends on the condition of crystallization, primarily free
