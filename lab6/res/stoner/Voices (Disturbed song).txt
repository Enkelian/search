Voices (Disturbed song)
"Voices" is a song by American heavy metal band Disturbed. The song was released in November 2000 as the third single from their debut album, The Sickness. The song charted at number 16 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks and number 18 on the Modern Rock Tracks. The song has been announced for sale on the Rock Band music store. Music video The music video of the song depicts a businessman who listens to his Walkman constantly. Throughout the video, he imagines various scenarios involving hostile behavior. As David Draiman speaks the song's bridge to the man, he leaves his office and goes to a concert where Disturbed is performing the song. Also, throughout the video, the band is performing at the concert, as well as the band members performing in different parts of the man's office. The office scenes give nods to The Matrix, hence the Matrix code screensaver on the businessman's computer and the overall look of the office room itself. The song, "Stupify" can be heard as the man walks to the elevator early in the video. Live performances Since its inception into Disturbed's concert setlist, the song has remained something of a staple of their live performances
