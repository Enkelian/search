In March 2019 Eddie Jobson was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Roxy Music. Early years Jobson was born Edwin Jobson in Billingham, Stockton-on-Tees, England on 28 April 1955. He started to learn piano at age 7, and added violin when he was 8 - he received a Diploma of Distinction from the Royal Academy of Music at the same age, and was playing in an orchestra at 12. At 16 he applied to study at the Royal Academy, but this was denied a place because of his age, so he joined local band, Fat Grapple, instead. When he was 17 in 1972, Fat Grapple supported Curved Air, and shortly afterwards Jobson replaced the departing Darryl Way on violin.The
