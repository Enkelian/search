Once Bitten (Great White album)
Once Bitten is the third studio album released by the American hard rock band Great White. It was released in 1987 and became a commercial success, selling more than one million copies and being certified Platinum in April, 1988. The anthem "Rock Me" became a hit single, charting in September 1987, and is one of Great White's best known songs. AllMusic explains in their review that it brought Great White a broader audience. "Save Your Love" also charted, becoming their most famous power ballad at the time, in February 1988. "Lady Red Light" and "All Over Now" would become fan favorites and be included among 15 tracks on their later retrospective, "Absolute Hits". The last album to feature bassist Lorne Black. In the UK, the track listing was strangely altered, losing four new tracks and replacing them with songs from 1986 album Shot in the Dark and with a live version of "What Do You Do". The album's opening track, "Lady Red Light", was featured on the NBC show Parks and Recreation in the episode "Tom's Divorce". The model photographed on the cover is Tracy Martinson.
