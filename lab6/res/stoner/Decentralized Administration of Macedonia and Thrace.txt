Decentralized Administration of Macedonia and Thrace
The Decentralized Administration of Macedonia and Thrace (Greek: Αποκεντρωμένη Διοίκηση Μακεδονίας–Θράκης) is one of the seven decentralized administrations of Greece, consisting of the peripheries of Central Macedonia and Eastern Macedonia and Thrace. Seated in Thessaloniki, Central Macedonia. Formation and tasks Decentralized Administrations were created in January 2011 as part of a far-reaching reform of the country's administrative structure, the Kallikratis reform (Law 3852/2010).They enjoy both administrative and financial autonomy and exercise devolved state powers in urban planning, environmental and energy policy, forestry, migration and citizenship. Beyond that, they are tasked with supervising the first and second-level self-governing bodies: the municipalities and regions, in this case the 60 municipalities of Central Macedonia and of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace, and the two regions themselves. Characteristics Covering an area of 32,968 km2 (12,729 sq mi) Macedonia and Thrace is the largest of the seven decentralized administrations by area, and with an overall population of 2,490,290 it is also the second most populated one, following the Decentralized Administration of Attica. In the revised European NUTS nomenclature, the two regions of Macedonia and Thrace together with the two regions of the Decentralized Administration of Epirus and Western Macedonia form the first level NUTS region EL5
