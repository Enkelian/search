Almost a Dance
Almost a Dance is the second studio album by the Dutch doom metal band The Gathering, released in 1993 on Foundation 2000 Records. Tom Holkenberg, one of the producers, will later become better known as the electronic musician Junkie XL. On this album, The Gathering left death growls and their death-doom influences aside, in favor to a more straightforward doom metal sound with clean vocals.
