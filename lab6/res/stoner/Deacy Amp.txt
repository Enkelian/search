Deacy Amp
The Deacy Amp (pronounced "Deeky") is an electric guitar amplifier created in 1972 by Queen's bass guitarist John Deacon, who was an electronic engineer by training. Using the amplifier circuit board from a Supersonic PR80 portable radio found in a skip, it was fitted into a speaker cabinet and powered by a 9-volt battery. The amplifier had no volume or tone controls and for most of its history it was never broken thus never repaired. It was used along with Brian May's Red Special electric guitar and treble-booster to produce sounds reminiscent of various orchestral instruments, such as violin, cello, trombone, clarinet, or even vocals, starting from the songs "Mad The Swine" an unreleased song from the 1973 album Queen and "Procession" from the 1974 album Queen II.

These amps produced a similar compressed and saturated sound but lacked the tonal characteristics that were so crucial to the unique Deacy sound. In 2003, Nigel Knight became involved in the amp's development. Several prototype amps were built
