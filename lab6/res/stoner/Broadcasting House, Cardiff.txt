Broadcasting House, Cardiff
Broadcasting House is the headquarters for BBC Cymru Wales' radio, television and online services, situated in north Cardiff. The purpose-built facility opened in 1966 and consists of three blocks containing studios, offices and technical facilities. The building houses the national broadcaster for Wales, providing a range of English and Welsh language content for audiences across Wales on television, radio and online. History Broadcasting House was designed by Welsh architect Dale Owen (1924â€“97). The BBC moved into the building in 1966, which houses production and technical facilities, and has been the principal base for BBC Cymru Wales since then. It was officially opened by Princess Margaret on St David's Day (1 March) 1967. The building is located in the Llandaff area of northern Cardiff, near the River Taff. It is close to Danescourt railway station and served by several Cardiff Bus services. The BBC National Orchestra of Wales (BBC NOW) and the BBC National Chorus of Wales moved out of Studio 1 at Broadcasting House into a new facility, BBC Hoddinott Hall at the Wales Millennium Centre in 2009. Much of the BBC television drama studio facilities moved out in 2011 to a new facility in Roath Lock, Cardiff Bay. In
