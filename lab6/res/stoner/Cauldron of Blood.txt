Cauldron of Blood
Cauldron of Blood (also known as Blind Man's Bluff) is a 1971 horror film filmed in Spain and directed by Edward Mann. It stars Boris Karloff and Viveca Lindfors. The original Spanish release title was El Coleccionista de cad√°veres (The Corpse Collector).The film was made in 1967, but released after the death of star Karloff in 1971. Karloff plays a blind sculptor, Charles Badulescu, who uses the bones of real people in the creation of his art. United Commonwealth/NTA Television purchased US distribution and TV rights from Cannon Films after the U.S. theatrical run. It was released on VHS and region 0 DVD in the United Kingdom and included the episode The Silver Curtain from Karloff's 1954 TV series Colonel March of Scotland Yard. In 2012, Olive Films gave Cauldron of Blood its first-ever U.S. home video release on DVD and Blu-Ray. Olive's release utilized a surviving print from Cannon Films' owner MGM, and produced under licence from U.S. rights holder Paramount (who obtained those rights from the purchase of Republic Pictures/Spelling Entertainment, which also included the Commonwealth/NTA library).
