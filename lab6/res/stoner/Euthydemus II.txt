Euthydemus II
Euthydemus II (Greek: Εὐθύδημος Β΄) was Graeco-Bactrian king; the son of Demetrius I of Bactria, he became king in the 180s BCE, either after his father's death or as a sub-king to him. The style and rare nickel alloys of his coins associates him closely in time with the king Agathocles but their precise relation remains uncertain. Euthydemus is pictured as a boy on his coins and most likely died very young. He was the last Euthydemid ruler of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom.
