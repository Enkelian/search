Administrative Law Review
The Administrative Law Review was established in 1948 and is the official law journal of the American Bar Association Section of Administrative Law & Regulatory Practice. Overview The journal is a quarterly publication that is managed and edited by approximately 80 students at the Washington College of Law. The 2018â€“2019 Editor-in-Chief is Caroline Raschbaum. The journal has been cited by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (which is known as the administrative law circuit), and since 2000 has been cited by the Second, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuit Courts of Appeal. It was also cited by the Supreme Court of the United States. Admissions The Administrative Law Review selects staff members based on a competitive exercise that tests candidates on their editing skills, research skills, legal analysis skills, and legal writing ability. There is not a preset number of accepted candidates each year; recent classes of new editors have ranged from about 45 to 50. The candidate "write-on" exercise is distributed to candidates during their second semester at the law school. An optional "grade-on" process allows students to become staff members based solely on their grades. Transfer students are also eligible for admission
