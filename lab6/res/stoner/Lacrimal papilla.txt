Lacrimal papilla
The lacrimal papilla is the small rise in the bottom eyelid just before it ends at the corner of the eye closest to the nose. In the middle of it is the lacrimal punctum, a small hole that lets tears drain into the inside of the nose through the lacrimal canaliculi. In medical terms, the lacrimal papilla is a small conical elevation on the margin of each eyelid at the basal angles of the lacrimal lake. Its apex is pierced by a small orifice, the lacrimal punctum, the commencement of the lacrimal canaliculi.
