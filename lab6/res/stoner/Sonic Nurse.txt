Sonic Nurse
Sonic Nurse is the thirteenth studio album by American rock band Sonic Youth, released on June 8, 2004 by Geffen Records. Content The album's cover art was designed by artist Richard Prince from his Nurse Paintings series. Furthermore, one of Prince's photographic creations in this series was titled "Dude Ranch Nurse", which is also the name of a song on this record. "Pattern Recognition" was based on the 2003 William Gibson novel of the same name. Sonic Youth had used Gibson's work as an influence before, notably on a few tracks from Daydream Nation (1988).

Reception The album has a score of 77 out of 100 from Metacritic based on "generally favorable reviews".

Drowned in Sound gave it 5 out of 5 stars and said the album was "the closest to creating a landmark on parallel with ‘Daydream Nation’ they’ve come
