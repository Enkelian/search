Nicomedes III of Bithynia
Nicomedes III Euergetes (the Benefactor, Greek: Νικομήδης Εὐεργέτης, translit. Nikomḗdēs Euergétēs) was the king of Bithynia, from c. 127 BC to c. 94 BC. He was the son and successor of Nicomedes II of Bithynia by an unnamed woman. Life Memnon of Heraclea wrote that Nicomedes III had a son, who succeeded him as Nicomedes IV, with his wife Nysa. According to Granius Licinianus, Nicomedes III had a first wife called Aristonica and had Nicomedes with her. Aristonica died after nine days and he married Nysa, the daughter of Ariarathes VI of Cappadocia and, Laodice of Cappadocia, the sister of Mithridates V of Pontus. Both Nicomedes III and Nysa shared a lineage from the Seleucid dynasty of the Seleucid Empire. Nicomedes also had another son, Socrates Chrestus, from a concubine called Hagne who was from Cyzicus. He sent Socrates and Hagne to Cyzicus with 500 talents. He also had a daughter called Nysa. His second or third wife (depending on which accounts one decides to follow) was Laodice of Cappadocia, his former mother-in-law. Nicomedes and Mithridates VI of Pontus made an alliance.
