Sunset Sound
Sunset Sound Recorders is a recording studio in Hollywood, California, United States located at 6650 Sunset Boulevard. The Sunset Sound Recorders complex was created by Walt Disney's Director of Recording, Tutti Camarata, from a collection of old commercial and residential buildings. At the encouragement of Disney himself, Camarata began the project in 1958, starting with a former automotive repair garage whose sloping floor would tend to reduce unwanted sonic standing wave reflections. Soon, the audio for many of Disney's early films was being recorded at the studio, including Bedknobs and Broomsticks, Mary Poppins, and 101 Dalmatians.Over 200 Gold records have been recorded at Sunset Sound, including Prince's Purple Rain, the Rolling Stones' Exile on Main St., the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds, Linda Ronstadt's Don't Cry Now, part of Guns N' Roses' Chinese Democracy, Janis Joplin's posthumously-released Pearl, and hit albums for Elton John, Led Zeppelin and Van Halen. In addition, The Doors recorded their first two albums, The Doors and Strange Days, at the studio. In 1981, Sunset Sound Recorders owner Camarata purchased The Sound Factory, another Los Angeles recording studio founded by Moonglow Records and later purchased and developed by David Hassinger. The two studios now operate as Sunset
