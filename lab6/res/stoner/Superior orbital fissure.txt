Superior orbital fissure
The superior orbital fissure is a foramen in the skull, although strictly it is more of a cleft, lying between the lesser and greater wings of the sphenoid bone. Structures passing through A number of important anatomical structures pass through the fissure, and these can be damaged in orbital trauma, particularly blowout fractures through the floor of the orbit into the maxillary sinus. These structures are: superior and inferior divisions of oculomotor nerve (III) trochlear nerve (IV) lacrimal, frontal and nasociliary branches of ophthalmic (V1). abducens nerve (VI) superior and inferior divisions of ophthalmic vein. Inferior division also passes through the inferior orbital fissure. sympathetic fibers from cavernous plexusThese include nonvisual sensory messages, such as pain, or motor nerves. They also serve as vascular connections. The nerves passing through the fissure can be remembered with the mnemonic, "Live Frankly To See Absolutely No Insult" - for Lacrimal and Frontal divisions of the ophthalmic nerve (V1), Trochlear nerve (IV), Superior division of the oculomotor nerve (III), Abducens nerve (VI), Nasociliary branch of the ophthalmic nerve (V1) and Inferior Division of the oculomotor nerve (III).It is divided into 3 parts from lateral to medial: Lateral part transmits: superior ophthalmic vein, lacrimal nerve,
