The Winery Dogs
The Winery Dogs are an American rock supergroup formed in New York City, New York, United States, in 2012 by Mike Portnoy, Billy Sheehan and Richie Kotzen. Background The idea of the band started out as a project featuring drummer Mike Portnoy and bassist Billy Sheehan, who were aiming to form a power trio rock band with a lead singer/guitarist as the frontman. After an aborted project, tentatively titled Bad Apple, with guitarist/vocalist John Sykes, talk show host Eddie Trunk heard about it and suggested Richie Kotzen, who has previously played with Sheehan in the band Mr. Big from 1997-2002, to take the spot. The three musicians got together at a studio in Los Angeles and at the end of the jam session, they had a few skeletons of songs that would appear on the debut album. After their first album success, they released a live concert DVD called "Unleashed in Japan 2013: The Winery Dogs." Prior to the Winery Dogs, all three members have had successful careers with other bands. Richie Kotzen is known as former member of bands Poison and Mr. Big, as well as having a consistent solo career with many albums released. Billy Sheehan is known
