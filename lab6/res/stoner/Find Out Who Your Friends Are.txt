Find Out Who Your Friends Are
"Find Out Who Your Friends Are" is a song written by Casey Beathard and Ed Hill, and recorded by American country music artist Tracy Lawrence. It was the lead-off single for his album For the Love, which was released in early 2007 on Rocky Comfort Records, a label which Lawrence owns. The song was originally released to radio stations on August 21, 2006, ahead of its album release on January 30, 2007. The single did not enter the Top 40 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart until January 2007. After the release of For the Love, radio stations began to play an alternate version of the song which featured guest vocals from Tim McGraw and Kenny Chesney, thus helping to boost the song to Number One on both the Billboard and Mediabase country singles charts. Upon reaching Number One in June 2007, "Find Out Who Your Friends Are" set a new record for the slowest-climbing Number One single in the history of the Billboard country music chart, as well as the second-slowest climbing on any Billboard singles chart. In addition, it became Lawrence's first Billboard Number One since 1996's "Time Marches On", ten years earlier. Content "Find Out Who
