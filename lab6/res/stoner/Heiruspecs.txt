Heiruspecs (pronounced high-roo-spex) is a live hip hop band based in the Midway neighborhood of Saint Paul, Minnesota.

The band's first releases Live from the Studio, and Antidisestablishmetabolism are out-of-print, though a compilation featuring songs from them was released as 10 Years Strong in December 2007. Their self-titled album "Heiruspecs," was released on December 13, 2008. On April 22, 2014 the band released "Night Falls."In contrast to many contemporary hip hop groups that use sampling and turntables, Heiruspecs emphasize a raw, live sound celebrating their roots, and local music scene, and are more known for their live performances than records.
