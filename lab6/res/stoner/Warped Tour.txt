Warped Tour
The Vans Warped Tour was a traveling rock tour that toured the United States (including three or four stops in Canada) annually each summer since 1995. It was the largest traveling music festival in the United States, and is the longest-running touring music festival in North America. The first Warped Tour took place in 1995, and the skateboard shoe manufacturer Vans became the main sponsor of the tour starting with the second tour in 1996, when it became known as "The Vans Warped Tour". Although Vans continued to be the main sponsor and lent its name to the festival, other sponsors also participated with stages or other aspects of the festival sometimes being named after them.

Although it has continued to be known primarily as a punk rock festival, it has included acts of diverse genres over the years.Warped Tour founder Kevin Lyman stated that the 2018 Vans Warped Tour would be the final, full cross-country run. On December 18, 2018, Lyman revealed details for the tour's 25th anniversary, with only three events taking place in 2019. Overview The
