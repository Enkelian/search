2020 Summer Olympics
The 2020 Summer Olympics (Japanese: 2020年夏季オリンピック, Hepburn: Nisen Nijū-nen Kaki Orinpikku), officially the Games of the XXXII Olympiad and commonly known as Tokyo 2020 (tōkyō ni-zero-ni-zero), is an upcoming international multi-sport event to be held in Tokyo, Japan. Originally scheduled to take place between 24 July and 9 August 2020, the Games have been rescheduled for 23 July to 8 August 2021 as a result of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic. Despite being held in 2021, the Games of the XXXII Olympiad will keep the name Tokyo 2020 for marketing and branding purposes. This marks the first time ever that the Olympic Games have been postponed, rather than cancelled.Tokyo was selected as the host city during the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 7 September 2013. This will be the second time that Japan—and specifically Tokyo—has hosted the Summer Olympic Games, the first being in 1964, making it the first city in Asia to host the summer Games twice. Overall, these will be the fourth Olympic Games to be held in Japan, which also hosted the Winter Olympics in 1972 (Sapporo) and 1998 (Nagano). The 2020 Games will be the second of three consecutive Olympics to be held in
