I-LIMB Hand
The i-LIMB Hand is the brand name of world's first commercially available bionic hand invented by David Gow and his team at the Bioengineering Centre of the Princess Margaret Rose Hospital in Edinburgh, and manufactured by Touch Bionics. The articulating prosthetic hand has individually powered digits and thumb and has a choice of grips. The i-Limb Hand offers full hand solutions in addition to partial hand solutions. It was launched in Vancouver in July 2007. i-LIMB Hand won the Limbless Association's Prosthetic Product Innovation Award for 2008, was listed at number fourteen in the TIME's list of the Top 50 Best Inventions of 2008, and Touch EMAS/Touch Bionics was awarded The Queen's Award for Enterprise: Innovation (Technology) (2010) for the i-LIMB Hand. How It Works The i-LIMB Hand is controlled through the use of myoelectric signals, which uses the muscle signals in the patient's residual arm to move the i-LIMB Hand around. Electrodes are placed at two pre-determined muscle sites. The electrodes pick up the muscle signals when the patient contracts his/her muscles. These signals are then sent to a microprocessor which causes the device to move. The i-LIMB Hand has up to four different muscle triggers. The user is
