Samson Lulievich Shatashvili (Georgian: სამსონი შათაშვილი, Russian: Самсон Лулиевич Шаташвили) is a theoretical and mathematical physicist who has been working at Trinity College Dublin, Ireland, since 2002. He holds the Trinity College Dublin Chair of Natural Philosophy and is the director of the Hamilton Mathematics Institute.. He is also affiliated with the Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques (IHÉS), where he held the Louis Michel Chair from 2003 to 2013 and currently holds the Israel Gelfand Chair. Prior to moving to Trinity College, he was a professor of physics at Yale University from 1994. Background Shatashvili received his PhD in 1984 at the Steklov Institute of Mathematics in Saint Petersburg under the supervision of Ludwig Faddeev (and Vladimir Korepin). The topic of his thesis was on gauge theories and had the title "Modern Problems in Gauge Theories". In 1989 he received D.S. degree (doctor of science, 2nd degree in Russia) also at the Steklov Institute of Mathematics in Saint Petersburg. Contributions and awards Shatashvili has made several discoveries in the fields of theoretical and mathematical physics. He is mostly known for his work with Ludwig Faddeev on quantum anomalies, with Anton Alekseev on geometric methods in two-dimensional conformal field theories, for
