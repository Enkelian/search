Warehouse district
This is a list of warehouse districts that are notable. A warehouse district or warehouse row is an area found in many urban setting known for being the current or former location of numerous warehouses. Logistically, warehouses are often located in industrial parks, with access to bulk transportation outlets such as highways, railroads, and airports. The areas where warehouses are typically built are often designated as special zones for urban planning purposes, and "can have their own substantial infrastructures, comprising roads, utilities, and energy systems". In many instances, where changing social and economic conditions have made it unfeasible to maintain an existing warehouse district, cities or communities will invest in converting the district to other purposes for which this infrastructure can still be used, such an art district. Such a converted area may continue to be known as a warehouse district. Notable areas known as warehouse districts include: Canada Distillery District is located in Toronto, Ontario and is the largest collection of Victorian-era industrial architecture in North America.
