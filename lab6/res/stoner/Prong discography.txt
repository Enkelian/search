Prong discography

Prong was reformed in early 2002, after a five-year hiatus with a new lineup, tour, and subsequent signed to the Spanish Locomotive Music label to release their first live album, "not-so-creatively titled" 100% Live; followed by 2003's Scorpio Rising. In 2007, the band signed to Al Jourgensen's 13th Planet label, releasing Power of
