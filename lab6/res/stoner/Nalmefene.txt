Nalmefene
Nalmefene (originally known as nalmetrene; trade name Selincro) is an opioid antagonist used primarily in the management of alcohol dependence. It has also been investigated for the treatment of other addictions such as pathological gambling.Nalmefene is an opiate derivative similar in both structure and activity to the opioid antagonist naltrexone. Advantages of nalmefene relative to naltrexone include longer half-life, greater oral bioavailability, and no observed dose-dependent liver toxicity.Like other drugs of this type, nalmefene may precipitate acute withdrawal symptoms in patients who are dependent on opioid drugs, or more rarely when used post-operatively, to counteract the effects of strong opioids used in surgery. Medical uses Opioid overdose Intravenous doses of nalmefene have been shown effective at counteracting the respiratory depression produced by opioid overdose.When nalmefene is used to treat an opioid overdose, doses of nalmefene greater than 1.5 mg do not appear to give any greater benefit than doses of only 1.5 mg. Alcohol dependence Nalmefene is used in Europe to reduce alcohol dependence and NICE recommends the use of nalmefene to reduce alcohol consumption in combination with psychological support for people who drink heavily.Based on a meta analysis, the usefulness of nalmefene for alcohol dependence is unclear.
