Newsroom (BBC programme)
Newsroom was the BBC2 channel's main news programme during the 1960s and early 1970s. The programme began on the day BBC2 started transmission, 20 April 1964 and continued until 1973. The programme was initially broadcast late at night (after 10.30pm) but was moved to a 7.30 - 8.00pm time-slot in 1968. The schedule change was followed by a switch from monochrome to colour transmission; Newsroom was, in fact, the first British news programme to be shown in colour. Until September 1969 it originated from BBC News Studio A at Alexandra Palace, and after this date from Studio N2 at Television Centre. Various newsreaders presented Newsroom over the years, including John Timpson, Peter Woods (from the first night) and Robert Dougall.
