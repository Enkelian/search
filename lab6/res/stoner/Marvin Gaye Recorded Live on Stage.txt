Marvin Gaye Recorded Live on Stage
Marvin Gaye Recorded Live on Stage is the first live album released by singer Marvin Gaye on the Tamla label. Recorded during a Motortown Revue show at Chicago's Regal Theater, the album showcased the musician performing early hits such as "Stubborn Kind of Fellow", "Pride and Joy" and "Hitch Hike" while also adding in unreleased numbers including "One of These Days" (a studio version was released on the b-side of "Pride And Joy" and later as a track on Gaye's 1966 album, Moods of Marvin Gaye), "Mo Jo Hanna" and That Stubborn Kinda Fellow album track, "Get My Hands on Some Lovin'" while also singing three covers - the jazz standard, "Days of Wine and Roses", blues song "Mo Jo Hanna" and his cover of Ray Charles' R&B version of "You Are My Sunshine". Gaye was accompanied throughout the album by Martha and the Vandellas. During these early days and later into his career, Gaye had stage fright and struggled with live performances. Despite this, he performed to enthusiastic audiences, who cheered him on throughout his set. He recorded another live album in the 1960s, the shelved Marvin Gaye at the Copa and finally released another live effort in 1974,
