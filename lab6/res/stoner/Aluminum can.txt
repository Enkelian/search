Aluminum can
An aluminum can (British English: aluminium can), sometimes erroneously referred to as a "tin can", is a single-use container for packaging made primarily of aluminum. It is commonly used for foods and drinks such as beer, baked beans and soup but also for products such as oil, chemicals, and other liquids. Global production is 180 billion annually and constitutes the largest single use of aluminum globally. Usage Use of aluminum in cans began in 1957. Aluminum offers greater malleability, resulting in ease of manufacture; this gave rise to the two-piece can, where all but the top of the can is simply stamped out of a single piece of aluminum, rather than constructed from two pieces of steel. The inside of the can is lined by spray coating an epoxy lacquer or polymer to protect the aluminum from being corroded by acidic contents such as carbonated beverages and imparting a metallic taste to the beverage. The epoxy may contain bisphenol A. A label is either printed directly on the side of the can or will be glued to the outside of the curved surface, indicating its contents. Most aluminum cans are made of two pieces. The bottom and body are "drawn"
