Back-to-Africa
The Back-to-Africa movement, in the 19th century called Black Zionism or the colonization movement', took the view that Americans of African ancestry should return to Africa—not to the homelands of their ancestors, which in most cases were unknown, but to the continent. In general the movement was an overwhelming failure; very few freed slaves wanted to move to Africa, and the small number that did—some under duress—initially faced brutal conditions. As the failure became known in the United States in the 1820s, it spawned and energized the abolitionist movement. Liberia and Sierra Leone became independent black countries after Haïti (January 1st 1804), and became the second and the third of the only three countries founded by former slaves. U.S. Ambassador to Liberia was a coveted position. In the twentieth century Marcus Garvey, Rastafarians, and some other African Americans espoused the concept, but few actually left the United States. Background The question of where free blacks of American birth should reside was not much discussed by white writers in the eighteenth century: "At the time of the American Revolution, there had been few free blacks anywhere in the country." In 1776 slavery was legal in all 13 of the British colonies
