C.A.I. Second S.p.A. was an Italian airline operating flights for its parent company, Alitalia, to preserve slots at Linate Airport. For this reason Alitalia when merged with Air One didn't close C.A.I. at that time known as Volare S.p.A. and then Volareweb.com. It used to be a low cost subsidiary of the old Alitalia-LAI. Its head office was located in Area Tecnica Sud of Terminal 1 of Milan-Malpensa International Airport, in Ferno, Varese, Italy, and it ceased activity with this name on 12 January 2009. The airline was then used to operate Alitalia flights from Linate Airport as C.A.I. Second. This name was only a legal one and not used in public, all of its flights were branded as Alitalia. The airline ceased operations and was merged into Alitalia mainline by February 2015. History Early years At one time the airline (Volare Group) operated flights from Italy to Spain, Germany, France, Belgium, Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Romania and London Luton Airport. The airline suspended its operations in November 2004 and filed for bankruptcy. The tickets on suspended flights were never refunded to passengers. Since then, the airline exited bankruptcy and, for a period, only operated Italian domestic routes. By
