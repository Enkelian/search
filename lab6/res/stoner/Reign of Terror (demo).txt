Reign of Terror (demo)
Reign of Terror was a demo released by Death in 1984. Along with Death's demo Infernal Death, Reign of Terror "influenced the Death metal scene tremendously", as "their low and guttural nature would become the staple of the genre". Author Ian Christe, in his book Sound of the Beast: The Complete Headbanging History of Heavy Metal, noted that Death's demos "became as heavily shared by tape traders as any well-established act in metal". Track listing The fan club version of the demo also features a song titled "Zombie Attack" between "Summoned to Die" and "Witch of Hell".
