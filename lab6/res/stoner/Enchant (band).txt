Enchant (band)
Enchant is an American neo-progressive rock band, formed in 1989. Their music is characterized by ambitious lyrics and melodies along with harmonic experimentation. History Enchant's origins reach back to the end of the 1980s when the band was known as Mae Dae. In 1993 they went into the studio to record "A Blueprint of the World". This was produced by Paul A Schmidt. The band unhappy with the production called on Steve Rothery of Marillion to help co-produce the record with Douglas Ott and Paul Craddick. Rothery added some guitars and remixed some songs. A small German label, Dream Circle, had secured the rights for this album. The band toured Europe in 1993, and the album was later re-released with an extended booklet and a second disc with demos from their first album. Wounded (1996) helped them attract new fans. Time Lost (1997) was released for a tour with Dream Theater. It had four new tracks and previously unreleased material. Break (1998) was promoted live on stage with Spock's Beard and later with Marillion. These albums marked a departure from their first album.Juggling 9 or Dropping 10 was released in 2000. Two band members left after the album was finished.
