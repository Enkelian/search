1788 United States Senate elections in Delaware
The United States Senate elections of 1788 and 1789 were the first elections for the United States Senate, which coincided with the election of President George Washington. As of this election, formal organized political parties had yet to form in the United States, but two political factions were present: The coalition of senators who supported George Washington's administration were known as "Pro-Administration", and the senators against him as "Anti-Administration". As these elections were prior to the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, senators were chosen by State legislatures. Resulting composition Note: There were no political parties in this Congress. Members are informally grouped into factions of similar interest, based on an analysis of their voting record. Beginning of the 1st Congress New York failed to elect its senators until after the Congress began, so its seats are labelled here as "Vacant." North Carolina and Rhode Island did not ratify the Constitution until after the Congress began, so their seats are not included here.
