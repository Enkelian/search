Live from New Jersey
Live from New Jersey is a live album released by Pete Yorn in 2004. It was recorded in Fall 2003 and actually had been available through Yorn's website since January of that year, but now has an "official" release. This release gives a full concert performance of Yorn, who mixes up tracks from both studio albums he had recorded up until that point. While the emphasis is on his debut album, musicforthemorningafter (10 of its 14 tracks are featured here, including "Strange Condition," "On Your Side," "Black" and "Life on a Chain"), there are seven tracks from Day I Forgot. The remainder tracks are covers and one new song.
