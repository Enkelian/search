Christ and the Pale Queens Mighty in Sorrow
Christ And The Pale Queens Mighty In Sorrow is an album by the English group Current 93. Like Imperium it was made during a musical style shift between the earlier industrial sound of Current 93 and the current more neofolk inspired. It was originally released as an LP in 1988 on the Maldoror label, but was reissued as CD in 1989 and 1994.
