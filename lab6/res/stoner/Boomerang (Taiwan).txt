Boomerang (Taiwan)
Boomerang is an American cable television network and streaming service owned by Warner Bros. Entertainment, a subsidiary of AT&T's WarnerMedia. Boomerang originated as a programming block on Cartoon Network introduced in 1992, focusing on classic cartoons from the WB library (including Warner Bros. Cartoons and Hanna-Barbera productions, among others), and eventually grew into its own separate channel devoted to such content in 2000. Since a rebranding in 2015 (which aimed to promote Boomerang as a "second flagship" brand alongside Cartoon Network), Boomerang began to originate original programming, focusing primarily on reboots of popular legacy franchises such as Looney Tunes and Scooby-Doo. The network's drift towards modern content has also seen it carry reruns of current or recent Cartoon Network series. In 2017, Boomerang launched a co-branded over-the-top subscription service focusing on classic cartoons. As of September 2018, Boomerang is available to approximately 38.312 million pay television households in the United States. History Much of the programming that made up the core of Boomerang's lineup was originally part of TBS's Disaster Area, a block of children's programming that aired on that network from 1997 to 1999. Boomerang originated as a programming block on Cartoon Network that debuted on December 8, 1992.
