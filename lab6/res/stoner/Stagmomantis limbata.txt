Stagmomantis limbata
Stagmomantis limbata, common name bordered mantis, bosque mantis, Arizona mantis, or New Mexico praying mantis is a species of praying mantis native to North America, most prevalent in the Southwestern United States. This beneficial insect is green or beige in color and grows up to around 3 inches long. Behavior Stagmomantis limbata are attracted to lights, and males often fly to lights in numbers, but females are unable to fly. Description S. limbata is one of the largest mantids native to North America, though it is much smaller than some African and Asian mantids such as species in the genera Sphodromantis and Hierodula. The facial plate (below and between antennae) is about twice as wide as it is long, typical of the genus, though the eyes are not as protruding as the Carolina Mantid's. Females are most often fairly plain green (often with a yellowish abdomen), but sometimes gray, or light brown, with dark spot in middle of the tegmina, which do not completely cover the wide abdomen. Hind wings may be checkered or striped yellow. Males are slender, long-winged, and variable in color, but most often green and brown with the sides of the folded tegmina green and top
