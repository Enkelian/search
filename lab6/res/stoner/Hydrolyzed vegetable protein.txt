Hydrolyzed vegetable protein
Hydrolyzed vegetable protein (HVP) products are foodstuffs obtained by protein hydrolysis and are used as ingredients with an authentic bouillon (broth) taste. Regarding the production process, a distinction can be made between acid-hydrolyzed vegetable protein (aHVP), enzymatically produced HVP, and other seasonings, e.g., fermented soy sauce. Hydrolyzed vegetable protein products are particularly used to round off the taste of soups, sauces, meat products, snacks, and other dishes, as well as for the production of ready-to-cook soups and bouillons. History Food technologists have long known that protein hydrolysis produces a meat bouillon-like odor and taste. In 1831, Berzelius obtained products having a meat bouillon taste when hydrolysing proteins with hydrochloric acid.Fischer concluded amino acids contributed to the specific taste. In 1954, Philipps found that the bouillon odor required the presence of proteins containing threonine. Another important substance giving a characteristic taste is glutamic acid. Julius Maggi produced acid-catalyzed hydrolyzed vegetable protein industrially for the first time in 1886. Technological background Almost all products rich in protein are suitable for the production of HVP. Today, it is made mainly from protein resources of vegetable origin, such as maize meal, soybean meal, or wheat gluten.Proteins consist of chains of amino acids joined together
