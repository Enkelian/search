In mathematics The number 13 is: the sixth prime number. the smallest emirp (a prime that is a different prime when its digits are reversed). one of only three known Wilson primes. a Fibonacci number. a happy number. the third centered square number. a lucky number. equal to the sum of the squares of the digits of its own square in bases 4 and 83. the smallest number whose fourth power can be written as a sum of two consecutive square numbers (1192 + 1202).Since 52 + 122 = 132, (5, 12, 13) forms a Pythagorean triple.
