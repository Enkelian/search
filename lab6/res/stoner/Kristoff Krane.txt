== About == Kristoff Krane is a rapper from Minneapolis, MN known for his stream-of-consciousness approach to writing, freestyling, and performing.

His newest project, Kairos, is a two-part album with music by Graham O'Brien released via indie record label, F I X."A journey through something both recklessly spontaneous but wholly balanced...with its depth and thought-provoking messages strewn about with quick free writes and playful parables to bridge […] a must for the indie set and conscious hoppers". - URB Magazine "...what might be the greatest treasure is the man’s impressive exhibition of flow, his various speeds and cadences, and voice stretching. Technically, he’s challenged his vocal abilities more so here than ever before, as his fluid and seamless yet excitingly articulated delivery is put to exquisite use, in a variety of modes.” - Swurv "...The whole project feels like it was created in a purgatorial state between our world & some higher dimension. Some of the purest art rap out there .” -Amoeba Music Discography Studio albums This Will Work for Now (2008) Hunting for Father (2010)
