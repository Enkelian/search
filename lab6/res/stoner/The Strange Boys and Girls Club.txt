The Strange Boys and Girls Club
The Strange Boys and Girls Club is the first album by the band The Strange Boys. It was released by In the Red Records on 2 March 2009 in the UK and a day later in the USA. The album was initially recorded with labelmate Jay Reatard. However, the band was unhappy with the takes recorded in the sessions with Reatard and subsequently rerecorded the album with Orville Neeley. Ryan Sambol has said that this was because the recording sessions with Reatard took place at a time when the songs were still "new", and that he "hadn't really finished them". Dusted magazine reported that the recordings with Neeley were made in a disused liquor store. However, this was later denied by Sambol in an interview with Paste magazine. He clarified that this had been the case with an earlier release, recorded with Greg Ashley, not The Strange Boys and Girls Club, the recording of which took place in Neeley's garage.The album was released to generally favourable reviews, attaining a score of 76% from the reviews collated by Metacritic.
