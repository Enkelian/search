106 & Park
106 & Park was an American hip hop and R&B music video show, set up in a countdown format, that was broadcast Monday to Friday at 6/5c on BET (7:00 pm on BET International). Since its inception, it had been the network's number-one rated show. On November 14, 2014, BET cancelled 106 & Park. Location The show was originally produced in Harlem, New York City, and the title of the show is derived from the original studio location at East 106th Street and Park Avenue. Viacom's acquisition of BET prompted a change to the CBS Broadcast Center at 524 West 57th Street between 10th & 11th Avenues, in the Hell's Kitchen section of Midtown Manhattan, turning its title into a misnomer for the rest of its history. Hosts AJ & Free (2000–2005) A. J. Calloway and Marie "Free" Wright were the original hosts of the show from September 11, 2000 until July 28, 2005, when Calloway (who was tearful on that episode) announced that it would be his last show, as well as for Free (who spoke via phone), as the show was either presented by Calloway or Wright.
