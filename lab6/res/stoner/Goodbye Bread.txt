Goodbye Bread
Goodbye Bread is the fourth album by San Francisco garage rock singer-songwriter Ty Segall. Pitchfork placed the album at number 31 on its list of the "Top 50 albums of 2011". The album presented a much more melodic, sappy energy relative to Segall's previous rock-oriented releases. Distortion effects such as fuzz and overdrive, though, were still heavily broadcast in songs such as "My Head Explodes" and "Where Your Head Goes". Although only one single was released from the album (for "I Can't Feel It"), it spawned three official music videos for "Goodbye Bread", "Where Your Head Goes" and "You Make the Sun Fry". Track listing Reception The album received mostly positive reviews. Earbuddy's Nick Krenn scored the album a 9.0 out of 10 writing "His songs are undeniably attachable to situations within our own lives and feature no whiny love songs. Life isnâ€™t just about love. We have problems that go beyond relationships whether they involve money or our cynicism. Segall works them out with his guitar and drums and gives us the soundtrack to do the same." == References ==
