The Hair and Skin Trading Company
The Hair and Skin Trading Company is a British drone / avant-noise group, formed in 1991 by ex-Loop members Neil Mackay (vocals/bass) and John Wills (drums). Joined by Nigel Webb (Guitars) and Richard Johnston on samples (who left as a band member during the recording of the first album, but periodically collaborated as a live engineer adding live dub to their sound and whose samples also appear on Psychedelische Musique uncredited), they released their debut album Jo in Nine G Hell on Beggars Banquet Records in 1992. They also played the Reading Festival that year, with tours of Europe, US and the UK, following their subsequent releases - with shows at CBGB's and the Knitting Factory, New York & Festivals such as C.M.J - New York, Roskilde Festival, Denmark and Phoenix Festival, United Kingdom. Their first two albums bear influences of My Bloody Valentine and The Skids, while the vocal delivery has been compared to The Fall's Mark E Smith. By the third album, 1995's Faust-like Psychedelische Musique, the band had dispensed with conventional rock elements, and few of its songs bear titles; they are instead denoted by either letters or symbols. They released their fourth album on 1 September
