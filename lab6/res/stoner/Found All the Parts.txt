Found All the Parts
Found All the Parts is an EP released by Cheap Trick in 1980. It was released on a 10-inch disc as part of Epic Records' short-lived Nu-Disk series. The EP also contained a bonus promotional 7" single of "Everything Works If You Let It". Found All the Parts was re-issued in 12-inch format in 1983. "Day Tripper" was not actually recorded live. While the band had recorded a live cover of the song, they did not like the way it had turned out. It was rerecorded in the studio with the live crowd from the original track added in. "Can't Hold On" was from the Budokan concert in 1978 and has since been included on the Budokan II and Cheap Trick at Budokan: The Complete Concert albums. "Such a Good Girl" and "Take Me I'm Yours" were recorded with producer Jack Douglas between December 1979 and January 1980, not 1976 and 1977 as the album claims. Several other tracks were recorded during the same sessions, most of which are scarce or still remain unreleased (see outtakes below). This EP is currently available as bonus tracks to the 2006 remastered re-issue of the All Shook Up album in every region except
