University of Texas at Dallas
The University of Texas at Dallas (UTD or UT Dallas) is a public research university with its main campus in Richardson, Texas. It is part of the University of Texas System. Approximately one-third of the campus is located within Dallas County, with plans to open an on-campus DART train stop on the Silver Line (2022). The institution, established in 1961 as the Graduate Research Center of the Southwest and later renamed the Southwest Center for Advanced Studies (SCAS), began as a research arm of Texas Instruments. In 1969, the founders bequeathed SCAS to the state of Texas, officially creating The University of Texas at Dallas. The university has been characterized by rapid growth in research output and its competitive undergraduate admissions policies since its inception. Less than 47 years after its founding, the Carnegie Foundation had classified the university as a doctoral research university with "Highest Research Activity"â€”faster than any other school in Texas. The university is associated with four Nobel Prizes, and has members of the National Academy of Science and National Academy of Engineering on its faculty. Research projects include the areas of Space Science, Bioengineering, Cybersecurity, Nanotechnology, and Behavioral and Brain Sciences. The University of Texas at
