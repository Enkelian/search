Yanaguana (San Antonio)
Yanaguana was the Payaya Indian village in the geographical area that became the Bexar County city of San Antonio, in the U.S. state of Texas.

The National Park Service has a designated "Yanaguana Trail" that runs along the river at Mission San Juan Capistrano. In 1933 Frederick C. Chabot of San Antonio formed the Yanaguana Society, specifically named for the Payaya village, to collect and preserve the early artifacts and history of the area. The organization lasted through 1960.The first recorded European contact with the village occurred when Spanish Franciscian priest Dami√°n Massanet led a military expedition through the area.

The priest detailed a great variety of trees, abundant waters and fishing opportunities,
