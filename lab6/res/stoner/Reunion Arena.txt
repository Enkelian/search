Reunion Arena
Reunion Arena was an indoor arena located in the Reunion district of downtown Dallas, Texas. The arena served as the primary home of the National Basketball Association's Dallas Mavericks and the National Hockey League's Dallas Stars. Its capacity held accommodations for 18,190 basketball spectators and 17,000 for ice hockey spectators. Reunion was also a performance venue for some of the biggest names in popular music from the 1980s through the late 2000s including Paul McCartney, Michael Jackson, Prince, Van Halen Frank Sinatra, Elton John, David Bowie, Madonna, Pink Floyd, Queen, U2, R.E.M. and Radiohead. Reunion Arena was demolished in November 2009 and the site was cleared by the end of the year. History Reunion Arena was completed in 1980 at a cost of US $27 million. It was named for the early mid-19th century commune, La Reunion. Reunion Arena was notable for two lasts: it was the last NBA or NHL arena to be built without luxury suites, and it was the last NHL arena to still use an American Sign and Indicator scoreboard (though not the last in the NBAâ€”see Charlotte Coliseum). The color matrix messageboards on that scoreboard were replaced in 1991 with Sony Jumbotron video screens. Home
