Adrenaline (album)
Adrenaline is the debut studio album by American alternative metal band Deftones, released on October 3, 1995 by Maverick Records. The majority of the album was produced by Terry Date, while a hidden track titled "Fist" was produced by Ross Robinson. Recording Regarding the recording, drummer Abe Cunningham said, "At the time we did the first record – which I really like and think is good – you can tell the band was really young. We'd been playing most of those songs for quite a while, and we were just so happy to be making a record that we didn't really think a whole lot about making the songs better". Frontman Chino Moreno felt that Adrenaline was recorded "really fast", and he performed all his vocals live with the band in the room using a hand-held Shure SM58 microphone. Promotion "7 Words" was released as the first single from the album on December 17, 1995. It was followed by "Bored", issued as the second single on April 4, 1996. Music videos were released for "7 Words", "Bored", "Root" and fan favorite "Engine No. 9"; the latter song was also featured in the film Law Abiding Citizen. Reception Adrenaline was praised
