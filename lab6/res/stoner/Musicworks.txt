Musicworks
Musicworks is a Canadian avant-garde music magazine, launched in January 1978 by Andrew Timar (editor-in-chief) and John Oswald (design and production). History The first 4 issues came as a supplement to Only Paper Today, a Toronto art magazine published by Victor Coleman. It was then published quarterly by Toronto's Music Gallery, with funding from the Canada Council, the Ontario Arts Council, private donations and paid advertisement. The journal's offices were located inside The Music Gallery on Saint Patrick Street, Toronto. In 1980, John Oswald summed up the birth of the magazine in an editorial titled The Story of Musicworks:"Four years ago, interested parties at the Music Gallery, an experimental music performance facility in Toronto, and Only Paper Today, an art publication, initiated a magazine of new musics as a supplement to OPT. This was accomplished with volunteered contributions of materials, editorial time, and print space in an existing magazine with existing distribution. The first four Musicworks issues were published in this way." In 1982, composer Tina Pearson, then instructor at the Ontario College of Art and Design, became editor and launched the first companion cassette with issue #23, 1983. Pearson and Timar were both members of contemporary music collective New
