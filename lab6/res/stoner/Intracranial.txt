Intracranial
The cranial cavity, also known as intracranial space, is the space within the skull. The space inside the skull is formed by eight cranial bones known as the neurocranium. The neurocranium is the upper back part that forms the protective case around the brain. The skull cap of the neurocranium covers the cranial cavity and the remainder of the skull is called the facial skeleton. The skull (minus the mandible) is also known as the cranium, and contains the brain. Meninges are protective membranes that surround the brain to minimize damage of the brain when there is head trauma. Meningitis is the inflammation of meninges caused by bacterial or viral infections. Structure The capacity of an adult human cranial cavity is 1,200â€“1,700 cm3.The spaces between meninges and the brain are filled with a clear cerebrospinal fluid, increasing the protection of the brain. Facial bones of the skull are not included in the cranial cavity. There are only eight cranial bones: The occipital, two parietal, the frontal, two temporal, the ethmoid and the sphenoid bones are fused together by the ossification of fixed fibrous sutures. The frontal and sphenoid bones are towards the front middle of the skull and in front
