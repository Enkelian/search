Malignancy (band)
Malignancy is an American technical death metal band from Yonkers, New York formed in February 1992. History Malignancy was formed in February 1992 by vocalist Danny Nelson and guitarist Javier Velez. They released their first demo, Eaten Out from Within, in April 1993. After multiple line-up changes and three more demos the band finally secured a deal with United Guttural Records in 1998. Shortly after, the band released their first album, Intrauterine Cannibalism in early 1999. Soon they released an EP, Motivated By Hunger. In 2001they released a demo compilation CD, Ignorance Is Bliss, released through Primitive Recordings which contains material from Eaten Out from Within, Ignorance Is Bliss, 1998 promo CD and other rehearsal and demo tracks. Cross Species Transmutation was the last EP released on the now defunct label. Originally slated to be a full-length, the band decided to record what they had and Roger J. Beaujard parted ways. Mike Heller was then added to the malignant fold. A year's worth of teaching and practising ensued for the band to prep Mike for live gigs. After the release the band began a two-year-long search for a new label, which ended with them signing to Willowtip Records in 2006
