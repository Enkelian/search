Energy in Greece
Energy production in Greece is dominated by the state owned Public Power Corporation (known mostly by its acronym ΔΕΗ, or in English DEI). In 2009 DEI supplied for 85.6% of all electric energy demand in Greece, while the number fell to 77.3% in 2010. Almost half (48%) of DEI's power output is generated using lignite, a drop from the 51.6% in 2009.12% of Greece's electricity comes from hydroelectric power plants and another 20% from natural gas. Between 2009 and 2010, independent companies' energy production increased by 56%, from 2,709 Gigawatt hour in 2009 to 4,232 GWh in 2010.In line with the European Commission's Directive on Renewable Energy, Greece aims to get 18% of its overall energy from renewable sources by 2020. In 2015, according to the independent power transmission operator in Greece (ΑΔΜΗΕ) more than 20% of the electricity in Greece has been produced from renewable energy sources and hydroelectric powerplants. This percentage in April reached 50%. The same trend was the case also for 2016 .The contribution of RES (non-hydroelectric) to the gross final electricity consumption accounted for 24.5% in 2016, while hydroelectric power represented approximately 25% by installed capacity. According to the Greek Electricity Market Operator (LAGIE), the
