Mountain Studios
Mountain Studios is a multi-track recording studio previously located inside Montreux Casino in Montreux, Switzerland, but now located in Attalens. It was owned by Alex Grob and Anita Kerr until 1979, when they sold it to the rock band Queen. David Richards, a long-time producer for Queen, bought it in 1995. Upon Richards' death in 2013, the location of the former studio became the charity museum/exhibition Queen: The Studio Experience, with the Mercury Phoenix Trust being the beneficiary.
