Hello Broadway
Hello Broadway is the fourth studio album by soul singer Marvin Gaye, released in 1964. It is an album of standards and Broadway material.Released during the middle of Gaye's coming-of-age as Motown's premier male solo star, the album showcases more of Gaye's personal desire to be a Nat King Cole/Frank Sinatra styled crooner rather than the R&B hitmaker Motown was grooming him into. Hello Broadway and Gaye's When I'm Alone I Cry albums were released at a time when Motown executives wanted Gaye to record for strictly the young R&B crowds rather than capture a more mature audience. It would take Gaye years to craft an album of standards that were more of his making, rather than the Cole-styled vocals he laid during this earlier period.
