Squares in London
Squares have long been a feature of London and come in numerous identifiable forms. The landscaping spectrum of squares stretches from those containing more hardscape constituting town squares (also known as city squares) to those containing planted communal gardens, for which London is a major international exponent, known as garden squares. A few in the capital of the United Kingdom such as Trafalgar Square were from the outset public open spaces in exactly the same way as other city squares worldwide, typically a plaza, piazza and a platz in Spain, Italy and Germany.
