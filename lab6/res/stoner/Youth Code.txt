Youth Code
Youth Code is an American EBM duo, formed in 2012 by Sara Taylor and Ryan George in Los Angeles, California. The duo's musical style, following the model of early Wax Trax! Records, has been described as industrial music infused with "hardcore angst." Following their self-released Demonstrational Cassette in 2012 and a chance meeting with Psychic TV, Youth Code were invited to release their first single, "Keep Falling Apart", through Angry Love Productions (the label's first non-Psychic TV release). Since then, they have released two full-length studio albums, an EP, and two additional singles.In 2013, Youth Code signed with Dais Records, releasing their self-titled debut and served as the opening act for groups such as AFI, Suicide Commando, and Nothing. The pair's music has drawn the attention of mainstream media outlets such as the Los Angeles Times and Pitchfork, as well as praise from major industrial acts such as Skinny Puppy and Front Line Assembly, who invited them on the Eye vs. Spy Tour in 2014. Youth Code opened for Skinny Puppy's Down the SocioPath Tour later in 2015 and have since continued to perform throughout the country. They released their second album, Commitment to Complications, in April 2016. History Formation
