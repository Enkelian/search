Sea of Light (album)
Sea of Light is the 19th album by the British rock band Uriah Heep, released in April 1995. Its songs have remained part of the band's live set to this day. Bassist Trevor Bolder sings lead on "Fear of Falling" and delivers four songs for this album, as many as on the predecessor Different World, a count he never reaches before and after. Roger Dean was responsible for the sleeve painting, his third for Uriah Heep.
