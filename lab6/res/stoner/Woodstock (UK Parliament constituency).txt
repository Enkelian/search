Woodstock (UK Parliament constituency)
Woodstock, sometimes called New Woodstock, was a parliamentary constituency in the United Kingdom named after the town of Woodstock in the county of Oxfordshire. History The Parliamentary Borough comprised the town of Woodstock and (from 1832) the surrounding countryside and villages, and elected two Members of Parliament from its re-enfranchisement in 1553 until 1832. Under the Great Reform Act 1832, the representation of the borough was reduced to one member. Under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885, the borough was abolished and was reconstituted as the Mid or Woodstock Division of Oxfordshire when the three-member Parliamentary County of Oxfordshire was divided into the three single-member constituencies of Banbury, Woodstock and Henley. It comprised the middle part of Oxfordshire, including Witney and Bicester as well as the abolished borough. The constituency was abolished under the Representation of the People Act 1918. The western half, including Witney and Woodstock, was added to the Banbury Division and the eastern half, including Bicester, to the Henley Division.
