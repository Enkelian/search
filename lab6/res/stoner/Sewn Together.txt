Sewn Together
Sewn Together is American rock band the Meat Puppets' twelfth full-length studio album, released on May 12, 2009, both on CD and vinyl. It was the follow-up to their 2007 reunion album Rise to Your Knees. Recording and background Background Curt Kirkwood commented in an interview that the album was put together over a short period of time, comparing its production to the group's earlier albums. He said, "In the '80s, we used to just crap this stuff out. Those SST records cost, like, five grand apiece, if that much, and those are the records that made people like us. Now, if I can get away with it, I'll make a record as cheap as I can and put as little work as I can into it, which is what we did with this one. I don't like putting a lot of time into it. We cut a track, and if we've played it halfway right, we're done with it". Recording and production Sewn Together was recorded at drummer Ted Marcus' apartment and at The Saltmine Studios in Mesa, Arizona, United States. Content Musical style Courtney Devores of Charlotte Observer delineated the sound of Sewn Together as "warm, psychedelic folk-rock".
