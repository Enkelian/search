Dielectric constant
The relative permittivity of a material is its (absolute) permittivity expressed as a ratio relative to the vacuum permittivity. Permittivity is a material property that affects the Coulomb force between two point charges in the material. Relative permittivity is the factor by which the electric field between the charges is decreased relative to vacuum. Likewise, relative permittivity is the ratio of the capacitance of a capacitor using that material as a dielectric, compared with a similar capacitor that has vacuum as its dielectric. Relative permittivity is also commonly known as the dielectric constant, a term still used but deprecated by standards organizations in engineering as well as in chemistry. Definition Relative permittivity is typically denoted as εr(ω) (sometimes κ, lowercase kappa) and is defined as ε r ( ω ) = ε ( ω ) ε 0 , {\displaystyle \varepsilon _{r}(\omega )={\frac {\varepsilon (\omega )}{\varepsilon _{0}}},} where ε(ω) is the complex frequency-dependent permittivity of the material, and ε0 is the vacuum permittivity. Relative permittivity is a dimensionless number that is in general complex-valued; its real and imaginary parts are denoted as: ε r ( ω ) = ε r ′ ( ω ) − i ε r ″ ( ω
