Ó Catháin
The Ó Catháin, meaning "descendants of Cahan", were a sept of the Cenél nEógain branch of the Northern Uí Néill in medieval Ireland. The surname is usually Anglicised in Ulster as O'Cahan or O'Kane. They originated in the Laggan district in the east of modern County Donegal in the west of Ulster, and from there moved eastwards in the twelfth century, ousting the Uí Conchobair from Keenaght in modern-day County Londonderry, also in Ulster. They held the lordship of Keenaght and Coleraine until the seventeenth century, to which it was commonly referred to as "O'Cahan's country". Under the sub-ordination of the Ó Néill clan of the Cenél nEógain, they held the privilege of inaugurating the chief of the Ó Néill by tossing a shoe over the new chief's head in acceptance of his rule. There is also an unrelated sept of Uí Catháin in the province of Connacht, the Ó Catháin Uí Fiachrach. At first Ó Catháin held the title chief of cenel Ianna. After expelling Ó Draighneán, chief of Cenel Sedna, Ó Catháin was henceforth known as chief of cenel Sedna. Eogháin Ua Catháin, Abbot of Cluan-fearta-Brennainn (Clonfert,Co. Galway) died 980 A.D. He was the earliest recorded Ó Catháin
