Robinson Barracks
Robinson Barracks is a military base of U.S. in the Burgholzhof community in the northern Stuttgart district of Bad Cannstatt. Unlike Patch Barracks and Kelley Barracks, also located in Stuttgart, the modern Robinson Barracks is now largely a residential neighborhood for US Department of Defense personnel stationed in the greater Stuttgart area operated and administered by IMCOM- Europe. The installation is named after 1st Lt. James E. Robinson, Jr. (1918â€“1945), an Army officer posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor during World War II. History The military use of the site began in 1927 with the construction of a training ground named Flandern for the German Army's 119th Infantry Regiment. In 1934, an adjacent farm was impounded and barracks were constructed which later became the adjacent Grenadier Kaserne (now closed). After World War II the U.S. Army used the installation as a displaced persons camp until 1949 when the installation became an Army post renamed Robinson Barracks. From that time through the end of the Cold War, Robinson Barracks and Grenadier Kaserne operated largely as a housing area, shopping area and logistical support activity for the Stuttgart Military Community- which covered 13 installations over an area the size of Rhode Island
