Dixie Coca-Cola Bottling Company Plant
The Dixie Coca-Cola Bottling Company Plant, also known as Baptist Student Center, Georgia State University or Baptist Student Union, Georgia State University, is a historic building at 125 Edgewood Avenue in Atlanta, Georgia. Built in 1891, it was the headquarters and bottling plant of the Dixie Coca-Cola Bottling Company, and the place where the transition from Coca-Cola as a drink served at a soda fountain to a mass-marketed bottled soft drink took place. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1983, and is one of the only buildings in Atlanta dating to Coca-Cola's early history. Since 1966 the building has been the Baptist Student Union for Georgia State University. Description and history The former Dixie Coca-Cola building is located in downtown Atlanta, at the southeast corner of Edgewood Avenue and Courtland Street. It is a relatively small two-story structure, mostly built out of brick, with a projecting wood-frame clapboarded square turret at the corner. The building is irregularly shaped, due in part to the unusual lot on which it stands. Its Edgewood Avenue facade has three large arched windows on the first floor, and Queen Anne-style variety of shapes defining its roof line at and above the second level.The
