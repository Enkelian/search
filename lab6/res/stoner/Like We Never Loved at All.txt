"Like We Never Loved At All" is a song recorded by American country music singer Faith Hill. It was released in August 2005 as the second from her album Fireflies. The song features her husband Tim McGraw singing harmony vocals. Like two other singles from the album — "Mississippi Girl" and "Sunshine and Summertime" — this song was co-written by John Rich of Big & Rich, Vicky McGehee and Scot Sax.
