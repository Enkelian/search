Slope Records
Slope Records is a Sunnyslope, Arizona based music record label. History Phoenix-based Slope Records was formed in 2015 as an outlet to bring attention to selected bands and music. Initially, just a hobby for the founder, Thomas Lopez aka "Tommy Blank” lead singer for The Blankz, Slope Records quickly evolved into a growing entity in the music business and featured an expanding list of artists creating new music, as well as an array of punk re-issues. “Slope” refers to Sunnyslope, Arizona where the label's home offices are located. Sunnyslope is now part of central Phoenix, but was once the north edge of town. Part of the mission of Slope Records was to bring attention to the burgeoning Phoenix music scene through the re-release of classic Arizona punk rock bands as well as new releases by both Arizona and national acts.Slope Records released Product of America by Exterminators on Election Day 2016, which was, at the time, the biggest release on the label. Exterminators are a Phoenix punk rock super group featuring Dan “Johnny Macho” Clark on vocals (Victory Acres, Feederz), Doug “Buzzy Murder” Clark on guitar (Mighty Sphincter), Don Bolles on drums (Germs, 45 Grave), and Cris Kirkwood (Meat Puppets)
