The Loft (Sirius XM)
The Loft is an online and app-based music channel on Sirius XM Radio which features a format of eclectic adult album alternative music, occasionally branching off into more freeform music and talk programming. Until November 12, 2008, it broadcast an acoustic rock format. The Loft then changed formats to what sounded like the now-defunct SIRIUS Disorder and Fine Tuning stations by that time, with its sister channel, The Coffee House, adopting the acoustic rock format. Mike Marrone was the channel's program director and primary on-air voice until his retirement in December 2017. He was replaced by Chris Muckley, who is heard regularly alongside DJs such as Franny Thomas and Meg Griffin. In 2018, The Loft transitioned to an entirely online XM presence, as its former channel is now used for limited-engagement theme channels focused on specific artists, such as The Eagles and Billy Joel. Current programming Featured programs on the channel include: The Loft Over Easy - laid-back music for a Sunday morning. Disorder - a freeform show hosted Saturday mornings by Meg Griffin. Celtic Crush - an eclectic sampler of Irish sounds hosted by Larry Kirwan. The Loft Sessions - a series of live performances recorded at XM's studio
