Administrative divisions of Transnistria
The Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR, also known as Transnistrian Republic) is subdivided into five raions (Russian names are listed in parentheses): Camenca (Кáменка, Kamenka) Rîbnița (Рыбница, Rybnitsa) Dubăsari (Дубоссáры, Dubossary) Grigoriopol (Григорио́поль, Grigoriopol') Slobozia (Слободзе́я, Slobodzeya)and one municipality: Tiraspol (Тира́споль)Also, Bender (Tighina; Бендéры), situated on the western bank of the Dniester (in Bessarabia), geographically outside Transnistria, is not part of territorial unit Transnistria of Moldova as defined by the central authorities, but is controlled by the PMR authorities, which consider it part of PMR's administrative organization. During the 1992 War of Transnistria some villages in the central part of Transnistria which geographically are situated on the eastern bank of Dniester, rebelled against the new separatist PMR authorities and since then have been under effective Moldovan control. These localities are: commune Cocieri (including village Vasilievca), commune Molovata Nouă (including village Roghi), commune Corjova (including village Mahala), commune Coșnița (including village Pohrebea), commune Pîrîta, and commune Doroțcaia. The village of Corjova is in fact divided between PMR and Moldovan central government areas of control. Roghi is also controlled by the PMR authorities. At the same time, some areas which are situated on the right bank of the Dniester are under PMR control.
