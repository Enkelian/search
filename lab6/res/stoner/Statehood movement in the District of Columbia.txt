Statehood movement in the District of Columbia
The District of Columbia statehood movement is a political movement that advocates making the District of Columbia a U.S. state. The District of Columbia is a federal district under the direct jurisdiction of the United States Congress. Statehood would grant the District voting representation in the Congress and full control over local affairs. For most of the modern statehood movement, the new state's name would have been "New Columbia", although the Washington, D.C. Admission Act of 2019 refers to the proposed state as "Washington, Douglass Commonwealth."Statehood for the District, which is also known as District of Columbia, might be achieved by an act of Congress, under the power granted to Congress by the United States Constitution to admit new states to the Union (Article IV, Section 3, Clause 1). However, there is some debate as to whether simple legislation would be sufficient to grant statehood to District of Columbia, which is the seat of the United States federal government. If the District of Columbia were to become a state – based on 2018 figures – it would rank 49th by population, 51st by area, 1st by GDP per capita, 1st by median household income, and 34th by total GDP.
