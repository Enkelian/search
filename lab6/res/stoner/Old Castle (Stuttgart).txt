Old Castle (Stuttgart)
The Old Castle (German: Altes Schloss) is a former castle located on the Schillerplatz in Stuttgart, Germany. The castle, originally a water castle dating back to the 10th century, was the residence of the Counts and later some Dukes of Württemberg and today is the home of the Landesmuseum Württemberg. The castle church (German: Schloßkirche) still functions as a place of worship. History In the year 950 AD, a castle was completed on the grounds of the Old Castle to protect the mare garden. In the 14th century, it was the home of the Counts of Württemberg and their Court Chamber. From 1553-1578, Dukes Christoph and Louis III renovated the castle adding an equestrian staircase built by Blasius Berwart in 1560 and the church and conference room in 1562. In the 18th century, the moat was filled. In 1931, the castle's dirnitz and two towers were destroyed by fire. The castle again saw damage, large parts of the ethnographic collection of the Landesmuseum Württemberg falling victim to fire, during World War Two before being renovated in 1971. Paul Schmitthenner renovated the castle in 1971. The arcaded courtyard of the castle itself shows architectural motifs of early Italian Renaissance. King Charles
