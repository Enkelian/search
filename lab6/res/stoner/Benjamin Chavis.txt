Dr. Benjamin Franklin Chavis Jr. (born January 22, 1948) is an African-American civil rights leader. In his youth, Chavis was an assistant to Martin Luther King Jr., who inspired him to work in the civil rights movement. At the age of 24, Chavis rose to international prominence in 1971 as the leader of the Wilmington Ten, civil rights activists who were convicted of committing arson. As the oldest of the ten, Chavis received the longest sentence. Their convictions and sentences were appealed, and in 1980 all ten were freed due to "prosecutorial misconduct." Chavis returned to graduate school and the field of civil rights, and he became a Vice President of the National Council of Churches. The board of the NAACP elected Chavis as the Executive Director of America's oldest civil rights organization. Chavis later served as the National Director of the Million Man March, and the Founder and CEO of the National African American Leadership Summit (NAALS). Since 2001, Chavis has been CEO and Co-Chairman of the Hip-Hop Summit Action Network, in New York City which he co-founded with hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons.
