Boogie rock
Boogie rock is a genre of rock music which came out of the hard heavy blues rock of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Largely designed for dance parties, it tends to feature a repetitive driving rhythm in place of instrumental experimentation found in the more progressive blues-rock bands of the period. Boogie rockers concentrate on the groove, working a steady and chugging back beat, often in shuffle time. See also Rockabilly == References ==
