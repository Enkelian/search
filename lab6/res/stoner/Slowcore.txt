Slowcore
Slowcore is a subgenre of alternative rock and indie rock. The music of slowcore artists is generally characterized by bleak lyrics, downbeat melodies, slower tempos and minimalist arrangements. Slowcore is often used interchangeably with the term sadcore. Characteristics Slowcore is a fusion genre of indie rock and sadcore, characterised by minimal musical backing, played at extremely slow speeds. Slowcore songs feature "depressing lyrics", according to Listverse. Some singer-songwriters who have been labelled slowcore include distinctive and unusual vocalists, such as the Swedish singer Stina Nordenstam, and bands with creative drummers, such as Codeine. History Early acts such as Galaxie 500 and American Music Club were hugely influential on the genre; however, they are not generally considered slowcore acts. The genre began in the early 1990s as an act of rebellion against the predominant energy and aggression of grunge. The genre is linked to the band Low, who began experimenting by playing quietly and slowly to traditional rock audiences.Artists associated with the genre include Bluetile Lounge, Duster, Tacoma Radar, Bedhead, early Red House Painters, Spain, Codeine, Pedro the Lion, Idaho, Low, and Rivulets.
