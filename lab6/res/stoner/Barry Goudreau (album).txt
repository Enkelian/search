Barry Goudreau (album)
Barry Goudreau is the debut self-titled album of original Boston guitarist Barry Goudreau. Featuring Goudreau's Boston bandmates Brad Delp on lead vocals and Sib Hashian on drums (as well as future Boston singer Fran Cosmo), the album displays a sound very similar to that of Boston's first two releases, Boston (1976) and Don't Look Back (1978). However, neither this album nor any of Goudreau's subsequent releases with other acts (Orion The Hunter, RTZ) proved to be as commercially successful as his work with Boston. The album was released in 1980 and was Goudreau's only solo album. The song "Dreams" was released as a single in 1980, nearly cracking Billboard's top 100. It still receives airplay today on Classic rock radio stations, as does "Mean Woman Blues".
