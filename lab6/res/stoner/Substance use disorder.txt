Substance use disorder
Substance use disorder (SUD), also known as a drug use disorder, is the persistent use of drugs (including alcohol) despite substantial adverse consequences. Substance use disorders are characterized by an array of mental, physical, and behavioral symptoms that may cause problems related to loss of control, strain to one's interpersonal life, hazardous use, tolerance, and withdrawal. Drug classes that are involved in SUD include: alcohol; caffeine; cannabis; hallucinogens (such as arylcyclohexylamines); other hallucinogens (such as LSD); inhalants; opioids; sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics; stimulants; tobacco; and other or unknown substances.In the DSM-5, substance abuse and substance dependence have been merged into the category of substance use disorders. The severity of substance use disorders can vary widely; in the diagnosis of a SUD, the severity of an individual's SUD is qualified as mild, moderate, or severe on the basis of how many of the 11 diagnostic criteria are met. In the DSM-5, the term drug addiction is synonymous with severe substance use disorder.In 2017 globally 271 million people (5.5% of adults) were estimated to have used one or more illicit drugs.
