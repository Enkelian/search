Warmen
Warmen is a Finnish metal band assembled by keyboard player Janne Viljami Wirman - also known as Warman. Janne has been playing with Children of Bodom since 1997, and in 2000 created a musical project focused on instrumental work, which would only have guest singers on a few selected songs. Albums Unknown Soldier (1999–2001) The first incarnation of Warmen was composed of Janne, guitarist Sami Virtanen and drummer Mirka Rantanen. This line-up successfully recorded and released the Unknown Soldier album in the same year of the band's formation, with the collaboration of guest singer Kimberly Goss (from Sinergy), guitarist Roope Latvala (also from Sinergy, later also from Children of Bodom) and bassist Jari Kainulainen (from Stratovarius). Beyond Abilities (2002–2004) On the following year, the band saw the addition of Lauri Porra (later in Sinergy and Stratovarius) and Janne's guitarist brother, Antti Wirman (from Kotipelto). In the Warmen Productions Studio (now called Beyond Abilities), this line-up recorded the album Beyond Abilities, a progressive metal album that received critical appraisal. With a more prominent and diverse use of vocals, this album made use of the talent of Timo Kotipelto (from Stratovarius), Pasi Nykänen (from Throne of Chaos) and returning vocalist Kimberly Goss.
