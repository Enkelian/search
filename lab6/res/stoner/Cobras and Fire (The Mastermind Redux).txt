Cobras and Fire (The Mastermind Redux)
Cobras and Fire (The Mastermind Redux) is the eleventh studio album by the American stoner rock band Monster Magnet. The album is a reworking of material previously included on Mastermind (2010).In regards to the album, Dave Wyndorf told Blabbermouth.net: With 'Cobras And Fire', I wanted to present these songs in a much stranger and dirtier atmosphere. Less 'classic rock' and more… well, I'd guess I'd call it a deranged fusion of garage-psych, fuzz punk and movie soundtrack music. It's almost completely re-recorded and, as in 'Milking The Stars', I've added organ, piano, sitars and more to flesh out a completely new sound for these tunes.
