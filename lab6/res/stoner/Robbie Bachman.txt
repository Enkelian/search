Robbie Bachman
Robin Peter Kendall "Robbie" Bachman (born February 18, 1953, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada) is a drummer and the youngest brother of Canadian guitarist, singer and songwriter Randy Bachman. He was the original drummer for both the Brave Belt and Bachman–Turner Overdrive bands. He is sometimes credited as "Robin" or "Rob" on the liner notes of Brave Belt and BTO albums. While growing up, Bachman practiced the drums at home, often playing along with his older brother Randy. When Robbie was age 18, Randy offered him the Brave Belt drumming job, and Robbie accepted. Other members of Brave Belt were Chad Allan and Fred Turner. In 1972, another Bachman brother, Tim, joined Brave Belt after the departure of Allan. When Brave Belt changed their name to Bachman–Turner Overdrive in 1973, Robbie was credited with designing the BTO 'gear' logo. Robbie co-wrote one of Bachman–Turner Overdrive's biggest hits, "Roll on Down the Highway" (with Fred Turner). He remained with BTO until late 1979, after their tour supporting the 1979 album Rock n' Roll Nights had ended. In 1984, he declined to join a reformation of BTO due to licensing issues and Randy Bachman's decision to include Tim Bachman as the second guitarist,
