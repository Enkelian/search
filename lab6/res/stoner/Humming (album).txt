Humming (album)
Humming is the second album by American singer-songwriter Duncan Sheik. It was released on Atlantic Records in 1998. Release and reception The album was met with moderate success and favorable reviews. According to Allmusic, the album "sprawls across similarly introspective terrain, yet veers more toward the pragmatic than the romantic", adding, "Humming has a more profound and resonant base, complemented by accentuated drums and various string elements." Details The album, which featured the London Session Orchestra on some tracks, contained tributes to other artists, including "That Says It All" and "A Body Goes Down"; the latter song is an elegy for Jeff Buckley, following his death in 1997, which was also included in the documentary Amazing Grace: Jeff Buckley. The final track is named after Nichiren, who was a Buddhist monk of 13th century Japan.
