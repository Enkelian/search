Dust (band)
Dust was an American hard rock band active in the early 1970s. History Dust was formed in 1969 by Richie Wise and two teenagers, Kenny Aaronson and Marc Bell. The trio's producer and manager, Kenny Kerner, also wrote the group's lyrics. Their eponymous debut album was released on Kama Sutra Records in 1971, followed by a sophomore release, Hard Attack, issued on the same label the following year. Although Wise began writing material for a third album, the band dissolved due to lack of promotion and Wise's interest in producing.While the group only released these two albums, they later became of historical interest to collectors of early American heavy metal. Both albums were reissued on April 16, 2013, as a combined CD set titled Hard Attack / Dust (Legacy Recordings), as well as on vinyl on April 20 for Record Store Day. Later projects Wise and Kerner went into production with Kiss, among others, producing that band's first two albums. Bell's next project after Dust was Estus; he played on their 1973 eponymous album. In the mid-1970s, he joined Richard Hell & the Voidoids, playing on their first album, Blank Generation). In 1978, he replaced Thomas Erdelyi in the Ramones,
