Broadcasting & Cable
Broadcasting & Cable is a weekly television industry trade magazine published by Future US. Previous names included Broadcasting-Telecasting, Broadcasting and Broadcast Advertising, and Broadcasting. B&C, which was published biweekly until January 1941, and weekly thereafter, covers the business of television in the U.S.—programming, advertising, regulation, technology, finance, and news. In addition to the newsweekly, B&C operates a comprehensive website that provides a roadmap for readers in an industry that is in constant flux due to shifts in technology, culture and legislation, and offers a forum for industry debate and criticism. History Broadcasting was founded in Washington, D.C., by Martin Codel, Sol Taishoff, and former National Association of Broadcasters president Harry Shaw, and the first issue was published on October 15, 1931. Originally, Shaw was publisher, Codel editor, and Taishoff managing editor; when Shaw retired, Codel became publisher and Taishoff took over as editor-in-chief. (Taishoff had succeeded Codel writing the radio column for the Consolidated Press Association, both men using the pseudonym “Robert Mack”; the two met while covering radio in Washington.) The men operated under the corporate name Broadcasting Publications, Inc.; after Shaw's departure, the company was owned by Codel, Taishoff, and their wives. Codel left the magazine in January,
