Albuquerque Journal
The Albuquerque Journal is the largest newspaper in the U.S. state of New Mexico. History The Golden Gate newspaper was founded in June 1880. In the fall of 1880, the owner of the Golden Gate died and Journal Publishing Company was created. Journal Publishing changed the paper name to Albuquerque Daily Journal and issued its first edition of the Albuquerque Daily Journal on October 14, 1880. The Daily Journal was first published in Old Town Albuquerque, but in 1882 the publication moved to a single room in the so-called new town (or expanded Albuquerque) at Second and Silver streets near the railroad tracks. It was published on a single sheet of newsprint, folded to make four pages. Those pages were divided into five columns with small headlines. Advertising appeared on the front page. The Daily Journal was published in the evening until the first Territorial Fair opened in October 1881. On October 4 of that year, a morning Journal was published in order to record the day’s events at the fair. The morning Daily Journal continued for six issues. The last issue was published on Sunday, October 9 – making it the first Sunday newspaper to appear in Albuquerque. In
