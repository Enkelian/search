History The area around Workington has long been a producer of coal and steel. Between AD 79 and 122, Roman forts, mile-forts and watchtowers were established along the Cumbrian coast. They were coastal defences against attacks by the Scoti from Ireland and by the Caledonii, the most powerful tribe in what is now Scotland. The 16th-century Britannia, written by William Camden describes ruins of the coastal defences at Workington.A Viking sword was discovered at Northside, which is believed to indicate that there was a settlement at the river's mouth.The place-name of Workington is first attested in an Anglo-Saxon charter of 946, where it appears as Wurcingtun. It appears as Wirchingetona in about 1150, meaning "the town or settlement of Weorc or Wirc's people".Several bridges were damaged or destroyed by the River Derwent
