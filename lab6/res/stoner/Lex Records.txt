Lex Records
Lex Records is an independent record label based in Camden, London. Style Lex has a varied musical output. The label is not focused on one particular genre (although most releases are alternative hip hop, alternative rock or electronica) and instead focuses on working with a small group of individual artists, supporting their work. As a result of the small roster, Lex has a low volume of releases, rarely releasing more than three albums annually.Dazed described Lex as a label "...whose wildly creative output spans over a decade of landmark releases that have changed the music industry no end."Lex albums are often collaborations between members of the label roster and musicians from elsewhere. These collaborative groups include Danger Mouse with MF Doom as Danger Doom, Boom Bip with Gruff Rhys as Neon Neon, Jneiro Jarel with Khujo Goodie as Willie Isz, and Jneiro Jarel with MF Doom as JJ DOOM. Recent releases include the debut album from Nevermen, The Prefuse 73 & Michael Christmas joint album Lady Parts as Fudge and the release of Let Them Eat Chaos by Kate Tempest in the USA. Lex packaging is striking and often elaborate. Much of the Lex sleeve artwork is created by Ehquestionmark.
