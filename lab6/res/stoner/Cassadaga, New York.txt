History Cassadaga is a Seneca name meaning "water under the rocks", descriptive of the natural springs of the area flowing from glacial moraines. In dry weather, many of the local streams would "disappear", and the spring-fed water runs wholly within the gravelly bottoms of the stream beds draining from the surrounding hills. Cassadaga was settled by European Americans in 1848 at the headwaters of the technically navigable Cassadaga Creek. Practically, the upper few miles of it are not navigable in the 21st century, due to numerous shallows and beaver activity along its course. Many of the settlers had migrated from New England and eastern New York after the American Revolutionary War. They gradually migrated westward as this territory was opened up for settlement after the Seneca people and other Iroquois
