Thorium(IV) chloride
Thorium(IV) chloride (ThCl4) is an inorganic chemical compound. In addition to the anhydrous ThCl4, two hydrates have been reported: ThCl4(H2O)4 and ThCl4(H2O)8. These hygroscopic salts are water-soluble and white, at room temperature. Similar to other thorium complexes thorium(IV) chloride has a high melting point 770 째C (1,418 째F) and a boiling point of 921 째C (1,690 째F). Like all the other actinides, thorium is radioactive and has sometimes been used in the production of nuclear energy. Thorium(IV) chloride does not appear naturally but instead is derived from Thorite, Thorianite, or Monazite which are naturally occurring formations. History Thorium was first discovered by Jons Jacob Berzelius in 1828. After receiving a sample of minerals from his colleague Jens Esmarck, Berzelius was able to isolate thorium using a method that had been used for other metals like cerium, zirconium, and titanium. This process involved using alkali metals to disassociate the thorium from its prior ligand form ThSiO4 (further described in synthesis). An intermediate in the isolation process was thorium(IV) chloride and thus the compound was discovered. Structures The structure of thorium(IV) chloride is square planar with a symmetry of D4h. In this coordinate compound the bond length between the Th-Cl bond is
