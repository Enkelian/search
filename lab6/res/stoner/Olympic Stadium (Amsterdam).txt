Olympic Stadium (Amsterdam)
The Olympic Stadium (Dutch: Olympisch Stadion) is the main stadium for the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. The venue is currently used mostly for athletics, music events and other sport events. When completed, the stadium had a capacity of 31,600. Following the completion of the rival De Kuip stadium in Rotterdam in 1937, the Amsterdam authorities increased the capacity of the Olympic Stadium to 64,000 by adding a second ring to the stadium. In 1987 the stadium was listed as a national monument. AFC Ajax used the Olympic Stadium for international games until 1996, when the Amsterdam Arena, since 2018 named Johan Cruyff Arena, was completed. Renovation started in 1996, and the stadium was refurbished into the original construction of 1928. The second ring of 1937 was removed, reducing capacity to 22,288, and the stadium was made suitable for track and field competitions again. Since 2005, the stadium is home to a sports museum, the Olympic Experience Amsterdam. Architecture and design The Olympic Stadium was designed by architect Jan Wils, and is one of the finest examples of Amsterdamse School architecture, complementing the surrounding neighbourhood designed by H.P. Berlage. The design won the Olympic gold medal in the architecture competition
