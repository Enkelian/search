Methylnaltrexone
Methylnaltrexone (MNTX, brand name Relistor), used in form of methylnaltrexone bromide (INN, USAN, BAN), is a medication that acts as a peripherally acting μ-opioid receptor antagonist that acts to reverse some of the side effects of opioid drugs such as constipation without significantly affecting pain relief or precipitating withdrawals. Because MNTX is a quaternary ammonium cation, it cannot cross the blood–brain barrier, and so has antagonist effects throughout the body, counteracting effects such as itching and constipation, but without affecting opioid effects in the brain such as pain relief. However, since a significant fraction (up to 60%) of opioid analgesia can be mediated by opioid receptors on peripheral sensory neurons, particularly in inflammatory conditions such as arthritis, traumatic or surgical pain, MNTX may increase pain under such circumstances. Medical uses Methylnaltrexone is approved for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC). It is generally only to be used when ordinary laxatives have failed. Mechanism of action Methylnaltrexone binds to the same receptors as opioid analgesics such as morphine and oxycodone, but it acts as an antagonist, blocking the effects of those analgesics mainly on the peripheral opioid receptors, specifically the constipating effects on the gastrointestinal tract. Furthermore, as methylnaltrexone cannot cross
