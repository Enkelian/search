Queen at Wembley
Queen Live at Wembley Stadium, also referred to as Queen Live At Wembley, Queen At Wembley, Queen Live At Wembley '86, Live At Wembley and Live At Wembley '86, is a recording of a concert at the original Wembley Stadium, London, England on Saturday 12 July 1986 during Queen's Magic Tour and transmitted and released in various audio and video forms (including the Queen: Live at Wembley Stadium DVD). Transmission and release history The recorded concert was first seen as a ‘The Tube Special’ on TV. This was transmitted in mono (as was normal before NICAM stereo became standard on UK TV in the early 1990s). However, it was simultaneously broadcast over the radio in stereo so that viewers had the option to mute their televisions, play the audio on a nearby radio and enjoy “the world’s first ever stereo simulcast” in a similar way that previous live (as opposed to, in this case, pre-recorded) classical performances had sometimes been offered. The recording was first commercially released in December 1990 as an edited VHS (missing 9 songs), then as the Live at Wembley '86 audio CD in 1992. This was followed by a DVD release as Queen: Live at Wembley
