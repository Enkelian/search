However, a live recording from the 1979 album Strangers in the Night was released as a single and became the first hit for the band. In 2010, a live version with Vinnie Moore was released in the Best of a Decade album.UFO and Schenker's subsequent band, the Michael Schenker Group, continue to play "Doctor Doctor" live at almost all of their concerts. It has been covered by several heavy metal bands, most notably by Iron Maiden. == References ==
