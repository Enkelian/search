South Florida Sun-Sentinel
The Sun Sentinel (also known as the South Florida Sun Sentinel, known until 2008 as the Sun-Sentinel, and stylized on its masthead as SunSentinel) is the main daily newspaper of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, as well as surrounding Broward County and southern Palm Beach County. Owned by Tribune Publishing, it circulates all throughout the three counties that comprise South Florida. It is the largest-circulation newspaper in the area. Nancy Meyer has held the position of publisher and Julie Anderson has held the position of editor-in-chief since February 2018.The newspaper was for many years branded as the Sun-Sentinel, with a hyphen, until a redesign and rebranding on August 17, 2008. The new look also removed the space between "Sun" and "Sentinel" in the newspaper's flag, but its name retained the space. Overview For many years, the Sun Sentinel targeted Broward County and provided only limited news coverage in Palm Beach County. However, in the late 1990s, it expanded its coverage to all of South Florida, including Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties, in the late 1990s. In the former area, The Miami Herald is its primary competition, while in the latter area, The Palm Beach Post is the chief competition. The Sun Sentinel
