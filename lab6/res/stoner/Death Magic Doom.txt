Death Magic Doom
Death Magic Doom is the tenth studio album by the Swedish epic doom metal band Candlemass. History The working title for this album was "Hammer of Doom", which is the name of the album's second track, but the idea was abandoned due to there being a German festival of the same name. The band recorded it during the autumn of 2008, and was seeking a release on 27 March 2009. However, the album's release was delayed until 3 April 2009; the United States release date for this album was May 5, 2009. The bonus track on the digipak edition, "Lucifer Rising", was taken from the EP Lucifer Rising, released six months before the album. Track listing All songs written by Leif Edling.
