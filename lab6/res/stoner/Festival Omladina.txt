Festival Omladina
Festival Omladina (English: Youth Festival), also known as Omladinski festival, is a music festival held in Subotica, Serbia. The festival was founded in 1961 as a competition of young composers of popular music. Their compositions were performed by pop singers, but soon the performers of competing compositions became rock bands. In the 1970s, the non-competitive part, featuring established rock acts, was added to the program, and in the 1980s it became a competition of young rock bands. During the years, some of the most notable acts of the Yugoslav pop and rock scene performed on the festival. In 1990, at the beginning of the breakup of Yugoslavia, the festival ceased to exist. In 2011 the festival anniversary was celebrated with a concert of famous acts who made their first steps on the festival, and in 2012 the festival was reestablished. 1961 The festival was founded by the members of Mladost (Youth) Society for Culture and Arts, as a competition of young popular music composers. More than 120 compositions by composers from all parts of Yugoslavia were sent to the competition, 9 of which were chosen to be performed at the festival. The festival was held on 4 and 5 December
