Headbangers Ball Tour
The Headbangers Ball Tour was a North American tour presented by MTV's Headbangers Ball, which took place in April and May 1989. It was headlined by American thrash metal band Anthrax, and supported by Exodus and Helloween. History The tour began on April 3, 1989 in Seattle, and ended on May 12, 1989 in Poughkeepsie. Anthrax was promoting their platinum-selling album State of Euphoria, while Exodus and Helloween were promoting their respective albums Fabulous Disaster and Keeper of the Seven Keys, Pt. 2. The Headbangers Ball Tour is notable for being Exodus' last tour with drummer Tom Hunting, until he rejoined the band in 1997. Due to Hunting's health problems, Exodus' show at the Sunken Gardens was cancelled, and Hunting was subsequently replaced by John Tempesta, who would remain in Exodus until their breakup in 1993. MTV and Island Records paired up for a Headbangers Ball Tour contest. The winner was Lori Gutman who lived in Kinnelon, NJ. Members of Anthrax and Exodus taped a spot for Headbangers Ball at the winner's home. It aired later that year. The grand prize was a 1989 Jeep Wrangler, $1,000, and some Headbangers Ball swag.
