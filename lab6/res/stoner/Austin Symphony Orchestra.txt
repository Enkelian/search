Austin Symphony Orchestra
The Austin Symphony Orchestra is the oldest performing group in Austin, Texas. It was founded in 1911, and celebrated its centenary year in 2011. The inaugural concert was held on April 25, 1911. Initially, the orchestra consisted of 28 unpaid members and an unpaid conductor. It now has over 90 members, but is still not a full-time orchestra. It was not until 1948 that a paid Music Director was appointed - Ezra Rachlin being the first appointee – and a regular concert series was presented. Rachlin remained in the post for 21 years, until 1969. The current, and eighth, Music Director of the Austin Symphony Orchestra is Peter Bay, who has been in the post since 1997. Past Directors include Maurice Peress (1970–73), Akira Endo and Sung Kwak.Ezra Rachlin organised a drive-in concert, the world's first, in 1948.
