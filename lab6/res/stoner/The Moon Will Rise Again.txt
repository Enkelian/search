The Moon Will Rise Again
The Moon Will Rise Again is the second album by Mississippi band The Cooters. It was produced and recorded by Rick Clark in October 1998 at Ardent Studios in Memphis, Tennessee. The album's release was delayed for some time after drummer Judas Cooter was incarcerated at the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman in 1999, and The Cooters were involved in a trademark dispute over their name. After all the legal hurdles were cleared, Grammy-nominated producer Tim Ramenofsky picked the album up in 2002 and released it on his T-Bones Records label alongside artists Afroman, Loppybogymi, and the Dukes of Jazzard.
