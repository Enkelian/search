Sunnyside Garden Arena
The Sunnyside Garden Arena was a popular boxing venue. The old red brick arena, at the southwest corner of 45th Street and Queens Boulevard, in Sunnyside, Queens, New York City, seated about 2,500. It consisted of two parallel gables perpendicular to the street fronted by a lower, flat-roofed entry. Across the entry was a large neon sign and below that, just above the main entrance, was a large clock. History Built in the 1920s, the building is variously reported to have been either a private tennis club and/or the personal tennis court and carriage house of millionaire Jay Gould II.In the mid forties, the building was sold to Harry Jordan Lee of Long Beach, New York, who partnered with Manny Heicklen to open it as a boxing and wrestling venue in 1947. Heicklen eventually bought out Lee and remained in charge until his death in 1969. The reins then passed to promoter Mike Rosenberg until the arena was sold to Mike Prudenti of Astoria in 1973. This apparently didn’t work out and the arena was closed for two years until late 1975. Under promoters Nick Anesi and Vic Manni, it lasted until 1977, when it was replaced by a Wendy’s
