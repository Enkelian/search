Alpha Phi
Alpha Phi International Women's Fraternity (ΑΦ, also known as APhi) is a sorority with 172 active chapters and over 250,000 initiated members. Founded at Syracuse University in Syracuse, New York on September 18, 1872, it is the fourth Greek-letter organization founded for women, and the first "sorority" founded for women in the northeast. Alpha Phi is a member of the National Panhellenic Conference, the governing council of 26 women's fraternities. Its own national headquarters are located in Evanston, Illinois. History At the time of the founding there were only 666 women attending Syracuse; ten of them eventually formed of Alpha Phi to found an organization "on the principles of the promotion of growth in character; unity of feeling, sisterly affection, and social communion among the members." Although the actual founding date is September 18, 1872, Alpha Phi has been celebrating their Founder's Day on October 10 since 1902, since many colleges and universities were not open for classes in mid-September at that time. Alpha Phi considers itself a women's fraternity because its founding date predates the invention of the word "sorority". Founders Alpha Phi's founding members were: Martha Emily Foote Crow – Martha "Mattie" Foote Crow (1854 – January 1,
