Alpha Kappa Lambda
Alpha Kappa Lambda (ΑΚΛ), commonly known as AKL or Alpha Kapp, is an American collegiate social fraternity founded at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1914. Today, it operates approximately 31 active chapters and 1 coloniy and has approximately 28,000 initiated members. History and tradition Alpha Kappa Lambda was founded on April 22, 1914, by a group of young men attending the University of California, Berkeley. Its birth, however, dates back to 1906 when a group of friends discussed the "need of Christian men for a place to live and study that was within their (financial) means." After assisting in the cleanup of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, four students re-addressed their desire to organize a house club during a YMCA conference in Pacific Grove, California. They decided to form "Los Amigos" in 1907, a house club named from the Spanish translation of "The Friends." Shortly after, seven more men joined Los Amigos. Reverend Gail Cleland, one of the original eleven members of Los Amigos, recalled, "when we organized Los Amigos as a house club...house clubs and fraternities were dime a dozen. They came, they lived for a few months or a few years, then they went out of existence
