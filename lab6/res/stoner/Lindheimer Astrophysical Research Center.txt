Lindheimer Astrophysical Research Center
Lindheimer Astrophysical Research Center was an astronomical observatory used for teaching and research, located on the Evanston, Illinois campus of Northwestern University. The structure was built in 1966 and was demolished in 1995. History The Center was constructed in 1966 on the Lake Michigan shore in the northeast corner of the recently completed Northwestern University Lakefill and its twin domes and distinctive crisscrossed supporting braces instantly made it a campus landmark. That year, the Chicago Chapter of the American Institute of Architects designated the structure as outstanding in its class.The observatory building which housed the Center originally cost approximately one million dollars. It was funded by a gift from the estate of prominent Chicago businessman and sporting executive Benjamin F. Lindheimer along with a grant from the National Science Foundation. The telescopes were funded mainly by grants from the A. Montgomery Ward Foundation, the Hans D. Isenberg Foundation, and the National Science Foundation.The facility's domes contained two large telescopes manufactured by premium instrument maker Boller and Chivens. Beneath the smaller dome was a 16-inch Cassegrain reflector, intended mainly for student use. Beneath the larger dome was a 40-inch Cassegrain equipped with a rapid-scanning optical spectrometer, intended especially for astronomical research.By
