KTSB
KTSB-CD, virtual and UHF digital channel 35, is a low-powered, Class A UniMÃ¡s-affiliated television station licensed to Santa Maria, California, United States. Owned by Entravision Communications, it is a sister station to Santa Barbara-licensed Univision affiliate KPMR (channel 38). The two stations share studios on Fairway Drive in Santa Maria; KTSB-CD's transmitter is located on Tepusquet Peak in Los Padres National Forest east of Santa Maria. History The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) granted a construction permit on September 28, 1995 to build a low-power television station on UHF channel 43 to serve Santa Barbara. Melissa Harnett was the originally owner of the station, which was given the callsign K43FA. Harnett licensed the station on July 10, 1997. In June 1998, following the allotment of channel 43 to Los Angeles independent station KCAL-TV for their digital facilities, Harnett attempted to move the station to a location about 15 mi (25 km) away, change the channel assignment to UHF 29 and to increase the power to the maximum 150 kW. The application would eventually be dismissed by the FCC. In October 1998, Harnett agreed to sell the station to JB Broadcasting Inc. The sale was approved by the FCC in April 1999
