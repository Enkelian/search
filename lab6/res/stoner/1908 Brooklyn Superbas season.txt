1908 Brooklyn Superbas season
The 1908 Brooklyn Superbas suffered through another poor season, finishing in seventh place. After the season, manager Patsy Donovan was fired. The club set a Major League record which still stands, for the fewest doubles by a team in a season, with only 110. The Superbas hit only .213 as a team, second lowest in the modern era after the 1910 Chicago White Sox. No regulars hit .250, Tim Jordan led the team with a .247 batting average. Offseason December 17, 1907: Tommy Sheehan was purchased by the Superbas from the Pittsburgh Pirates.
