Prostitution in Greece
Prostitution in Greece is legal at the age of 18, and regulated. It is estimated that fewer than 1,000 women are legally employed as prostitutes and approximately 20,000 women, half of whom are if foreign origin and the other half are Greek, are engaged in illegal prostitution.

The women must be over 18; unmarried; have the right to live and work in Greece; be free from STIs; not suffer from mental illness; not have a drug addiction; and not have been convicted of homicide, pimping, child porn, trafficking, robbery or blackmail. They must register at the local prefecture and carry a medical card that is updated every two weeks.Greek authorities decided to implement a 1999 law which stipulates that all brothels must have permits. Permits are issued by the state, usually to older women. Many of these women are former prostitutes. Brothels must be at least 200m from public buildings. It was proposed this should be reduced to 100m ahead of the 2004 Athens Olympics but the Greek government did not act on
