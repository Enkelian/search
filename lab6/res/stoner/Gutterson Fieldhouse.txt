Gutterson Fieldhouse
Gutterson Fieldhouse (a.k.a. "The Gut") is a 4,035-seat hockey arena in Burlington, Vermont. It is home to the Vermont Catamounts men's and women's ice hockey teams. It is the largest indoor arena in the state of Vermont. It is adjacent to Patrick Gymnasium at the school's athletic complex. It is named for Albert Gutterson, class of 1912, the school's first Olympian. He set an Olympic record with a 7.60 meter long jump, beating, among others, the great Jim Thorpe. History The barrel-vaulted arena opened in 1963, originally seating 3,335. It was expanded to its current capacity in 1990. The hockey team has played host to exhibitions with the Soviet Union national ice hockey team, Russia women's national ice hockey team, and United States men's national ice hockey team and United States women's national ice hockey team. It was the venue for the first women's hockey game ever nationally televised in the US (on December 17, 1997, a pre-Olympic game between Canada and the United States). Between 1995 and 2000, and again in 2002, it was the preseason training camp site of the New York Rangers. (The Hartford Whalers had previously held their 1992 and 1993 training camps there.)
