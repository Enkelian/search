BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend
BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend (previously known as One Big Weekend, for 2012 as Radio 1's Hackney Weekend, and for 2018 as BBC Music's Biggest Weekend) is a music festival run by BBC Radio 1. It is held once a year, in a different location within the United Kingdom each time. It was previously the biggest free ticketed music event in Europe, until a fee for tickets was introduced in 2018, and always includes a host of new artists. The festival is a spin-off of Radio 1's "One Big Sunday", where in each Sunday during July and August, a different town would host the roadshow, usually next to a beach or in a large park. These were also free, but non-ticketed. Both events are successors to the Radio 1 Roadshow which toured the country during every summer from 1973 until the 1990s. Originally a "One Big Weekend" would run twice a year, although that last happened in 2004 since when it has been held once a year instead - usually in May, with the exception of 2012 when a larger festival took place over the weekend of 23â€“24 June in Hackney, East London.The form of the event has varied over
