Ophthalmic artery
The ophthalmic artery (OA) is the first branch of the internal carotid artery distal to the cavernous sinus. Branches of the OA supply all the structures in the orbit as well as some structures in the nose, face and meninges. Occlusion of the OA or its branches can produce sight-threatening conditions. Structure The OA emerges from the internal carotid artery usually just after the latter emerges from the cavernous sinus although in some cases, the OA branches just before the internal carotid exits the cavernous sinus. The OA arises from the internal carotid along the medial side of the anterior clinoid process and runs anteriorly passing through the optic canal with and inferolaterally to the optic nerve. The ophthalmic artery can also pass superiorly to the optic nerve in a minority of cases. In the posterior third of the cone of the orbit, the ophthalmic artery turns sharply and medially to run along the medial wall of the orbit. Central retinal artery The central retinal artery is the first, and one of the smaller branches of the OA and runs in the dura mater inferior to the optic nerve. About 12.5mm (0.5 inch) posterior to the globe, the central retinal
