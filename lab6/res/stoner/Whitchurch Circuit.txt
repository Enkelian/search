Whitchurch Circuit
Whitchurch Circuit was a motor racing circuit located at the former Bristol (Whitchurch) Airport in Bristol, England. The Bristol & Wessex Aeroplane Club first flew from this airfield in 1930. During World War II it was used by the Air Transport Auxiliary and British Overseas Airways Corporation. It continued as Bristol's commercial airport until in 1957 this moved to Bristol Lulsgate Airport, where the Lulsgate Circuit had been. On 1 August 1959, the Bristol Motorcycle and Light Car Club (BM&LCC) organised the first race meeting in conjunction with the Bristol Corporation, who owned the then disused airfield at Whitchurch. The course was 1.0625 miles (1.71 km) long, almost flat, and rectangular in shape with four corners known as Dundry, Hangar, Knowle, and Goram. The meeting consisted of six races, one of which was for Formula Two cars. This race was won by Henry Taylor, at a speed of 66.03 mph (106.26 km/h), from Keith Greene and Tim Parnell, all of whom were Cooper mounted. The fastest lap was set by Taylor at 66.64 mph (107.25 km/h). However, the fastest lap of the day was set by a Formula III car in exactly 53 seconds (72.17 mph (116.15 km/h)) by Jack
