C Moon
"C Moon" is a pop song with a reggae beat, written by Paul and Linda McCartney and performed by Wings. It was released as a double A-side with "Hi, Hi, Hi" in 1972. The single reached No. 5 on the UK Singles Chart and since "Hi Hi Hi" was banned by the BBC, "C Moon" received much airplay in the United Kingdom. In the United States, "C Moon" did not appear on any of the major record charts. Lyrics and structure The name "C Moon" was inspired by lyrics in the song "Wooly Bully" by Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs. McCartney said, "There's a line in [Wooly Bully] that says, 'Let's not be L7.' Well, L7, it was explained at the time, means a squareâ€”put L and 7 together and you get a square... So I thought of the idea of putting a C and a moon together (a half-moon) to get the opposite of a square. So 'C Moon' means cool, in other words."The recording includes a missed-cue intro that was kept in the released version.The song is in the key of C and is in 4/4 time. The performers change instruments from their usual places. Guitarist Henry
