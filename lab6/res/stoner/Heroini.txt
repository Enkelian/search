Heroini
Heroini is a fish tribe from the Cichlasomatinae subfamily in the cichlid family. All cichlids native to the Greater Antilles, United States (southern Texas), Mexico and northern Central America are members of this tribe. It also includes most cichlid species in southern Central America (where only non-Heroini cichlids are Andinoacara and Geophagus) and several species from South America (where several other tribes exist). A large percentage of its species were formerly placed in the genus Cichlasoma (itself now placed in the tribe Cichlasomatini), but have since been moved to other genera. In other classifications the tribe Heroini is placed in the subfamily Cichlinae. Genera This tribe include about 35 genus and 160 species: Amatitlania Schmitter-Soto, 2007 Amphilophus Agassiz, 1859 Archocentrus Gill, 1877 Astatheros Pellegrin, 1904 Australoheros Říčan & Kullander, 2006 Caquetaia Fowler, 1945 Chiapaheros McMahan & Piller, 2015 Chocoheros Říčan & Piálek, 2016 Chortiheros Říčan & Piálek, 2016 Cincelichthys McMahan & Piller, 2015 Cryptoheros Allgayer, 2001 Darienheros Říčan & Novák 2016 Herichthys Baird & Girard, 1854 Heroina Kullander, 1996 Heros Heckel, 1840 Herotilapia Pellegrin, 1904 Hoplarchus Kaup, 1860 Hypselecara Kullander, 1986 Hypsophrys Agassiz, 1859 Isthmoheros (Meek & Hildebrand, 1913) Kihnichthys McMahan & Matamoros, 2015 Kronoheros Říčan & Piálek, 2016 Maskaheros
