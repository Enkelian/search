Iodine monochloride
Iodine monochloride is an interhalogen compound with the formula ICl. It is a red-brown chemical compound that melts near room temperature. Because of the difference in the electronegativity of iodine and chlorine, ICl is highly polar and behaves as a source of I+. Iodine monochloride is produced simply by combining the halogens in a 1:1 molar ratio, according to the equation I2 + Cl2 → 2 IClWhen chlorine gas is passed through iodine crystals, one observes the brown vapor of iodine monochloride. Dark brown iodine monochloride liquid is collected. Excess chlorine converts iodine monochloride into iodine trichloride in a reversible reaction: ICl + Cl2 ⇌ ICl3 Polymorphs ICl has two polymorphs; α-ICl, which exists as black needles (red by transmitted light) with a melting point of 27.2 °C, and β-ICl, which exists as black platelets (red-brown by transmitted light) with a melting point 13.9 °C.In the crystal structures of both polymorphs the molecules are arranged in zigzag chains. β-ICl is monoclinic with the space group P21/c. Reactions and uses Iodine monochloride is soluble in acids such as HF and HCl but reacts with pure water to form HCl and iodine: 4 ICl + 2 H2O → 4 HCl + 2
