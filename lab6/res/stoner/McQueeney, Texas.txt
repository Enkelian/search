McQueeney, Texas
McQueeney is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Guadalupe County, Texas, United States. The population was 2,545 at the 2010 census. It is part of the San Antonio Metropolitan Statistical Area. History German settlers first moved to the area around 1870. When the Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio railroad was built through the area in 1876, the stop was named "Hilda". In 1900, a local businessman, C. F. Blumberg, built a general store east of the rail stop. Hoping to get the railroad to move the stop from Hilda to his store, Blumberg called the site "McQueeney", in honor of the local railroad superintendent. The railroad was not persuaded, but the post office that opened in 1900 was called McQueeney. Lake McQueeney was created in 1925 by damming the Guadalupe River. Treasure Island, a wealthy enclave of homeowners on the lake, has flooded several times, most notably in 1972, 1998, and 2002.
