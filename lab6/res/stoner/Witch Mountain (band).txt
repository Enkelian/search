After a July 2009 show opening for Pentagram, guest singer Uta was asked to join the band as main vocalist, marking a revival of the band. Witch Mountain's second full-length album, South of Salem, was recorded six months later at Smegma Studios, produced by Billy Anderson, and released in April 2011, coinciding with a SXSW tour. In November 2011, Witch Mountain was signed with Profound Lore. As of their February 17, 2012 South of Salem CD release show, Dave parted with the band to concentrate on family and other projects, leaving bass duties to Billions and Billions member Neal Munson. Witch Mountain released their third full-length album, Cauldron of the Wild, on June 12, 2012.Neal Munson left the band in July 2013.
