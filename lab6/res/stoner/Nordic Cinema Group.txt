Nordic Cinema Group
Nordic Cinema Group is a Swedish company which owns 103 cinemas and 590 cinema saloons in six countries (Sweden, Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania). Between 2013 and 2017 it was owned by both Bridgepoint and Bonnier Group. It was founded in 2013 through a merger of Filmstaden in Sweden, Odeon Kino in Norway, Finnkino in Finland and Forum Cinemas in the baltics. In 2017, it was bought by AMC Theatres and merged into Odeon Cinemas Group. But it still exists as the parent holding company for the local companies. == References ==
