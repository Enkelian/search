Long Time Coming (Jonny Lang album)
Long Time Coming is the fourth studio album by Jonny Lang, recorded at MF Studio and The Attic, Monrovia, California, and released on October 14, 2003, when he was 22. This fourth album from the still relatively young Lang had been a "long time coming", with five years passing since the release of Wander This World. Lang incorporated more R&B influences into his overall musical style, without neglecting his love for the blues. The album has more rock-elements compared to his previous work, and features one ballad with beat and arrangement comparable to modern R&B/Pop ("Touch"). One of the songs is a cover of Edgar Winter's "Dying to Live". The album also features Aerosmith's Steven Tyler on "Happiness and Misery," where he plays the harmonica.
