Emperor Rosko
Michael Joseph "Mike" Pasternak (born 26 December 1942), known by his stage name Emperor Rosko, is an American presenter of pop music programmes, most widely known for his shows on Radio Caroline and BBC Radio 1 in the UK in the 1960s and early 1970s. Early life Born in Los Angeles, California, he is the son of Hollywood film producer Joe Pasternak. He was influenced in his career choice by KYA Radio DJs Lord Tim Hudson and Wolfman Jack in Los Angeles. Pasternak's opportunity to broadcast came whilst in the US Navy where he presented a show on the aircraft carrier USS Coral Sea, using the name Michael Prescott. He then moved to Europe and hosted sponsored programmes in France and Andorra. Origin of stage name In an interview with Chris Edwards, for Offshore Echoes, Rosko explained: "I used to listen to a guy named Roscoe, who used to listen to a guy called Boscoe and the double-syllable name ending in "o" was synonymous with rhythm and rhyme which was a precursor to rap. I also used to listen to several other people like Wolfman, Tom Donahue, etc. So I took a little bit of everybody and became Emperor Rosko
