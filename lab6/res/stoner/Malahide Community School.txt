Malahide Community School
Malahide Community School (MCS; Irish: Pobalscoil Íosa) is a co-educational secondary school located in Malahide, County Dublin, Ireland. It welcomes pupils of all religious denominations. The school grew from 512 students in 1976 to 1200 students by 2006, and remains at around 1200 in 2018. History In the early 1950s Catherine Dowling set up the Stella Maris School in Malahide village. In 1958 the Infant Jesus Sisters founded Scoil Íosa, a junior and secondary school for girls on what are now the grounds of Malahide Community School. Mrs Dowling amalgamated her school with the convent and joined the staff of the newly established school. In 1976 the school joined the community school system which meant that it was no longer private, and became Pobalscoil Íosa. The school population at that time was just over 500. A new, fully equipped building, now known as the Junior Block was added, followed shortly afterward by a sports hall. The new building A three-storey school building, planned in 2005 for a November 2006 opening, was the subject of multiple delays, and finally opened in February 2007. The first part of the demolition was started in March 2006, and was completed before the Leaving Certificate
