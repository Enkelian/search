Background and recording Regarding the use of the name OCS and his return to the project's lo-fi roots, John Dwyer noted: "[Oh Sees and OCS] are two different bands honestly. Two different line-ups. The origin of the OCS came from this band [Orinoka Crash Suite]. We just wanted to get back to writing like that. But I also wanted to write a record with Brigid Dawson. I wanted to do something specifically with her. And it ended up being a lot of fun so Iâ€™m glad we did it." Track listing Personnel MusiciansJohn Dwyer - vocals, guitars,
