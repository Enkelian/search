Batis maritima
Batis maritima, the saltwort or beachwort (also known as turtleweed, pickleweed, barilla, planta de sal, camphire, herbe-à-crâbes, and akulikuli-kai), is a halophyte. It is a C3-plant, long-lived perennial, dioecious, succulent shrub. The plant forms dense colonies in salt marshes, brackish marshes, and mangrove swamps and frequently is found on the margins of saltpans and wind-tidal flats. Batis maritima is a pioneer plant, covers quickly areas where hurricanes have destroyed the natural vegetation. So far, Batis maritima has not been used commercially for food production but the seeds have a high oil content with high nutritional value. Morphology Plants are dioecious, perennial sub shrubs 0.1–1.5 m tall and form dense colonies. The succulent leaves are opposite and sessile. The small, white flowers of Batis maritima are self-incompatible and the morphology of the pollen indicate that the plant is wind pollinated.Seeds are 1.1 mm long and 0.8 mm wide and have an extreme low weight (0.5 mg/seed). They have a smooth, very dark and hard walled coating and an elongated lenticular shape. It has been reported that they have germinated after several months of floating in seawater.The primary root branches early in development and is unbranched until the shoot is 10 cm
