DSM-II
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) (latest edition: the DSM-5, published in 2013) is a publication for the classification of mental disorders using a common language and standard criteria. It is published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) and is used by clinicians, researchers, psychiatric drug regulation agencies, health insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, the legal system, and policy makers. The DSM evolved from systems for collecting census and psychiatric hospital statistics and from a United States Army manual. Revisions since its first publication in 1952 have incrementally added to the total number of mental disorders, and removed those no longer considered to be mental disorders. An alternate classification publication is also widely used. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is produced by the World Health Organization (WHO). It has broader scope than the DSM, covering overall health; chapter V covers mental and behavioural disorders. While the DSM is the most popular diagnostic system for mental disorders in the U.S., the ICD is used more widely in Europe and other parts of the world, giving it a far larger reach than the DSM. The DSM-IV-TR (4th. ed.) contains specific codes allowing comparisons between the DSM and the ICD
