Pink soon diverged into an entirely new system, but development at Apple was beset by problems. In 1992, the new AIM alliance spawned an Apple/IBM partnership corporation named Taligent Inc., with the purpose of bringing Pink to market. IBM positioned it as a layer on top of their own multiplatform operating system, Workplace OS, while Apple continued with its original plans to make an entirely new OS based on it. In 1994, Hewlett-Packard joined the partnership with a 15% stake. After years of goal-shifting delays, in 1995 Apple sold its share of the project back to IBM and Taligent as an operating system was canceled. HP also withdrew from the project.
