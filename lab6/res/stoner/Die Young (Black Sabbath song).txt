Die Young (Black Sabbath song)
"Die Young" is a single by British rock band Black Sabbath from their 1980 album, Heaven and Hell. It was performed live during all the 1980 and 1981 tours (Ronnie James Dio), and returned to the set for the tours of 1986 (Glenn Hughes, Ray Gillen) 1987 (Tony Martin), 1989 (Tony Martin), 1990 (Tony Martin), and 1992 (Ronnie James Dio). Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi customarily plays a lengthy instrumental introductory passage to the song when performing live, with heavy atmospheric keyboard backing. A live rendition can be heard on Live from Radio City Music Hall, recorded in 2007 by Heaven & Hell, a band formed of members of Black Sabbath from the Mob Rules- and Dehumanizer-era lineups. In honour of ex-Vio-Lence manager Debbie Abono and Ronnie James Dio's passing, Machine Head's Robb Flynn recorded and released, free, an online cover of Die Young. Abono managed Flynn and Machine Head guitarist Phil Demmel when they were members of the Vio-Lence. Track listing UK 7" single (Vertigo #SAB 3)A. "Die Young" B.
