Rezső Nyers (Hungarian: [ˈrɛʒøː ˈɲɛrʃ]; 21 March 1923 – 22 June 2018) was a Hungarian politician who served as Minister of Finance of Hungary from 1960 to 1962. For a few months in 1989, he was the country's last Communist leader. Political career Rezső Nyers was born on 21 March 1923 as the son of Rezső Nyers, Sr. (1898–1956), who served as the last mayor of Kispest. After it became part of Budapest in 1950, he subsequently continued his position as chairman of the council of the 19th district. His mother was weaver Julianna Nagy (1899–1973). Until 1944 Nyers worked as a printer. He joined the Social Democratic Party in 1940. In 1948, the SZDP was forced to merge with the Communists into the Hungarian Working People's Party (MDP)–which was essentially a renamed and enlarged Communist Party. Nyers served as substitute member of the merged party's Central Leadership. He became representative of the National Assembly of Hungary in 1948 (until 1953). He was appointed head of a department of the Ministry of Domestic Commerce. In this same year he started his studies at the Karl Marx University of Economic Sciences. In 1954 he was elected member of the Central Leadership.
