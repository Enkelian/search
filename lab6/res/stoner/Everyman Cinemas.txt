Everyman Cinemas
Everyman Media Group plc (known as Everyman Cinemas) is a cinema company in the United Kingdom. The company was founded in 2000, when entrepreneur Daniel Broch bought the original Everyman Cinema in Hampstead, London, which dated to 1933, which before then was a theatre. Broch led the growth of the company with the acquisition in 2008 of Screen Cinemas to add more locations. This coincided with Broch selling a majority stake in the enlarged company, though he remains a shareholder. Following the acquisition, the group has refurbished or plans to refurbish a number of cinemas. Those already refurbished include Walton, Belsize Park, Baker Street, and The Screen On The Green in Islington. Everyman's cinemas have one to five screens, a small number of which offer 3D. Everyman Cinemas offer a programme of films and special events, including the Metropolitan Opera from New York and the National Theatre (in selected cinemas), live Q&As, film festivals and seasons. The venues each feature a licensed bar, food, digital projection and surround sound technology.The group is extending its operating area and has opened cinemas in northern England. The first of these opened in Leeds in April 2013 as part of the Trinity Leeds development
