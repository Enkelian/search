Chromium(II) chloride
Chromium(II) chloride describes inorganic compounds with the formula CrCl2(H2O)n. The anhydrous solid is white when pure, however commercial samples are often grey or green; it is hygroscopic and readily dissolves in water to give bright blue air-sensitive solutions of the tetrahydrate Cr(H2O)4Cl2. Chromium(II) chloride has no commercial uses but is used on a laboratory-scale for the synthesis of other chromium complexes. Synthesis CrCl2 is produced by reducing chromium(III) chloride either with hydrogen at 500 °C: 2 CrCl3 + H2 → 2 CrCl2 + 2 HClor by electrolysis.Small scale preparations can use LiAlH4, Zinc or related reagents, to reduce CrCl3 4 CrCl3 + LiAlH4 → 4 CrCl2 + LiCl + AlCl3 + 2 H2 2 CrCl3 + Zn → 2 CrCl2 + ZnCl2CrCl2 can also be prepared by treating a solution of chromium(II) acetate with hydrogen chloride. Cr2(OAc)4 + 4 HCl → 2 CrCl2 + 4 AcOH Structure and properties Anhydrous CrCl2 is white however commercial samples are often grey or green. It crystallizes in the Pnnm space group, which is an orthorhombically distorted variant of the rutile structure; making it isostructural to calcium chloride. The Cr centres are octahedral, being distorted by the Jahn-Teller Effect. The hydrated derivative, CrCl2(H2O)4, forms
