Roine Stolt
Roine Stolt (born 5 September 1956 in Uppsala) is a Swedish guitarist, vocalist and composer. A major figure in Sweden's rock history, Stolt led two of his country's most successful progressive rock bands: Kaipa in the 1970s and The Flower Kings in the 1990s onward. Biography Stolt started his career in the late 1960s playing bass guitar in local rock bands. He switched to guitar in 1973 and in the brief sojourn with Allman Brothers-influenced Orexis. In 1974 he became the guitarist in Kaipa, a professional progressive rock band, he was 17 years old at that time, the group made three successful albums and toured more than 100 gigs a year, including national TV and radio performances in Scandinavia. In 1979 he left Kaipa to form his own group Fantasia and made two albums. The group split up in 1983 and Stolt started working as a solo and session musician, arranger and producer. It was at this point I felt I had really learned to master the guitar that my career as singer started on the 1985 album "Behind The Walls", which was a melodic and romantic album more in the style of Jackson Browne or Hall & Oates.
