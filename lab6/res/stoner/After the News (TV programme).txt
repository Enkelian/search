After the News (TV programme)
After the News is a live topical discussion programme on ITV in the United Kingdom. The show, which broadcasts every weeknight after ITV News at Ten, is hosted separately five nights a week by broadcasters Emma Barnett and Nick Ferrari, and features a range of high-profile guests from news, politics, and popular culture.The host is joined for the duration of the 35-minute programme by two guests with passionately-held and differing views for a lively and combative discussion on a range of stories and issues. Depending on the news agenda, the panel may be joined by an additional interviewee or contributor who is at the heart of a major news story, and the programme will make room for single interviews on particularly high-profile topics. Emma Barnett, who hosts her own show on BBC Radio 5 Live, presents every Tuesday and Friday night, while LBC radio host Nick fronts the show on Wednesdays and Thursdays. The pair alternate on Mondays. The programme is not shown in most of Scotland, due to the Scottish ITV licensee, STV, broadcasting their own late-night current affairs programme, Scotland Tonight, however viewers in Scotland can see the show if they have Sky TV, Freesat or Virgin Media,
