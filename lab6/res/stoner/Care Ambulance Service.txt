Care Ambulance Service
Care Ambulance Service provides ambulance transport and 9-1-1 response services providing basic life support and critical care for patients in Los Angeles, Riverside and Orange counties in California, United States. History Care was founded by Carl Richardson and Jack Dossett as a one-ambulance operation in 1969. The company continues to be operated by the Richardson family and is now run by Carl's sons, Dan and Rick. Care received national accreditation in 1993 from the Commission on Accreditation of Ambulance Services certifying that it exceeds the basic standards required for state licensing as an ambulance service. In 2011, Care Ambulance was acquired by Falck USA. Falck has the worldâ€™s largest international ambulance fleet, and is the third largest ambulance provider in the United States. In 2015, Care was awarded a contract to serve 12 new Orange County cities following a controversial bidding process that the Orange County Register called "long and troubled". Organization Care Ambulance is divided into three divisions, Orange County, Riverside County and Los Angeles County. The Orange County division is based out of the main headquarters in Orange, California, while the Los Angeles division is based in Santa Fe Springs. Care Ambulance has 12 substations in Orange County
