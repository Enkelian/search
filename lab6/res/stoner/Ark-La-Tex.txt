Ark-La-Tex
The Ark-La-Tex (a portmanteau of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas; also stylized as Arklatex or ArkLaTex) is a socio-economic tri-state region where the Southern U.S. states of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas abut. The region contains portions of Northwest Louisiana, Northeast Texas, and South Arkansas as well as the extreme southeastern tip of Oklahoma, partly centered upon the Red River, which flows along the Texas–Oklahoma state line into Southwestern Arkansas and Northwest Louisiana. The population estimate of the 47-county core region under the 2010 U.S. Census was 1,043,570 people. Shreveport, Louisiana, with approximately 189,149 people, is the largest city, the economic and geographic center of the region, and the principal hub for both the Shreveport–Bossier City metropolitan area and Northwestern Louisiana. Tyler, Texas, with an approximate population of 105,727 people, is the second-largest city as well as the center of the Tyler–Longview metroplex. The twin cities of Texarkana, Texas and Texarkana, Arkansas are the fourth and fifth largest cities, respectively, but collectively make up the region's third-largest metropolitan area (with a combined population over 150,100 residents) as the center of the Texarkana metropolitan area encompassing Miller County, Arkansas and Bowie County, Texas.
