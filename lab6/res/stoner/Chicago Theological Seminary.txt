Chicago Theological Seminary
The Chicago Theological Seminary (CTS) is a Christian ecumenical American seminary located in Chicago, Illinois, and is one of several seminaries historically affiliated with the United Church of Christ. It is the oldest institution of higher education in Chicago, originally established in 1855 under the direction of the abolitionist Stephen Peet and the Congregational Church (now the United Church of Christ) by charter of the Illinois legislature. In addition to being a seminary of the United Church of Christ, CTS offers students coursework necessary to be ordained by the Metropolitan Community Church denomination.

The seminary's preeminent religious activists and theologians among its faculty and alumni include Jesse Jackson, Sr., Stephen G. Ray Jr., Susan Brooks Thistlethwaite, Graham Taylor, Howard Schomer, G. Campbell Morgan, John W. de Gruchy, and Otis Moss III among others.
