Churches Church of England The Church of England parish church of Saint John the Baptist has existed since at least the 13th century, and its chancel arch dates from that time. The building has north and south aisles linked to the nave by 14th century arcades of three bays each. There used to be a bell tower over the north aisle. In 1844 the architects John Plowman and H.J. Underwood effected an almost complete rebuilding of St John's that included demolishing the old tower and replacing it with the current west tower. The church is a Grade II* listed building.The tower has a ring of eight bells, all from the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. Thomas II
