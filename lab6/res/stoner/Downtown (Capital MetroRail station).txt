Downtown (Capital MetroRail station)
Downtown (or Downtown-Convention Center) is a Capital MetroRail commuter rail station in Austin, Texas. It is located in Downtown Austin at the corner of Fourth and Neches Street behind the Austin Convention Center. It is the current southern terminus of the Red Line. It is also the smallest Capital MetroRail station. History Construction began in August 2008 and concluded in November of that year. On June 2, 2019, the Downtown station temporarily closed so that construction on an expanded station (three-track, two-platform) could commence; it was later reopened in early November of that year, but without Saturday service until the end of 2019. Construction on the new station is expected to take two years and cost $30 million dollars.
