Augustine Washington Jr.
Augustine Washington Jr. (1720â€“1762) was an American soldier, planter, politician, and member of the Washington family. He was the second and youngest son of Augustine Washington and Jane Butler, and George Washington's half-brother.Augustine Washington Jr. married Anne Aylett at "Nominy Plantation." She was the daughter and coheiress of William Aylett of Westmoreland County, Virginia. The couple had four children. According to the will of Augustine Washington Sr., the land now known as Mount Vernon first was willed to Lawrence Washington (brother of Augustine Jr.). However, the will instructed that in the case Lawrence should die without an heir the property would go to Augustine Jr. if he would be willing to give the Popes Creek property, known as "Wakefield", to George Washington. Augustine decided instead to keep the Popes Creek property and so George got the property now known as Mount Vernon. Augustine Jr. was a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses from Westmoreland County from 1754 to 1758. He also was a member of the Ohio Company.In 1753, he inherited his brother Lawrence's share in Accokeek Furnace near Stafford, Virginia. Notes References Tyler, Lyon Gardiner, ed.
