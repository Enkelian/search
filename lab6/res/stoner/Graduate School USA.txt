Graduate School USA
Graduate School USA, formerly the Graduate School, USDA, is a private school headquartered in Washington, DC, with regional campuses around the United States. It only offers training programs; it does not offer academic degree programs or for-credit courses. Its stated mission is to "develop people and to make government more efficient and effective by offering a wide variety of classes and programs, ranging from government-based specialties such as governmental accounting and auditing, human capital management and acquisition to foreign languages, economics, leadership and landscape design." It has approximately 200,000 participants per year with over 600 courses, including 300 evening and weekend courses. History The Graduate School was created in 1921 by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to provide adult continuing education. The Graduate School remained a part of the USDA as a Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentality (NAFI) until February 2009. At that time the school severed ties with the Department of Agriculture and became a private, nonprofit institution. Following the privatization, the school announced it would seek accreditation that would allow it to award bachelor’s and master’s degrees.Nearby Southeastern University began seeking proposals for a merger in summer 2008. Southeastern was facing financial difficulties and a possible loss of accreditation. In
