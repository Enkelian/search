It can be divided into the upper arm (sometimes called aftarm), which extends from the shoulder to the elbow, the forearm (also called antebrachium) which extends from the elbow to the hand, and the hand. Anatomically the shoulder girdle with bones and corresponding muscles is by definition a part of the arm. The Latin term brachium may refer to either the arm as a whole or to the upper arm on its own. The use of "antebrachium" to refer to forearm is in the sense of brachium just being the upper (aft) arm. Anatomy Bones The humerus is one of the three long bones of the arm. It joins with the scapula at the shoulder joint and with the other long bones of the arm, the ulna and radius at the elbow joint. The elbow is a complex hinge joint between the end of the humerus and the ends of the radius and ulna. Muscles The arm is divided by a fascial layer (known as lateral and medial intermuscular
