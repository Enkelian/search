Shahumyan Province
Shahumyan Province (Armenian: Շահումյան) is a province of the de facto Republic of Artsakh. The Republic has limited international recognition. It is de jure part of the Republic of Azerbaijan. Only the western part is under the de facto control of the Artsakh Defense Army. The eastern part (original district of Shahumyan), although claimed by the Artsakh Republic, is controlled by Azerbaijan. The southern part of Azerbaijan's Goranboy District along the ceasefire line contains that part of Shahumyan Province which is claimed by the Artsakh Republic. While the claimed part almost wholly lays outside the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast, it nevertheless had mainly Armenian population. Even though it was initially planned to be occupied as well, the Armenian and Artsakh forces failed to capture it during the Nagorno Karabakh War as the Azerbaijani forces enhanced their positions there in 1992. Shahumian Province has 16 communities of which 1 is considered urban and 16 are rural.
