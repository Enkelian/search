Paerisades III
Paerisades III (Greek: Παιρισάδης) was a son of Leukon II and Alkathoe, he also succeeded his brother Spartokos V as Spartocid king of the Bosporan Kingdom from 180 to 150 BC. Biography Early Reign Before his rule, the Bosporan Kingdom was under the archonship of Hygiainon, a supporter of the Spartocids and perhaps a regent for Kamasarye who was unmarried and could not rule. He was not directly in the line of succession, as he was the son of Spartokos V's brother, perhaps Spartokos IV. Paerisades then presumably succeeded Hygiainon in 200 BC or perhaps Spartokos V sometime in 180 BC, the correct succession being unknown. He then married his cousin, Kamasarye. They were praised by an assembly in Delphi due to Spartokos V's and Paerisades's actions towards foreigners that entered their kingdom. Kamasarye would be the mother of his eldest son Paerisades IV, who later succeed his father At some point during his reign, he may have taken another wife, possibly named Argotes, who was perhaps the mother of Paerisades V, the last Spartocid ruler of the Bosporan Kingdom. Succession Paerisades III was succeeded by his sons Paerisades IV "Philometor" (ca. 150-125 BC) and Paerisades V (ca. 125-108 BC).
