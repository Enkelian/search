Eye in the Sky (song)
"Eye in the Sky" is a 1982 song by the British rock band The Alan Parsons Project from the album Eye in the Sky. It hit No. 3 on the Billboard charts in the U.S. in October 1982, No. 1 in both Canada and Spain, and No. 6 in New Zealand and was their most successful release. The instrumental piece entitled "Sirius" segues into "Eye in the Sky"' on the original recording. In 2019, Alan Parsons recorded a version in Catalan of this song, under the title "Seré els teus ulls al camí" ("I'll be your eyes on the road"), for the CD edited by La Marató de TV3, a telethon devoted to raise funds for the research of incurable diseases. Overview The 1:54 minute instrumental piece entitled "Sirius" immediately precedes "Eye in the Sky"' on the original recording, which then segues into "Eye in the Sky". On the single release, "Eye in the Sky" appears on its own, with "Sirius" edited out; this is the version that was usually played on pop radio at the time. However, album-oriented rock and classic rock stations almost exclusively include the "Sirius" intro. Personnel Alan Parsons – Fairlight CMI, production, engineering, composer Eric
