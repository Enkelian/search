The Deviants (band)
The Deviants (formerly The Social Deviants) were an English rock group originally active in the late 1960s, but later used as a vehicle for the musical work of writer Mick Farren until his death in 2013. Farren has stated that The Deviants were originally a community band which "did things every now and thenâ€”it was a total assault thing with a great deal of inter-relation and interdependence". Musically, Farren described their sound as "teeth-grinding, psychedelic rock" somewhere between The Stooges and The Mothers of Invention. The Deviants have been described as a transition between classic British psych and the punk/heavy metal aesthetic of the 1970s. History 1960s The Social Deviants were founded by singer/writer Mick Farren in 1967 out of the Ladbroke Grove UK Underground community, featuring Pete Munro on bass; Clive Muldoon on guitar, Mike Robinson on guitar and a drummer called Benny (surname unknown) who was soon replaced by Russell Hunter (born Barry Russell Hunter, 26 April 1946, in Woking, Surrey). The band shortened their name to "The Deviants" after Munro and Muldoon left and were replaced by Sid Bishop on guitar (born Ian Bishop, 17 December 1946, Balham, South West London) and Cord Rees on bass.
