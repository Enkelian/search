San Agustín de la Isleta Mission
San Agustín de la Isleta Mission, founded in 1622, was a Spanish Mission in what is now Bernalillo County, New Mexico, United States. It was a religious outpost established by Spanish Catholic Franciscans, to spread Christianity among the local Native Americans. History Isleta Pueblo is the name of two pueblos of the ancient Tiwa (Spanish: Tigua) tribe, connected culturally and by language to other tribes of the Tanoan language family. Older historians thought they were related distantly to Shoshonean peoples. The San Agustin de la Isleta Mission was founded on the older pueblo, on the west bank of the Rio Grande about 13 miles (21 km) south of Albuquerque. The original Isleta (i.e. islet) was so named by the Spaniards from its position on a tongue of land projecting into the stream; the native name, Shiewhibak, seems to refer to a knife used in connection with a certain ceremonial foot race. The village was first entered by the Spanish conquistador Francisco Vásquez de Coronado in 1540. In 1582-3 Espejo (q.v.) visited the pueblo while trying to ascertain the fate of Father Rodriguez and two other Franciscan missionaries, who had been murdered a year earlier by native people in the vicinity.
