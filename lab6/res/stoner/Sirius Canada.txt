Sirius Canada
Sirius Canada was a Canadian company, a partnership between Slaight Communications, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and Sirius Satellite Radio, which was one of three services licensed by the CRTC on June 16, 2005 to introduce satellite radio service to Canada. On November 24, 2010, following the merger of Sirius Satellite Radio and XM Satellite Radio in the United States, Sirius Canada and XM Radio Canada announced their own merger deal, subject to approval by shareholders and the CRTC. The CRTC approved the merger in April 2011, and thus paved the way for both services to take the name SiriusXM Canada. The merger was subsequently completed on June 21, 2011.Canadian Satellite Radio, the former licensee of XM, will hold 30 per cent of the merged company, while Slaight Communications and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the owners of Sirius Canada, will each hold 20 per cent and the American Sirius XM Radio will hold 25 per cent. Mark Redmond, the president and CEO of Sirius Canada, will retain an executive role in the new merged company. Unlike XM Radio Canada, Sirius Canada was a private company, and was therefore not required to release quarterly financial result data. Subscription package The initial lineup
