Norwegian Meteorological Institute
The Norwegian Meteorological Institute (Norwegian: Meteorologisk institutt), also known internationally as MET Norway, is Norway's national meteorological institute. It provides weather forecasts for civilian and military uses and conducts research in meteorology, oceanography and climatology. It is headquartered in Oslo and has offices and stations in other cities and places. It has around 500 full-time staff and was founded in 1866. History The institute was founded in 1866 with the help of Norwegian astronomer and meteorologist Henrik Mohn who served as its director until 1913. He is credited with founding meteorological research in Norway. The abbreviation MET Oslo or MET OSLO has been used internationally for a long time; the World Meteorological Organization for example recommended in 1956 that its members standardized references to this institute as MET OSLO. Activities The institute has around 500 employees and some 650 part-time observers around the country. It also operated the last remaining weather ship in the world, MS Polarfront, stationed in the North Atlantic, until it was discontinued due to budgetary issues on 1 January 2010 and replaced with satellite and buoy data. The institute represents Norway in international organizations like the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
