Government Chief Scientific Adviser
The UK Government Chief Scientific Adviser (GCSA) is the personal adviser on science and technology-related activities and policies to the Prime Minister and the Cabinet; and head of the Government Office for Science. The Chief Scientific Adviser has a significant public role as the government's most visible scientific expert. They are also head of the Science and Engineering Profession in government. Most individual government departments have their own departmental Chief Scientific Adviser (CSA). The GCSA has no formal management responsibility for departmental CSAs and is free to provide advice to all departments, including those that have their own chief scientific adviser. The advisor also usually serves as chair of the UK’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE).
