Hello There
"Hello There" is a song written by Rick Nielsen and first released on Cheap Trick's 1977 album, In Color. The song was also often used as the first song of Cheap Trick concerts, and as a result was the first song on the band's seminal live album Cheap Trick at Budokan."Hello There" is a frantic, energetic, raucous hard rock song. As performed on In Color, the song starts with Nielsen playing a frenzied, fuzzy guitar part for two and a half bars, then Bun E. Carlos' strong drum beat appears, and finally Tom Petersson's bass and Robin Zander's vocal join in. The entire song lasts 1 minute and 41 seconds. Annie Zaleski of Ultimate Classic Rock described it as having "razor-edge riffs, a frenzied drum solo and ragged exhortations of "Would you like to do a number with me?" Cheap Trick also released the song on its compilation albums Sex, America, Cheap Trick and The Essential Cheap Trick. A live video of Cheap Trick performing "Hello There" at the Budokan concert was shown on the DVD included with the 30th anniversary collector's edition release of Cheap Trick at Budokan album.Critic Dave Marsh of Rolling Stone detected echoes in the song
