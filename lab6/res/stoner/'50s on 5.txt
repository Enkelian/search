'50s on 5
The '50s on 5 (or just The '50s) is a commercial-free, satellite radio station on Sirius XM Radio channel 5, as well as on Dish Network channel 6005. From 2001 to 2008, the Program Director for XM's The '50s on 5 was Ken Smith, and its Music Director was Matt "the Cat" Baldassarri. Both men were dismissed from the channel in October 2008 following XM's merger with former rival Sirius. On November 12, 2008, The '50s on 5 was added to the Sirius platform, replacing the Sirius Gold channel. Similar to the other decades-themed channels, The '50s on 5 attempts to recreate the feel of 1950s radio. It uses similar DJ habits, jingles, period slang, and news updates. The channel was also used for XM's annual Pop Music music chronology, IT. However, unlike most satellite radio stations which play songs solely from a specific decade, the lineup of songs on The '50s on 5 is mostly from 1954-1963. In early 2014, Sirius removed the disc jockeys from The '50s on 5, and also from '90s on 9, in an apparent cost-cutting move. Pat St. John was one of the dismissed DJs.
