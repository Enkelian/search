Socialism in Greece
Socialism in Greece has a significant history, with various activists, politicians and political parties identifying as socialist. Socialist movements in Greece began to form around the early 20th century, including the Communist Party of Greece (KKE) (1920-present), the Socialist Party of Greece (1920-1953) and the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK). Socialist ideology is present within the political party Syriza which forms the current opposition in Greece, also known as the Coalition of the Radical Left. History The Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) emerged in 1974 following the military dictatorship, with Andreas Papandreou as the partyâ€™s leader. PASOK established itself as a party that represented social and political change, differentiating itself from right-wing and the traditional left-wing parties. During this time, the political party New Democracy returned to governance, with Constantine Karamanlis as the Prime Minister from 1974 to 1980. In 1977, politics in Greece experienced a leftward shift, with PASOK gaining popularity and maintaining 25.2% of the vote and 93 seats in parliament.Proceeding the 1981 election, PASOK became the first left-wing socialist party in history to govern Greece, defeating New Democracy. The previous government under New Democracy experienced various economic and administrative complications leading to a general dissatisfaction amongst various social groups.
