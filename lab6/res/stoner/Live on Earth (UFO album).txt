Live on Earth (UFO album)
Live on Earth is a live recording (double CD) of the band UFO. It was recorded in Vienna, Austria in 1998 and features four-fifths of the reformed, classic line up of the band from the late 1970s with Simon Wright replacing Andy Parker on drums who had decided to run his family business rather than tour.Most of the set list is culled from their legendary live album Strangers in the Night with the inclusion of three songs from their last studio album Walk on Water and two older songs: "Electric Phase" and "One More for the Rodeo". The set list is identical to an earlier live album Werewolves of London except that Live on Earth includes "Shoot Shoot" as the final track. Tha album was issued also as a quadruple CD set, including performances at the Agora Ballroom in Cleveland, on July 1977 and at Bogart's in Cincinnati, on 21 August 1995.
