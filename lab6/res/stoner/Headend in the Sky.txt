Headend in the Sky
Managed Satellite Distribution (fka HITS) is Comcast's satellite multiplex service that provides cable channels to cable television operations. At a traditional cable television headend, multitudes of satellite dishes and antennas are used to grab cable stations from dozens of communication satellites. In contrast, Managed Satellite Distribution (fka HITS) combines cable stations into multiplex signals on just a few satellites; cable television companies can then pull in hundreds of channels at the local headend with relatively little equipment; the HITS feed effectively replaces the more complex traditional headend operations. Managed Satellite Distribution (fka HITS) was founded in 1994 and its namesake product is commonly recognized as the pioneer of digital television in the United States. Managed Satellite Distribution (fka HITS) was launched by TCI before their later 1999 purchase by the old AT&T, then merged with the smaller Comcast in 2002 as part their purchase of AT&T Broadband (formerly TCI). The Managed Satellite Distribution (fka HITS) headquarters in Centennial, Colorado, formerly known as the National Digital Television Center, is now called the Comcast Media Center. As of 2010, Managed Satellite Distribution (fka HITS) offers 6 standard-definition multiplexes on SES Americom's SES-1, 12 standard-definition multiplexes and 8 HD multiplexes on AMC-18, 1
