Sleep's Holy Mountain (also known as Holy Mountain) is the second studio album by the American band Sleep. It was released in November 1992 in Europe, and March 1993 in the USA through Earache Records. Release and reception The recordings that would become Sleep's Holy Mountain were originally sent to independent label Earache as a demo. The label immediately signed the band and released the recordings exactly as they were received. It was the last album to be released by the band as a fully functioning group for a while, as their subsequent albums up to 2018's The Sciences were released after the group had broken up.

The songs "Dragonaut" and "Some Grass" are used in the 1997 Harmony Korine film Gummo. In May 2009, the album was performed live in its entirety as part of the All Tomorrow's
