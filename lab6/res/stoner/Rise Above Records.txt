Rise Above Records
Rise Above Records is a London, England based independent record label owned by Lee Dorrian (of the band Cathedral and formerly of Napalm Death). Founding Lee Dorrian started Rise Above Records in 1988 without the intention of the label being an ongoing position. It was during the same year that he had left his previous band, Napalm Death. Dorrian explained that it was predominantly done to "get the dole off my back as they were asking a lot of questions as Napalm Death were on the front cover of the NME and on TV three times in one week, but I was still living in a council flat and couldn't even afford the rent."Rise Above Records was initially started up on the Enterprise Allowance Scheme, a Conservative government initiative which fronted cash to young entrepreneurs. Style Dorrian's initial intention was to release hardcore punk music and limited edition releases. The label was named after the Black Flag song of the same name. The first release from the label was a Napalm Death live EP (Extended play) followed by releases from bands such as S.O.B. and Long Cold Stare.Dorrian was a fan of bands such as Candlemass, Saint Vitus and Trouble
