Boxing the compass
The points of the compass are the vectors by which planet-based directions are conventionally defined. A compass rose is primarily composed of four cardinal directions—north, east, south, and west—each separated by 90 degrees, and secondarily divided by four ordinal (intercardinal) directions—northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest—each located halfway between two cardinal directions. Some disciplines such as meteorology and navigation further divide the compass with additional vectors. Within European tradition, a fully defined compass has 32 'points' (and any finer subdivisions are described in fractions of points).Compass points are valuable in that they allow a user to reference to a specific azimuth in a colloquial fashion, without having to compute or remember degrees. Compass points The names of the compass point directions follow these rules: 8-wind compass rose The four cardinal directions are north (N), east (E), south (S), west (W), at 90° angles on the compass rose. The four intercardinal (or ordinal) directions are formed by bisecting the angle of the cardinal directions: northeast (NE), southeast (SE), southwest (SW) and northwest (NW). In English and some other languages, but not all, the name of each intercardinal is simply a combination of the cardinals that it bisects; the sequence can vary by
