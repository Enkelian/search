Mandibular foramen
The mandibular foramen is an opening on the internal surface of the ramus of the mandible for divisions of the mandibular nerve and blood vessels to pass through. Structure The mandibular foramen is an opening on the internal surface of the ramus of the mandible for divisions of the mandibular nerve and blood vessels to pass through. Variation There are two distinct anatomies to its rim. In the common form the rim is “V” shaped, with a groove separating the anterior and posterior parts. In the horizontal-oval form there is no groove, and the rim is horizontally oriented and oval in shape, the anterior and posterior parts connected.Rarely, a bifid inferior alveolar nerve may be present, in which case a second mandibular foramen, more inferiorly placed, exists and can be detected by noting a doubled mandibular canal on a radiograph. Function The mandibular nerve is one of three branches of the trigeminal nerve, and the only one having motor innervation. One branch of it, the inferior alveolar nerve as well as the inferior alveolar artery enter the foramen traveling through the body in the mandibular canal and exit at the mental foramen on the anterior mandible at which point the
