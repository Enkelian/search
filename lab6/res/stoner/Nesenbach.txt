Nesenbach
The Nesenbach is a stream in Stuttgart, the capital of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, Germany, a tributary of the Neckar. It has its source in the city's southwestern district of Vaihingen. After 12.8 kilometres, it discharges into the Neckar in the east of Stuttgart, opposite Bad Cannstatt. Probably due to the protecting effect of its narrow vale, the development of the large city of Stuttgart was possible despite its otherwise disadvantageous topography. == References ==
