Charles V. Park Library
Charles V. Park Library is the main library of Central Michigan University, named after librarian Charles V. Park. It is located in Mount Pleasant, Michigan. The Clarke Historical Library is located within the library as well. History The library was built in 1968 and opened to students in 1969. The 173,500-square-foot (16,120 m2) structure was about three times as large as the former library located in Ronan Hall and cost $4.2 million to erect. As the building of the library was helped by a federal grant, the original cornerstone of the library contained Richard Nixon's inaugural address and a report on the war in Vietnam written by Secretary of State Dean Rusk. The library was expanded and renovated at a cost of $50 million and reopened to the public in 2002. Architects for the expansion project were URS, Inc. and Indianapolis-based Woollen, Molzan and Partners.
