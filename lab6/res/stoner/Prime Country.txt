Prime Country
Prime Country is a 1980s and 1990s country radio channel on Sirius XM Radio channel 58 and DISH Network channel 6058. It is also available on the SiriusXM app for tablets and smart phones, and online. The channel highlights hit country music from the 1980s and 1990s, and will occasionally play 1970's songs. Since the creation of the Y2Kountry channel (61), Prime Country plays far fewer songs from the first decade of the 2000s. Every December, SiriusXM puts its "Country Christmas" format on Channel 58, leaving Prime Country as an internet-only channel without hosts. "Country Christmas" is heard both on the app and in vehicles on the channel. Host Charlie Monk's "Andy & Opie Christmas" is a popular spoken-work performance heard on the channel. Featured artists Prime Country will regularly play the same artists hour-after-hour, such as George Strait, Garth Brooks, Reba McEntire, Brooks & Dunn, Alan Jackson, Vince Gill, Travis Tritt, Shania Twain, John Michael Montgomery, Restless Heart, Alabama, Lonestar, Randy Travis, Dolly Parton, Trisha Yearwood, LeAnn Rimes, Clint Black, John Anderson, Tracy Lawrence, Kenny Rogers, and many more.
