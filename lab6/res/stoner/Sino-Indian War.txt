Sino-Indian War
The Sino-Indian War, also known as the Indo-China War and Sino-Indian Border Conflict, was a war between China and India that occurred in 1962. A disputed Himalayan border was the main cause of the war, but other issues had also played a role. There had been a series of violent border skirmishes between the two countries after the 1959 Tibetan uprising, when India granted asylum to the Dalai Lama. India initiated a Forward Policy in which it placed outposts along the border, including several north of the McMahon Line, the eastern portion of the Line of Actual Control proclaimed by Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai in 1959. Unable to reach political accommodation on disputed territory along the 3,225 kilometre- (2,000 mile-) long Himalayan border, China launched simultaneous offensives in Ladakh and across the McMahon Line on 20 October 1962. Chinese troops outmatched Indian forces in both theatres, capturing Rezang La in Chushul in the western theatre, as well as Tawang in the eastern theatre. The war ended when China declared a ceasefire on 21 November 1962, and simultaneously announced its withdrawal to its claimed 'Line of Actual Control'. Much of the fighting took place in harsh mountain conditions, entailing large-scale combat
