Martuni Province
Martuni Province (Armenian: Մարտունի) is a province of the de facto Republic of Artsakh. The Republic has limited international recognition. It is de jure part of the Republic of Azerbaijan. The territory was formed from the Soviet-era raion of Martuni District within the former Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast. The eastern part of that District in under the de facto control of the Republic of Azerbaijan. The territory of the province is considered by Azerbaijan to be a de jure part of the wider district of Khojavend. Martuni Province consists of the branch of the former Oblast which juts out farthest to the east, almost reaches Stepanakert on the west, and goes a little past Karmir Shuka on the south. The western half has many hills and small mountains, full of small villages, while the eastern half is very flat, with fewer villages, and the larger regional center of Martuni. Historically, this area was also known as Myus Haband and Varand. Martuni Province has 35 rural communities and 1 urban community. In 1991 the parliament of Azerbaijan, with the Law on Abolishment of Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast, abolished Martuni District, incorporating its territory into the neighbouring Azerbaijani Khojavend District.
