The specific epithet aethiopicum in this sense was the Latin term for Africa south of the then known world, that is to say, more or less Africa south of Egypt. In South Africa the species occurs widely, though not generally profusely, mainly on moist sandstone cliffs in full shade. In the Cape Peninsula it is uncommon and grows mainly at the highest locally available altitudes, generally about 600–1,085 m (2,000–3,600 ft).Adiantum aethiopicum grows in spreading clumps of fronds from 10 to 45 cm (4 to 18 in) in height. The rhizomes are wiry and branched. The fronds are horizontal and layered, or upright.
