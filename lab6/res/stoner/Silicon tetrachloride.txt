Silicon tetrachloride
Silicon tetrachloride or tetrachlorosilane is the inorganic compound with the formula SiCl4. It is a colourless volatile liquid that fumes in air. It is used to produce high purity silicon and silica for commercial applications. Preparation Silicon tetrachloride is prepared by the chlorination of various silicon compounds such as ferrosilicon, silicon carbide, or mixtures of silicon dioxide and carbon. The ferrosilicon route is most common.In the laboratory, SiCl4 can be prepared by treating silicon with chlorine: Si + 2 Cl2 → SiCl4It was first prepared by Jöns Jakob Berzelius in 1823. Brine can be contaminated with silica when the production of chlorine is a byproduct of a metal refining process from metal chloride ore. In rare occurrences, the silicon dioxide in silica is converted to silicon tetrachloride when the contaminated brine is electrolyzed. Reactions Hydrolysis and related reactions Like other chlorosilanes, silicon tetrachloride reacts readily with water: SiCl4 + 2 H2O → SiO2 + 4 HClIn contrast, carbon tetrachloride does not hydrolyze readily. The reaction can be noticed on exposure of the liquid to air, the vapour produces fumes as it reacts with moisture to give a cloud-like aerosol of hydrochloric acid.With alcohols and ethanol it reacts to give tetramethyl
