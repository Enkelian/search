Party All the Time
"Party All the Time" is a 1985 single by comedian and actor Eddie Murphy, written and produced by Rick James. It was the lead single from Murphy's debut musical album How Could It Be. The single was recorded at James' home studio in Buffalo, New York. It reached #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 for three weeks, behind "Say You, Say Me" by Lionel Richie. Rick James also provided vocals for the song. The lyrics are a lament by the singer that despite the expensive, extravagant things he lavishes on his girlfriend, she much prefers spending time going out clubbing, dancing, partying, as well as flirting and cheating with other men, rather than being with her boyfriend and remaining faithful to him. Reception Barbara Bryson of Los Angeles Times criticized the song, characterizing it as "Gumby goes disco" (referring to the character parodied by Murphy on Saturday Night Live). The publication also placed the song at #1 on "The Video Bottom 10" list.
