Tropical rock
Tropical rock (also known as trop rock or Gulf & Western) is a genre of popular music that incorporates elements and influences of rock, reggae, country, folk, calypso, zydeco, and pop music, with themes and musical compositions inspired by an island style.Although today tropical rock is usually associated with southern Florida and the Gulf Coast of the United States, trop rock has its roots in calypso, rock, and country by artists such as Jerry Jeff Walker.
