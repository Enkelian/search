Leaf Hound Records is a Japanese record label specializing in 1960s and 1970s inspired stoner/doom metal. The label takes its name from the 1970s hard rock band Leaf Hound. Leaf Hound Records has released material from Japanese bands such as Church of Misery and Sonic Flower, US bands such as Blood Farmers and Acid King and European bands such as Orange Sunshine and Acrimony.

These reissues include Revelation's Never Comes Silence, Iron Man's Black Night and The Passage, and the Blood Farmers self-titled album. They have also reissued two other Revelation albums, Salvation's Answer (originally on Rise Above Records) and an unreleased album, and have also announced plans to issue Revelation's fourth album, Release. They have begun releasing Japanese versions of Rise Above Records releases, such as Witchcraft's third album, The Alchemist, and Electric Wizard's Witchcult Today, along with lesser known releases such as Gentlemans Pistols and Winters. They have also released Japanese versions of Witchcraft's previous two albums, Witchcraft and Firewood in 2008.
