Evil Empire speech
The "Evil Empire" speech was a speech delivered by U.S. President Ronald Reagan to the National Association of Evangelicals in 1983 during the Cold War. In that speech, Reagan referred to the Soviet Union as an "evil empire" and as "the focus of evil in the modern world". Reagan explicitly rejected the notion that the United States and the Soviet Union were equally responsible for the ongoing nuclear arms race between the two nations; rather, he asserted that the conflict was a battle between good and evil.

Some sources refer to the June 1982 speech before the British House of Commons as the "Evil Empire" speech, but while Reagan referred twice to totalitarianism in his London speech, the exact phrase "evil empire" was not included.

Bolshevik revolutionary Leon Trotsky used a similar phrase in November 1917, asserting that the Mensheviks belonged in the "dustbin of history". Speech Reagan's March 8,
