Salon (website)
Salon is an American liberal news and opinion website, created by David Talbot in 1995. It publishes articles on U.S. politics, culture, and current events and originally had a politically progressive/liberal editorial stance. In recent years, it has become more of a tabloid and not true to its original progressive ideals. Many previous writers have left for Slate. Content and coverage Salon covers a variety of topics, including reviews and articles about books, films, and music; articles about "modern life", including friendships, human sexual behavior, and relationships; and reviews and articles about technology, with a particular focus on the free and open-source software (FOSS) movement. According to the senior contributing writer for the American Journalism Review, Paul Farhi, Salon offers "provocative (if predictably liberal) political commentary and lots of sex."In 2008, Salon launched the interactive initiative Open Salon, a social content site/blog network for its readers. Originally a curated site with some of its content being featured on Salon, it fell into editorial neglect and was closed in March 2015.Responding to the question, "How far do you go with the tabloid sensibility to get readers?," former Salon.com editor-in-chief David Talbot said: Is Salon more tabloid-like? Yeah, we've made no secret
