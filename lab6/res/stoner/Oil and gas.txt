Oil and gas
A fossil fuel is a fuel formed by natural processes, such as anaerobic decomposition of buried dead organisms, containing energy originating in ancient photosynthesis. Such organisms and their resulting fossil fuels typically have an age of millions of years, and sometimes more than 650 million years. Fossil fuels contain high percentages of carbon and include petroleum, coal, and natural gas. Commonly used derivatives of fossil fuels include kerosene and propane. Fossil fuels range from volatile materials with low carbon-to-hydrogen ratios (like methane), to liquids (like petroleum), to nonvolatile materials composed of almost pure carbon, like anthracite coal. Methane can be found in hydrocarbon fields either alone, associated with oil, or in the form of methane clathrates. As of 2018, the world's primary energy sources consisted of petroleum (34%), coal (27%), natural gas (24%), amounting to an 85% share for fossil fuels in primary energy-consumption in the world. Non-fossil sources included nuclear (4.4%), hydroelectric (6.8%), and other renewables (4.0%, including geothermal, solar, tidal, wind, wood, waste). According to another source, world renewable energy-consumption was 18% in 2018. When compared with the previous year, world energy-consumption grew at a rate of 2.9%, almost double its 10-year average of 1.5% per year, and
