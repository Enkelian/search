University of California Libraries
The University of California operates the largest academic library system in the world. It manages more than 34 million items in 100 libraries on ten campuses. The purpose of these libraries is to assist research and instruction on the University of California campuses. While each campus library is separate, they share (through the UC library system) facilities for storage, computerized indexing, digital libraries and management. For example, each campus maintains its own computerized library catalog and simultaneously participates in the systemwide union catalog, MELVYL. The UC libraries also manage a digital library, the California Digital Library or CDL. They also hold special collections and electronic archives of research documents. Special collections include historical archives on California history, federal depositories, law libraries, specialized collections for medical and scientific research, and a series of periodicals. A major concern of the library system is the rising cost of scientific journal subscriptions, and the costs of renting article databases. The library is leading an effort to publish science research online in a persistently-available electronic format, primarily through a digital repository called the eScholarship repository. The physical collections are scattered across the UC campuses. Their collections and stand-alone library buildings are listed below. In the
