Viking rock
Viking rock (also known as Vikingarock in Swedish) is a rock music genre that takes much of its themes from 19th-century Viking romanticism, mixing it with elements of rockabilly, Oi! or street punk, and folk music. Frequent themes occurring in Viking rock include vikings and Norse mythology, as well as Sweden's King Karl XII and the Caroleans. Viking rock is often linked to white supremacy. Many make no distinction between Viking rock and white power music, and there is debate whether Viking rock is essentially racist. However, many Viking rock artists, such as the bands Hel and Kraftheim, completely disapprove of racism.Kuggn√§sfestivalen is a music festival that caters to viking rock.
