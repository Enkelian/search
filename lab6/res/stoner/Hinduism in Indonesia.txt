Hinduism in Indonesia
Hinduism in Indonesia, as of the 2010 census, is practised by about 1.7% of the total population, and by more than 83% of the population in Bali. Hinduism is one of the six official religions of Indonesia. Hinduism came to Indonesia in the 1st-century through traders, sailors, scholars and priests. A syncretic fusion of pre-existing Javanese culture and Hindu ideas, that from the 6th-century synthesized Buddhist ideas as well, evolved as the Indonesian version of Hinduism. These ideas continued to develop during the Srivijaya and Majapahit empires. About 1400 CE, these kingdoms were introduced to Islam from coast-based Muslim traders, and thereafter Hinduism mostly vanished from many of the islands of Indonesia.In 2010, the Ministry of Religious Affairs of the Government of Indonesia estimated that about 10 million Hindus lived on Indonesian islands, in contrast to the 2010 Indonesian official decadal census of over 4 million. The Parisada Hindu Dharma Indonesia disputed the decadal census methodology, and estimated 18 million Hindus lived in Indonesia in 2005.The Bali island in Indonesia has a Hindu majority and the largest number of Hindus living in Indonesia. History The natives of Indonesian Archipelago practiced indigenous animism and dynamism, beliefs common to the Austronesian people.
