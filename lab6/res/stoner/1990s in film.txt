1990s in film
The decade of the 1990s in film involved many significant developments in cinema. Continuing from the 1980s, low-budget independent films unceasingly rose and maintained their popularity in the industry within the decade. Events Thousands of full-length films were produced during the 1990s. Many were specifically filmed or edited to be displayed both on theater screens as well as on the smaller TV screens, such as showing close-up scenes during dialog, rather than just wide-angle scenes in a room. The home-video market became a major factor in total revenue for a film, often doubling its total income. The 1990s were notable in both the rise of independent cinema – as well as independent studios such as Miramax, Lions Gate, and New Line – and the advancements in CGI-technology, seen in such films as Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Jurassic Park, and Forrest Gump. Toy Story (1995) became the first feature length film to be completely computer animated, heralding its use as a tool for filmmakers to achieve new visuals for film. The Disney Renaissance began in late 1989 with The Little Mermaid, reached its peak in popularity with The Lion King in 1994, and ended in 1999 with Tarzan. 1988's Die Hard
