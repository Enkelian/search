Golden Lies
Golden Lies is a 2000 album by the Meat Puppets. After the You Love Me EP, in 1999, this was the second (and final) studio release from the second line-up of the Meat Puppets. Reception Al Shipley of Pitchfork was largely dismissive of the record, describing the album as settling "into a series of unremarkable mid-tempo hard rock tunes", describing the song "Hercules" in particular to be "clear sign that something is terribly wrong".
