1992 San Diego Chargers season
The 1992 San Diego Chargers season was the team's 33rd season, their 32nd in San Diego, and 23rd in the National Football League. The Chargers began with the team trying to improve on their 4–12 record in 1991. Bobby Ross began his first season as the team's head coach, after having spent the previous five years as a college coach at Georgia Tech. The team made the playoffs for the first time in ten years. The Chargers would lose their first four games of the season, but would rally to an 11–5 finish to the season, clinching the AFC West title, and becoming the first (and to this day, only) NFL team to start 0–4 and still make the playoffs.
