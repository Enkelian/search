Castleknock College
Castleknock College (Irish: Coláiste Caisleán Cnucha) is a voluntary Vincentian secondary school for boys, situated in the residential suburb of Castleknock, 8 km west of Dublin city centre, Ireland. Founded in 1835 by Fr. Philip Dowley CM, it is one of the oldest boys schools in Ireland. Although priority is given to those of the main Catholic tradition, as a Christian school, it is attended by students of other denominations and faiths. The school's colours are navy and sky blue. The school crest is a book, symbolising education, a cross, symbolising the success of Catholicism and the Irish shamrock, symbolising the success of the Vincentians in Ireland. The school has a conservative, intellectual, and Vincentian ethos.
