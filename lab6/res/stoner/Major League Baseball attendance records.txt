Major League Baseball attendance records
== Most attended pre-season game in history == 115,301 is the all-time record. It was a preseason game between the defending champions Boston Red Sox and Los Angeles Dodgers on Saturday March 29, 2008 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Least attended game in history Zero spectators attended a game between the Baltimore Orioles and the Chicago White Sox on April 29, 2015, at Oriole Park at Camden Yards; the game was played behind closed doors due to safety concerns surrounding the 2015 Baltimore protests.The record was previously held by a September 28, 1882, game between the Troy Trojans and the Worcesters in Worcester, Massachusetts, which some reports had only six spectators attend. As both clubs had been notified that they were being dropped from the National League, fans had very little interest in watching the lame-duck teams, especially on a day which the Boston Globe of September 29 (p.2) described as "bleak, cold and windy." Highest season home totals, by team The highest per game attendance average is held by the Colorado Rockies in 1994 with 57,570 for 57 home games at Mile High Stadium during the strike shortened season. 4 million or more home attendance totals Toronto Blue
