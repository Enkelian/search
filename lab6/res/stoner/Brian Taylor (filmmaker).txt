Brian Taylor (filmmaker)
Brian Taylor is an American film director, screenwriter, camera operator, and producer. He is best known for collaborating with Mark Neveldine in the writing/directing team Neveldine/Taylor. Career Taylor attended the Los Angeles Film School in Hollywood and began his career as a cinematographer, working on independent films and low-budget shorts. In the early 2000s, Taylor united with Mark Neveldine to form the directing team Neveldine/Taylor. Known for their aggressive, high energy camerawork, the team signed with @radical.media in 2004 as commercial directors. They shot campaigns for Nike, Powerade, Budweiser and many others before moving to the big screen in 2006 with their first feature, Crank. According to Taylor, the high adrenaline Crank was written as "an attack on studio filmmaking." The film spawned a sequel, Crank: High Voltage (2009) that Quentin Tarantino called “The Gremlins 2 of action movies.” The team pioneered the RED ONE camera on the dystopian science fiction mashup Gamer (2009), then trekked across Europe with Nicolas Cage on Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance (2011). In February 2012, Taylor signed a seven-figure deal with Sony Pictures to write and direct a film adaptation of the Twisted Metal video game series. The film has not yet been produced.
