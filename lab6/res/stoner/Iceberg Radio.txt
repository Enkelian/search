It has since moved to the Astral Media family.Originally, Slaight also programmed an adult album alternative channel on Sirius Satellite Radio channel 85, branded as Iceberg 85. The channel originally aired on Sirius 95, but moved to 85 in early June 2008. The Iceberg Radio site now redirects to an American service, AccuRadio. == References ==
