"Spiderwebs" is a song by American band No Doubt for their third studio album, Tragic Kingdom (1995). It was written by Gwen Stefani and Tony Kanal, produced by Matthew Wilder, and released as the album's second single on November 19, 1995. "Spiderwebs" appears on their 2003 greatest hits album, The Singles 1992â€“2003. Stefani was inspired to write the song after an admirer recited bad poetry to her. "Spiderwebs" is a new wave and pop punk song with angsty lyrics responding to Stefani's potential suitors. "Spiderwebs" received positive reviews from contemporary as well as past critics, who frequently called it as one of the defining songs for No Doubt. "Spiderwebs" was not released as a commercial single in the United States, and therefore was ineligible to enter the Billboard Hot 100 chart at the time of its release. However, it reached number 18 on the Hot 100 Airplay chart. The song failed to attain top-ten positions, but charted within the top 40 in Canada, New Zealand, Scotland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The music video for "Spiderwebs" was directed by Marcus Nispel and released on April 17, 1996. It features No Doubt performing the song at a Japanese wedding reception. Following
