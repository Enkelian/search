Disneyland Park (Paris)
Disneyland Park, originally Euro Disneyland Park, is a theme park found at Disneyland Paris in Marne-la-Vall√©e, France. The park opened on 12 April 1992 as the first of the two parks built at the resort. Designed and built by Walt Disney Imagineering, its layout is similar to Disneyland Park in California and Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World in Florida. Spanning 56.656 ha (140 acres) (the second largest Disney park based on the original, after Shanghai Disneyland Park), it is dedicated to fairy tales and Disney characters. In 2016, the park hosted approximately 8.4 million visitors, making it the most-visited theme park in Europe, and the 13th-most visited theme park in the world. The park is represented by Sleeping Beauty Castle, a replica of the fairy tale castle seen in Disney's 1959 animated film Sleeping Beauty. History In order to make things more distinct and not be a mere copy of the original, modifications were made to the park's concepts and designs. Among the changes was the change of Tomorrowland to Discoveryland, giving the area a retrofuturistic theme. Other altered elements include the Haunted Mansion, which was redesigned as Phantom Manor and a retro, more intense version of Space Mountain
