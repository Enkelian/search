Island Line Trail
The Island Line Trail is a 14-mile (23 km) rail trail located in northwest Vermont. It comprises the Burlington Bike Path (Burlington), Colchester Park (Colchester) and the Allen Point Access Area (South Hero). The trail follows the route of the Island Line railroad, built by the Rutland Railroad in 1901. The history of the Rutland Railroad is covered in Robert C. Jones "Railroads of Vermont, Volume 2" (ISBN 9781881535027), and in James Shaughnessy's "The Rutland Railroad", Howell North Books 1964. Passenger service on the Rutland's Island Line (and on the entire Rutland RR system) ended after a strike by employees in late June 1953. A second set of strikes in 1960 and 1961 brought about the complete closure of the Rutland Railroad. The final trains ran on September 25, 1961. In 1963 the state of Vermont purchased the abandoned, but not torn-up, Rutland Railroad lines from Burlington to Rutland, Bennington, Hoosic Junction and Bellows Falls, leasing them to the Vermont Railway and the Green Mountain Railway to resume freight service, but the state chose not acquire and reopen the Island Line. There was little on-line traffic left on that portion of the route and freight for Canada could be routed
