Benzylmorphine
Benzylmorphine (Peronine) is a semi-synthetic opioid narcotic introduced to the international market in 1896 and that of the United States very shortly thereafter. It is much like codeine, containing a benzyl group attached to the morphine molecule just as the methyl group creates codeine and the ethyl group creates ethylmorphine or dionine (used as a generic name for that drug just as peronine is for benzylmorphine). It is about 90% as strong as codeine by weight. This drug, the benzyl ether of morphine, should not be confused with dibenzoylmorphine, an ester of morphine comparable to heroin. Another morphine ether developed around the same time, benzyldihydromorphine, saw some clinical use in the opening years of the 20th Century. The ethers of morphine and codeine as well as dihydromorphine and dihydrocodeine number close to 100 and include such obscure opioids as formylallopseudoisocodeine. Benzylmorphine is used in much the same way as codeine and ethylmorphine, primarily as a moderate strength analgesic, for eye surgery as a 1 to 2% solution, and as a cough suppressant. It was available in the United States prior to 1914 and was still used until the 1960s, but fell into disuse once alternative opiate derivatives became preferred by
