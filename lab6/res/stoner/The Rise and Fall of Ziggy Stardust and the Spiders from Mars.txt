The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars
The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (often shortened to Ziggy Stardust) is the fifth studio album by English musician David Bowie, released on 16 June 1972 in the United Kingdom by RCA Records. It was produced by Bowie and Ken Scott and features contributions from Bowie's backing band the Spiders from Mars â€“ comprising Mick Ronson, Trevor Bolder and Mick Woodmansey. The album was recorded at Trident Studios in London like his previous album Hunky Dory. Most of the album was recorded in November 1971 with further sessions in January and early February 1972. Described as a rock opera and also a loose concept album, The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars is about Bowie's titular alter ego Ziggy Stardust, a fictional androgynous bisexual rock star who acts as a messenger for extraterrestrial beings. The album, and the character of Ziggy Stardust, were influenced by glam rock and explored themes of sexual exploration and social taboos. The character was retained for the subsequent Ziggy Stardust Tour through the United Kingdom, Japan and North America. A concert film of the same name, directed by D. A. Pennebaker, was recorded in
