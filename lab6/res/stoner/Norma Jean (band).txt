Norma Jean (band)
Norma Jean (formerly known as Luti-Kriss) is an American metalcore band from Douglasville, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta. Since their inception in 1997, numerous line up changes have left the band with no original members. To date, Norma Jean has released eight studio albums and received a Grammy Award nomination in 2006 for Best Recording Package for their second album O God, the Aftermath. The band's name is derived from the real name of actress Marilyn Monroe. History Luti-Kriss and debut album (1997â€“2004) Norma Jean formed in 1997 under the name Luti-Kriss with Josh Scogin on vocals, guitarists Scottie Henry and Chris Day, Josh Swafford on bass, Mick Bailey on turntables, and Daniel Davison on drums. The band recorded a split EP with Travail that was released in 1999 through Pluto Records. Luti-Kriss's songs from the split would later be released on 5ep, which was released on July 25, 2000 through Pluto Records. The sound of theses EPs differed greatly from future releases, featuring an aggressive nu metal and rap metal style. Shortly after the release of 5ep, Swafford would leave the band and be replaced by Josh Doolittle. The band then would start working on the debut album Throwing
