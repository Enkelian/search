Llandow Circuit
Llandow Circuit is a small, family owned and run motorsport circuit at Llandow, Vale of Glamorgan, 15 miles (24 km) south west of Cardiff, Wales, used mainly for supercar experience days, testing, track-days and events. The lap record is held by Martin Jessopp at 41.4 seconds - set on September 16, 2009 on his Ducati 1198RS British Superbike. Jessopp wasn't aware of a record or that he was being timed, and his Ducati was still running long gearing for the North West 200 a week prior, where Jessopp hit 208 mph a top speed record, not exactly ideal for Llandow. Llandow Kart Circuit, run by South Wales Karting Centre, is adjacent to the main circuit. History Llandow Circuit began life as an airfield during World War II. RAF Llandow was home to Supermarine Spitfires and part of the Royal Canadian Air Force, but the Air Ministry decommissioned it in 1957. In 1961 Jack Evans, a local farmer, bought an 80-acre parcel which included air raid shelters, gun turrets and stretches of runway. With the help of the South Wales Automobile Club he linked the runways to form a 1-mile oval track which was opened by Graham Hill in 1963. Car
