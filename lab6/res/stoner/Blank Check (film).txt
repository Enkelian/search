Plot On a rainy night, convicted bank robber Carl Quigley escapes from prison, and heads to a warehouse to recover a hidden safe box containing $1 million, which he hid there sometime before his arrest. The film cuts to unhappy 6th grader boy Preston Waters, whose father works as an investor and is very frugal with money. When invited to classmate Butch's birthday party at an amusement park, Preston is not excited because Butch acts like a bully, and Preston can only afford the cheap rides. Preston also feels his parents favor his older brothers over him. Quigley visits bank president Edward Biderman in his office to discuss his plan. As the stolen money was consecutive and traceable, Biderman is to exchange the marked bills for unmarked. Quigley explains that his assistant, Juice, will be stopping by Biderman's office with a check to be cashed for $1 million the next day.
