Hellenistic fortifications
Hellenistic fortifications are defense structures constructed during the Hellenistic Period of ancient Greek civilization (323 - ca. 30 B.C.E.). These included fortification walls, towers, and gates. Expansion of Greek territory during the Hellenistic Period from Alexander the Great's conquests created the necessity to build new fortifications with new settlements. This, combined with developing military technology, led to changes in style of architecture specific to the Hellenistic Period. Historical Chronology The Hellenistic Period was the period in Ancient Greek civilization from 323 - ca. 30 B.C.E.. It is marked by the death of Alexander the Great and ends with the rise of the Roman Empire. The period follows the conquests of Alexander the Great spreading Greek territory far into Egypt, Asia Minor, and the Middle East. The Hellenistic Period saw Greek territorial expansion at its greatest. Acquisition of new territory led to the movement of Greek people and influence throughout the Mediterranean. It also allowed for the rise of new cities. With a huge territory, being "Greek" became less of a geographic locator, and more a representation of personal cultural ties. Therefore architecture built during this time developed both a mix of canonical Greek elements and locally indigenous styles. Fortification walls
