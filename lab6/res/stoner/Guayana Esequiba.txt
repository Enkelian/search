Guayana Esequiba
Guayana Esequiba (Spanish pronunciation: [ɡwaˈʝana eseˈkiβa] (listen)) is a disputed territory of 159,500 km2 (61,600 sq mi) west of the Essequibo River that is administered and controlled by Guyana but claimed by Venezuela. The boundary dispute was inherited from the colonial powers (Spain in the case of Venezuela, and the Netherlands and the United Kingdom in the case of Guyana) and is complicated by the independence of Guyana from the United Kingdom in 1966. The status of the territory is subject to the Geneva Agreement, which was signed by the United Kingdom, Venezuela and British Guiana on 17 February 1966. This treaty stipulates that the parties will agree to find a practical, peaceful and satisfactory solution to the dispute. Despite the treaty, Venezuela has used diplomatic, economic and military actions against Guyana, such as threatening economic sanctions against nations seeking to assist Guyana developing the territory. Loss of the resource rich area, which constitutes about two-thirds of Guyana's territory, would do irreversible damage to the economic development of Guyana.The territory is divided by Guyana into six administrative regions: Barima-Waini, Cuyuni-Mazaruni, Pomeroon-Supenaam, Potaro-Siparuni, Upper Takutu-Upper Essequibo and Essequibo Islands-West Demerara. Venezuela treats it as a single entity Guayana Esequiba or Zone
