NCAA Men's Division I Outdoor Track and Field Championships
The NCAA Division I Men's Outdoor Track and Field Championship is an annual collegiate outdoor track and field competition for men organised by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Athlete's individual performances earn points for their institution and the team with the most points receives the NCAA team title in track and field. A separate NCAA Division I women's competition is also held. These two events are separate from the NCAA Division I Men's Indoor Track and Field Championships and NCAA Division I Women's Indoor Track and Field Championships held during the winter. The first edition of the championship was held in 1921 and the competition expanded to two divisions in 1963, then three divisions in 1974. Teams and their athletes must abide by NCAA rules in order to compete – the Arkansas Razorbacks were stripped of their 2004 and 2005 titles for recruitment violations, while Florida State University lost its 2007 NCAA Division I title because one of its athletes had not met the academic requirements.
