Before serving in Congress, Pierluisi worked in the private and public sectors as a lobbyist. Pierluisi, a member of New Progressive and the national Democratic Party was appointed the acting Secretary of State of Puerto Rico in July 2019, and assumed the office of governor on August 2, 2019 upon the resignation of Ricardo Rosselló. Pierluisi stated that if the Senate of Puerto Rico didn't confirm or validate his position as former Secretary of State, he would resign the governorship. However, he subsequently walked back that statement. On August 5, 2019, the Puerto Rico Senate filed a lawsuit against his appointment as governor.
