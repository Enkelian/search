Edward Hutchinson Synge
Edward Hutchinson Synge (1 June 1890 â€“ 26 May 1957) was an Irish physicist who published a complete theoretical description of the near-field scanning optical microscope, an instrument used in nanotechnology, several decades before it was experimentally developed. He never completed university yet did significant original research in both microscopy and telescopy. He was the first to apply the principle of scanning in imaging, which later became important in a wide range of technologies including television, radar, and scanning electron microscopy. He was the older brother of distinguished mathematician and theoretical physicist John Lighton Synge. Early life and education Edward Hutchinson Synge was born in 1891, in County Dublin, Ireland, to Edward Synge and Ellen Frances Price. He was familiarly known as "Hutchie".
