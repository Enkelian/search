Hegesistratus
In Ancient Greek historiographic tradition, Hegesistratus (Ἡγησίστρατος) was a Greek diviner for Mardonius during the Greco-Persian Wars. Originally an Elean, he had been captured by the Spartans and put in bonds. He escaped by cutting off a piece of his own foot and replaced it with a wooden one; however, he was captured again at Zacynthus and put to death. This story is mentioned in the ninth book (chapter 37) of the Histories written by Herodotus. References Herodotus, Histories, 9. 37. 1 - 4
