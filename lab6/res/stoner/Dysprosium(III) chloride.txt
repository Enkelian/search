Dysprosium(III) chloride
Dysprosium(III) chloride (DyCl3), also known as dysprosium trichloride, is a compound of dysprosium and chlorine. It is a white to yellow solid which rapidly absorbs water on exposure to moist air to form a hexahydrate, DyCl3.6H2O. Simple rapid heating of the hydrate causes partial hydrolysis to an oxychloride, DyOCl. Preparation and reactions DyCl3 is often prepared by the "ammonium chloride route," starting from either Dy2O3 or hydrated chloride or oxychloride. or DyCl3·6H2O. These methods produce (NH4)2[DyCl5]: 10 NH4Cl + Dy2O3 → 2 (NH4)2[DyCl5] + 6 NH3 + 3 H2ODyCl3·6H2O + 2 NH4Cl → (NH4)2[DyCl5] + 6 H2OThe pentachloride decomposes thermally according to the following equation: (NH4)2[DyCl5] → 2 NH4Cl + DyCl3The thermolysis reaction proceeds via the intermediacy of (NH4)[Dy2Cl7]. Treating Dy2O3 with aqueous HCl produces hydrated chloride (DyCl3·6H2O). This salt cannot be rendered anhydrous by heating. Instead one obtains an oxychloride. Dysprosium(III) chloride is a moderately strong Lewis acid, which ranks as "hard" according to the HSAB concept. Aqueous solutions of dysprosium chloride can be used to prepare other dysprosium(III) compounds, for example dysprosium(III) fluoride: DyCl3 + 3 NaF → DyF3 + 3 NaCl Uses Dysprosium(III) chloride can be used as a starting point for the preparation of other dysprosium
