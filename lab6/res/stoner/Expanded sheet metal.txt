Expanded sheet metal
Expanded metal is a type of sheet metal which has been cut and stretched to form a regular pattern (often diamond-shaped) of metal mesh-like material. It is commonly used for fences and grates, and as metallic lath to support plaster or stucco. Description Expanded metal is stronger than an equivalent weight of wire mesh such as chicken wire, because the material is flattened, allowing the metal to stay in one piece. The other benefit to expanded metal is that the metal is never completely cut and reconnected, allowing the material to retain its strength. History The inventor and patentee of expanded metal is John French Golding, his first British patent was issued in 1884. He forged partnerships with Hartlepool industrialists Mathew Gray, Christopher Furness and Robert Irving Jr. who together with W.B Close, brought the manufacture of expanded metal to Hartlepool. The Expanded Metal Company Limited of Hartlepool, United Kingdom remains a recognised market leader globally in the manufacture of expanded metal to this day and is one of the largest employers in the local area. Design Some commonly used shapes are circles, squares, and diamonds; diamonds are the most popular shapes because of how well the shape absorbs energy
