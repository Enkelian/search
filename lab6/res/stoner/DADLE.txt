DADLE
DADLE ([D-Ala2, D-Leu5]-Enkephalin) is a synthetic opioid peptide with analgesic properties. Although it is often considered a selective delta opioid receptor agonist, it also binds to the Î¼1 subtype of mu opioid receptors. Treatment with DADLE results in transient depression of mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate.Its peptide sequence is Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-Phe-D-Leu. See also DAMGO DPDPE == References ==
