The Norman Whitfield Sessions
The Norman Whitfield Sessions is compilation album of songs by Marvin Gaye from 1962 to 1969. The album covers the Norman Whitfield-produced sessions of soul singer Marvin Gaye's late sixties period as he moved away from teen pop-driven R&B songs that made him a pop star. It covers more mature, grittier and funkier material as Whitfield guided the direction of Gaye's career, the high point being the 1968 song, "I Heard It Through the Grapevine", which became Gaye's first international smash. Other hits during that period included the more upbeat "Too Busy Thinking About My Baby", the darker "That's the Way Love Is" and "The End of Our Road". The collection includes "Wherever I Lay My Hat", which Whitfield co-penned and produced with Gaye on his That Stubborn Kinda Fellow; the song was covered by British singer Paul Young. There are covers of rock songs such as "Groovin'", "Yesterday", "Abraham, Martin & John" and two Temptations covers ("Cloud Nine" and "I Wish It Would Rain").
