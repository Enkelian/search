Philips Avent, stylized as Philips AVENT, is a child care brand which manufactures baby bottles, breast pumps, and other baby feeding and health accessories. It is based in Glemsford, Suffolk, England. The name AVENT came from the sub-brand Avent Naturally which was launched by a Company called Cannon Rubber (est.1936). The brand was created in 1984 to launch a new type of baby bottle that was short with a wide neck. Avent was the first baby feeding company to produce teats from odourless and tasteless silicone as well as other patented innovations such a steam and microwave steriliser and piston-free breast Pump. In 2005, Charterhouse Venture Capital acquired the company, then known as Cannon Avent. In 2006, Dutch company Philips acquired the brand and renamed it as Philips Avent.
