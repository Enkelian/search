Nickname and mascot history Following its win over Cal in the first-ever Big Game in 1892, the color cardinal was picked as the primary color of Stanford's athletic teams. White was adopted as a secondary color in the 1940s. On November 25, 1930, following a unanimous vote by the Executive Committee for the Associated Students, the athletic department adopted the mascot "Indian". A few months after the football team's second straight win in the Rose Bowl in January 1972, the Indian symbol and name were dropped by President Richard Lyman, after objections from Native American students and a vote by the student senate.From 1972
