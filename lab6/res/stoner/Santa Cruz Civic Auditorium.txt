Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium
The Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium is an event and convention venue located in downtown Santa Cruz, California. It is owned by the City of Santa Cruz and is located at 307 Church Street. Opened in 1940, it was built in what was described as "mission style in architecture with a modern touch and an arrangement of open porches on the corners and sides." Its style has also been described as Art Deco. It is the home of the Santa Cruz County Symphony as well as other concerts, expos, conferences, and sporting events. A carillon was installed in 1963.The Civic Auditorium was the site of the annual Miss California beauty pageant until 1985, when the pageant left Santa Cruz after years of protests and a "Myth California" counterpageant organized by local feminist activists led by Ann Simonton and Nikki Craft. In 1956, it was the location of a rock and roll concert that drew national attention after the local police stopped the event because of what they characterized as the dancers' "suggestive, stimulating and tantalizing motions". The auditorium was used as a temporary shelter for displaced and homeless people following the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. References External links Official website "History
