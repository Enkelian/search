Ariarathes V of Cappadocia
Ariarathes V Eusebes Philopator (Ancient Greek: Ἀριαράθης Ε΄ Εὐσεβής Φιλοπάτωρ, Ariaráthēs Eusebḗs Philopátōr; reigned 163–130 BC) was a son of the preceding king Ariarathes IV of Cappadocia and queen Antiochis. He was distinguished by his contemporaries for his excellence of his character and his cultivation of philosophy and the liberal arts and is considered by some historians to have been the greatest of the kings of Cappadocia. Early life Ariarathes V was the son of Ariarathes IV of Cappadocia, and a Greek mother, Antiochis, who was the daughter of the Seleucid King Antiochus III. According to Livy, he was educated in Rome; but this account may perhaps refer to another Ariarathes. Rather, Ariarathes Eusebes probably spent his youth studying in Athens, where he seems to have become a friend of the future king of Pergamon, Attalus II Philadelphus. Reign In consequence of rejecting, at the wish of the Romans, a marriage with Laodice V, the sister of Demetrius I Soter, the latter made war upon Ariarathes, and brought forward Orophernes of Cappadocia, his brother and one of the supposed sons of the late king, as a claimant of the throne. Ariarathes was deprived of his kingdom, and fled to Rome
