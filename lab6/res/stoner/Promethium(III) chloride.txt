Promethium(III) chloride
Promethium(III) chloride is a chemical compound of promethium and chlorine with the formula PmCl3. Applications Promethium(III) chloride (with 147Pm) has been used to generate long-lasting glow in signal lights and buttons. This application relied on the unstable nature of promethium, which emitted beta radiation (electrons) with a half-life of several years. The electrons were absorbed by a phosphor, generating visible glow. Unlike many other radioactive nuclides, promethium-147 does not emit alpha particles that would degrade the phosphor. == References ==
