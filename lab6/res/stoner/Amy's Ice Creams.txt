While in Boston, as a premedical major at Tufts University, Amy worked for Steve's Ice Cream. After Steve's Ice Cream was purchased by a larger corporation, Amy decided to go into business for herself. Amy and her business partner Scott Shaw eventually decided to open their ice cream shop in Austin. They wrote a check for the lease of their first store on Guadalupe Street in Austin. Amy has since opened fourteen more locations, with the majority of them in Austin, one in Houston, and one in San Antonio. In 2009, owner Amy Simmons stated that she does not intend to rapidly expand the chain.In 2017, the company reported a $9 million revenue. References External links Amy's Ice Creams
