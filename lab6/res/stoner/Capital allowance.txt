Capital allowance
Capital allowances is the practice of allowing a company to get tax relief on tangible capital expenditure by allowing it to be expensed against its annual pre-tax income. Generally, the capital allowances will exist for only specified items of tangible capital expenditure, and the expensing is usually spread over a fixed period of years. The term is used in the UK and in Ireland. Unusually, the Irish corporate tax system has a capital allowances for intangible assets scheme which allows intangible assets to be expensed against Irish pre-tax income. It is a key Irish base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) tool that U.S. multinationals use to achieve Irish corporate effective tax rates of <3%, and was used by Apple in Ireland in 2015 (leprechaun economics). Capital allowances are in contrast with depreciation, which is not allowed as a deduction for tax purposes, and must be added back to net profit for tax purposes. If capital expenditure does not qualify for a capital allowance, then it means that the business gets no tax relief on such expenditure.
