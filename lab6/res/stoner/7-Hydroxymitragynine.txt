7-Hydroxymitragynine
7-Hydroxymitragynine is a terpenoid indole alkaloid from the plant Mitragyna speciosa, commonly known as Kratom. In mice, it is orally active and has analgesic effects.7-Hydroxymitragynine is an agonist at the μ-opioid receptor with a potency, calculated using pD (2) values, that is 30-fold higher than that of mitragynine and 17-fold higher than that of morphine, respectively. As a partial agonist at this receptor it causes significantly milder side effects than morphine, like constipation, development of tolerance and withdrawal syndrome upon abstinence. In murine models, the extracted alkaloids of the Kratom plant are shown to cause an insignificant amount of drug induced respiratory depression, unlike full μ-opioid agonists. The O-acetyl ester (Acetoxy), 7-acetoxymitragynine has also been reported and found to be a weak μ-opioid agonist.
