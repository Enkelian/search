Greenberg v. National Geographic
Greenberg v. National Geographic was a copyright lawsuit regarding image use and republication rights of National Geographic Society to their magazine in electronic form. Details After the National Geographic released a digital archive containing every monthly issue of National Geographic magazine in 1997, photographer Jerry Greenberg took the Society to court over the reproduction of photographs that National Geographic had licensed from him. National Geographic withdrew this archive from the market in 2004 until after litigation was finished. The archive, called "The Complete National Geographic on CD-ROM and DVD", contained image duplicates of the print magazines. The plaintiffs argued that the archive was a "revision", and thus National Geographic did not hold the license to republish. National Geographic argued that the archive, which included an introductory sequence set to music and a search feature, was a new work.

National Geographic), prior to the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in a similar case later that same year involving the same statute of the U.S. Copyright law (New York Times Co. v.
