Endogenous
Endogenous substances and processes are those that originate from within a system such as an organism, tissue, or cell. The term is chiefly used in biology but also in other fields.Endogenous substances and processes contrast with exogenous ones, such as drugs, which originate from outside of the organism. Endogenous substances Cell signalling systems such as hormone and neurotransmitter systems use endogenous substances. Endogenous substances can regulate sleep. Examples of endogenous substances, and systems that use them, include The endogenous cannabinoid system, from which the term "endocannabinoid" derives. The endocannabinoid system is important in physiology but can be modulated by exogenous phytocannabinoids originating from outside the organism, such as THC. Endogenous steroids. Endogenous opioids, which are peptides, such as enkephalins and endorphins, that can modulate the opioid system. The term "endorphin" is derived from "endogenous morphine". Nitric oxide, which is an endogenous cell signalling molecule. Nitric oxide was identified as the substance previously known as endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF), which was known to be an endogenous substance responsible for the relaxation of vascular endothelium. Sulfur dioxide.Endogenous transcription factors are those manufactured by the cell, as distinguished from cloned transcription factors.Endogenous substances typically have some physiological utility. However substances can also be
