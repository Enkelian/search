Silent Civilian
Silent Civilian is an American metal band originating from Los Angeles, California, United States. Following his departure from nu metal band Spineshank in 2004, frontman Jonny Santos felt he wanted to move in a different direction musically and start from scratch. Silent Civilian was thus formed and the band faced trouble from the start after experiencing several line-up changes and departing from their original record label Corporate Punishment Records. The band signed with Mediaskare Records and released their debut record, Rebirth of the Temple, on May 2, 2006. Receiving generally positive reviews, the album has sold more than 25,000 copies since its release in the United States. The band continues to tour supporting the record as Santos one day wants to establish the band as a headlining act. Their line-up consists of Santos (vocals and guitar), Matt Bredemeier (guitar) and Robbie Young (bass). Silent Civilian released their second album, Ghost Stories, on May 18, 2010. The band has plans to release a third studio album. As of December 2017 no new material has been released.
