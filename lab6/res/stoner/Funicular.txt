Funicular
A funicular () is a type of a grade-separated fixed guideway transit system powered by a cable traction designed for steep inclines. Specifically this system is using two counterbalanced track-guided passenger cars or small trains permanently attached to the opposite ends of a single cable — which is looped over a pulley at the upper end of the track.A funicular's two cars move in concert: as one ascends, the other descends simultaneously, an arrangement that distinguishes a funicular from other cable-guided transportation systems — e.g., a single car inclined elevator.The term funicular derives from the Latin word funiculus, the diminutive of funis, meaning "rope". Operation In a funicular both cars (or trains) are permanently connected to the opposite ends of the same cable, known as a haul rope. At the engine room at upper end of the track the haul rope runs through a system of pulleys. Sheave wheels guide the cable along the track to and from the drive mechanism and the cars. The rope pulls one car upwards while the other car descends the slope as the other end of the rope is paid out from the engine mechanics. This arrangement counterbalances the two cars and thereby reduces
