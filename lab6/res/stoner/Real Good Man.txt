Real Good Man
"Real Good Man" is a song written by Rivers Rutherford and George Teren and recorded by American country music singer Tim McGraw. It was released in May 2003 as the fourth single from McGrawâ€™s 2002 album Tim McGraw and the Dancehall Doctors. The song reached number one on the US Billboard Hot Country Singles and Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) chart. Content The narrator states to his significant other that while he may be a "bad boy", he is a "real good man". Critical reception Rick Cohoon of Allmusic reviewed the song favorably, saying that the song "offers a unique melody." Cohoon goes on to say that McGraw can "party with the best of 'em" but also "touts his softer side complete with soft-as-velvet hands and a patriotic spirit." Music video The music video, directed by Sherman Halsey, premiered in mid-2003, was filmed live in concert, and was released as a double-song video with "The Ride," a cover of the David Allan Coe hit. A special promotional single of this double-song performance was sent to radio stations. While the live version of "Real Good Man" did eventually appear on McGraw's Greatest Hits 3 CD, it did not contain "The Ride";
