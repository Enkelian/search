Lovepump United Records
Lovepump United is an independent record label founded in 2004 by Vassar College students Jake Friedman and Mookie Singerman in Poughkeepsie, New York. The label is based in New York City. Friedman and Singerman were the only members of a duo Glitter Pals whose EP was Lovepump's first release; the band has disbanded. Singerman is also the vocalist for Philadelphia-based "cybergrind" band Genghis Tron whose Cloak of Love EP was the second Lovepump release. Lovepump first gained attention in indie music circles by releasing the debut album by the much buzzed about Montreal based noise rock band AIDS Wolf in January 2006.
