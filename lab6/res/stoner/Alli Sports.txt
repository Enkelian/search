Alli Sports (legally Alli, Alliance of Action Sports, LLC) is an organizer of extreme sports events that is subsidiary of the NBC Sports Ventures LLC, a unit of NBC Sports Group. The group was formed in 2008 as a joint venture between NBC and MTV Networks, when the latter bought a stake in an extreme sports tour that NBC had been operating, the Dew Tour. While MTV parent Viacom has since sold its share in the venture, it still operates as a part of NBC. History Alli was formed in 2008 after NBC sold a stake in the extreme sports tour, the Dew Tour, it had run in partnership with Live Nation, the Dew Tour, to MTV Networks. NBC Sports' chairman Dick Ebersol believed that the Tour needed a secondary broadcast partner, and NBC staff believed that access to MTV's cable channels would help provide exposure to the tour to its target demographic. The partnership adopted the brand Alli, established a new online operation for the group, and added MTV2 as a new broadcast partner for the Dew Tour. Under MTV's part-ownership, Alli also expanded its operations with several new tours, such as the Winter Dew Tour, Gatorade Free Flow
