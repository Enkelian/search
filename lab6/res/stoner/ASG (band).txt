ASG (band)
ASG is an American stoner metal band signed to Relapse Records, originating from Wilmington, North Carolina. It is a four-piece band, with Jason Shi on vocals and guitar, Andy Ellis on bass, Scott Key on drums and Jonah Citty on guitar. The band has acquired an underground following, as a number of its songs have been featured in skateboarding, surfing, and snowboarding videos. Band ASG started with the name All Systems Go in 2001, but shortened to the acronym ASG after a brief copyright issue with another band of the same name. Through the years the band has claimed in jest that 'ASG' has several alternate meanings, including "amplification of self gratification", "all systems gone", "anarchist school for girls" among others. ASG recorded and self released their debut album/demo in 2002 (later released by Volcom in 2005). Soon after in 2003 they signed with Volcom Entertainment In 2003, they released their first full length with Volcom Entertainment, "The Amplification of Self-Gratification", and immediately began a tour to promote it, playing portions of the 2003 and 2004 Vans Warped Tour. After the '04 Vans Warped Tour, ASG went to Los Angeles to record their 2nd Volcom release, Feeling Good is Good
