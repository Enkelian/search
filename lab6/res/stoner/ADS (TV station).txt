ADS (TV station)
ADS is an Australian television station based in Adelaide, South Australia. It is owned and operated by CBS Studios International through their Australian holdings Network 10. History ADS-10 began as ADS-7 on 24 October 1959. In the late 1980s ADS-7 was bought by media entrepreneur Kerry Stokes, who also owned CTC-7 in Canberra. In 1987, Stokes planned to buy the Seven Network from John Fairfax which would have seen ADS-7 Adelaide and CTC-7 Canberra align with ATN-7 Sydney and HSV-7 Melbourne. Stokes offered $100 million more than rival Christopher Skase for Seven, but was ultimately unsuccessful. Unable to build a metropolitan Seven television network, on 7 August 1987, Stokes sold ADS, CTC and his licence for NEW Perth to Northern Star Holdings, owners of Network Ten. On 27 December 1987, ADS-7 and SAS-10 (owned by Seven Network affiliate TVW-7 Perth starting in the 1970s) switched affiliations, ADS moving to channel 10, SAS moving to channel 7. In July 2007 ADS-10 moved from its original location on Strangways Terrace, North Adelaide to a new studio on the corner of Wakefield and Hutt streets in the city.
