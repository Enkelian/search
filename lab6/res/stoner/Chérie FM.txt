Chérie FM
Chérie FM is a French radio station created in 1987 and belongs to the NRJ Group. History Chérie FM is created in 1987 in Paris by Jean-Paul Baudecroux on the then defunct frequency of Gilda la Radiopolitaine. Chérie FM then started broadcasting nationally in 1989 when the NRJ Group acquires the frequencies of Pacific FM. Most frequencies of the station were affiliated to Chérie FM (but the Parisian frequency of Pacific FM was used to create Rire & Chansons). In 1992, the NRJ Group decides to expand the Chérie FM network outside France, to launch Chérie FM Belgique in Belgium broadcasting only in French in Wallonia and Brussels. Chérie FM stopped broadcasting in May 2008, after 16 years of activity.A variant of the radio station on TV is launched by the NRJ Group on 12 December 2012, and is named Chérie 25. It broadcasts in France on TNT and in high definition. However, the programming is different from that of the radio station. Chérie 25 aims primarily to a female audience like Chérie FM, but the programming schedule includes magazines, documentaries as well as entertainment, TV series and movies.
