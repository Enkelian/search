Stuttgart S-Bahn
The Stuttgart S-Bahn is a suburban railway system (S-Bahn) serving the Stuttgart Region, an urban agglomeration of around 2.7 million people, consisting of the city of Stuttgart and the adjacent districts of Esslingen, Böblingen, Ludwigsburg and Rems-Murr-Kreis. The Stuttgart S-Bahn comprises seven lines numbered S1 through S6 and S60, and is operated by S-Bahn Stuttgart, a subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn. The system is integrated with the regional transport cooperative, the Verkehrs- und Tarifverbund Stuttgart (VVS), which coordinates tickets and fares among all transport operators in the metropolitan area. Lines All lines lead through the city centre of Stuttgart. The northeastern end of the tunnel (from the tracks near Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof through Schwabstraße) was the first part of the tunnel to open and has been used since the beginning, the southwestern end from Schwabstraße through Universität since 1985. The main node to change for Stuttgart Stadtbahn is at Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof, but at Stuttgart Stadtmitte S-Bahn-station, you can get to some more lines of the Stadtbahn (with the station's name being Rotebühlplatz). In the outer city districts there are nodes of S-Bahn and Stadtbahn at Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt station and Stuttgart-Vaihingen station. Schedule The Stuttgart S-Bahn has a "memory schedule" or clock-face schedule.
