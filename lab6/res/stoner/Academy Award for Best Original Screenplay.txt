Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay
The Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay is the Academy Award for the best screenplay not based upon previously published material. It was created in 1940 as a separate writing award from the Academy Award for Best Story. Beginning with the Oscars for 1957, the two categories were combined to honor only the screenplay. See also the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, a similar award for screenplays that are adaptations. Superlatives Woody Allen has the most nominations in this category with 16, and the most awards with 3 (for Annie Hall, Hannah and Her Sisters, and Midnight in Paris). Paddy Chayefsky has also won three screenwriting Oscars: two for Original Screenplay (The Hospital and Network) and one for Adapted Screenplay (Marty). Woody Allen also holds the record as the oldest winner (76) for Midnight in Paris. Ben Affleck is the youngest winner (25) for Good Will Hunting, co-written with Matt Damon (27). Richard Schweizer was the first to win for a foreign-language film, Marie-Louise. Other winners for a non-English screenplay include Albert Lamorisse, Pietro Germi, Claude Lelouch, Pedro Almod√≥var, Bong Joon-ho and Han Jin-won. Lamorisse is additionally the only person to win or even be nominated for Best Original
