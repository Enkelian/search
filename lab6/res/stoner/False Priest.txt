There's a lot of very dancey, very funky songs... We try to have these 'holy fuck' moments where you're really having your mind blown, especially if you're listening to it on headphones."The album also features appearances by Janelle Mon√°e and Solange Knowles, and marks the return of organic instruments such as live drums, strings and pianos.
