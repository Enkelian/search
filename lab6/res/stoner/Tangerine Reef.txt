Tangerine Reef
Tangerine Reef is the second visual album by American experimental pop band Animal Collective, released on August 17, 2018, through Domino. It is the band's first full-length release without Panda Bear, and was made in collaboration with art-science duo Coral Morphologic and in celebration of the International Year of the Reef. It was the band’s first visual album since 2010’s ODDSAC. The album is accompanied by a film, which premiered on the band's website upon release. Background and recording Tangerine Reef is the product of longtime collaborations between Animal Collective and Coral Morphologic, an art-science duo consisting of marine biologist Colin Foord and musician J.D. McKay. The two groups first met in 2010 at a screening of Animal Collective's ODDSAC, when Coral Morphologic gave Deakin a DVD consisting of their work. The members of Animal Collective were impressed by the footage and reached out, leading to several collaborations, such as Geologist soundtracking Coral Morphologic's 2011 short film Man o War, and Foord providing spoken word on Avey Tare's solo album Eucalyptus. The two groups have also gone scuba diving together.The genesis of Tangerine Reef came in February 2017 at an art exhibition called "Coral Orgy", hosted at New World Center
