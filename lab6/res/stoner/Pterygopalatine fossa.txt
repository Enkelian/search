Pterygopalatine fossa
In human anatomy, the pterygopalatine fossa (sphenopalatine fossa) is a fossa in the skull. A human skull contains two pterygopalatine fossaeâ€”one on the left side, and another on the right side. Each fossa is a cone-shaped paired depression deep to the infratemporal fossa and posterior to the maxilla on each side of the skull, located between the pterygoid process and the maxillary tuberosity close to the apex of the orbit. It is the indented area medial to the pterygomaxillary fissure leading into the sphenopalatine foramen. It communicates with the nasal and oral cavities, infratemporal fossa, orbit, pharynx, and middle cranial fossa through eight foramina. Structure Boundaries It has the following boundaries: anterior: superomedial part of the infratemporal surface of maxilla posterior: root of the pterygoid process and adjoining anterior surface of the greater wing of sphenoid bone medial: perpendicular plate of the palatine bone and its orbital and sphenoidal processes lateral: pterygomaxillary fissure inferior: part of the floor is formed by the pyramidal process of the palatine bone. Passages The following passages connect the fossa with other parts of the skull: Functions The pterygopalatine fossa contains the pterygopalatine ganglion suspended by nerve roots from the maxillary nerve the terminal third
