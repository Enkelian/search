Crow (band)
Crow was a Minneapolis-based blues rock band, that was first active from 1967 to 1972. They are best known for the song "Evil Woman (Don’t Play Your Games With Me)," which was notably covered by Black Sabbath and Ike & Tina Turner. History Crow was formed in 1967 by singer David Wagner, guitarist Dick Wiegand, bassist Larry Wiegand, keyboardist Kink Middlemist, and drummer Harry Nehls under the name South 40, which was used until the group went national. Nehls was replaced by Denny Craswell at that time. Columbia Records brought them in to record a demo in 1969; they passed, and Crow was signed to Amaret.In 1969, Crow’s debut album Crow Music was recorded. The single "Evil Woman (Don’t Play Your Games With Me)" made the Top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100 that fall, peaking at #19 the following January. Crow by Crow and Mosaic were the follow-up releases in 1970 and 1971 respectively. Singles released off Crow's later albums were not as successful; the band wanted to move to Elektra Records, but Amaret would not release them from their recording contract while retaining their name. Wagner left the group in 1971; the band replaced him with Mick Stanhope
