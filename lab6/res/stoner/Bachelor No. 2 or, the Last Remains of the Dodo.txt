Bachelor No. 2 or, the Last Remains of the Dodo
Bachelor No. 2 or, the Last Remains of the Dodo (also shortened to Bachelor No. 2) is the third studio album by American singer-songwriter Aimee Mann, released on May 2, 2000. The album is notable for the fact that Mann was initially without a record company and sold the album through her website, but the album went on to gain a worldwide release and achieve respectable sales. This was aided by the success of the Magnolia soundtrack, for the film of the same name by Paul Thomas Anderson, with which the album shares material. The first release was a limited-run 7-song preview EP which was sold at concerts and via her website. The full album was slated for a release through Interscope, but they did not think the material had commercial appeal. Mann purchased back the rights for "six figures", and began selling the album online. It was one of the first albums to be successful with only online sales, eventually selling 25,000 copies from Mann's website. After attracting attention, a distribution deal to traditional retail channels led to sales topping 200,000. As of 2008, sales in the United States have exceeded 230,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan.The Japanese version
