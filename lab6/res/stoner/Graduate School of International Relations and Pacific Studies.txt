Graduate School of International Relations and Pacific Studies
The School of Global Policy and Strategy (GPS) at the University of California San Diego, formerly the Graduate School of International Relations and Pacific Studies (IR/PS), is devoted to the study of international affairs, economics, and policy education. Until 2015, it stood as the only professional school of international affairs that was exclusively focused on Asia and the Americas. GPS provides a unique resource for training leaders, creating ideas, and building networks for the Pacific Century. The curriculum blends a mix of three professional school traditions-schools of international relations, public policy, and management.
