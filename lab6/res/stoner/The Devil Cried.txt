The Devil Cried
"The Devil Cried" is a song by heavy metal band Black Sabbath featured on the compilation Black Sabbath: The Dio Years. The song peaked on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks at No. 38. It was one of three new recordings the group did for the compilation (the others being "Shadow of the Wind" and "Ear in the Wall"). Tony Iommi has called the song, "a mid-tempo track which is... riff-based again, great vocals and I think that's really good."According to Dio on the "Heaven and Hell Road Movie" extra on the Live from Radio City Music Hall DVD, the song is about the ability to return to Heaven if a soul in Hell could succeed in making Satan cry. == References ==
