Mark and Lard
Mark and Lard was the stage name of Mark Radcliffe (Mark) and Marc Riley (Lard), who presented various weekday shows on BBC Radio 1 from 1991 to March 2004. Career Radcliffe, then a Radio 1 producer, began presenting specialist shows on the network in 1991, namely Out on Blue Six, The Guest List and Skyman. During this time, he also hosted Hit the North, a weekly Radio 5 music and comedy show from Manchester with Riley as its researcher, and latterly, co-producer and presenter. Riley also presented his own series, Cult Radio, during the summer of 1993. On 25 October 1993, the pair transferred to Radio 1 full-time and began presenting a late night show from 10pm-midnight on Mondays-Thursdays, replacing Nicky Campbell's Into the Night. The Graveyard Shift featured a mix of comedy sketches, poetry readings, live sessions and guests, including regular contributors such as Mark Kermode, Mark Lamarr, Stuart Maconie, Ian McMillan and Katie Puckrik. Following Chris Evans' departure from Radio 1, Mark and Lard transferred to the flagship Radio 1 Breakfast Show in February 1997 - which they had presented as stand-ins for Evans. But low ratings led to the pair being replaced by Kevin Greening and Zoe
