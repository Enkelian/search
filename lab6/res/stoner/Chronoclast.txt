Chronoclast
Chronoclast (Selected Essays on Time-Reckoning and Auto-Cannibalism) is the third album by Canadian band Buried Inside. It is a concept album about time and how it controls people. The booklet contains numerous quotes about time, from fiction and non fiction works. The lyrics themselves are also highly allusive; for example, the last lines of "Time as Commodity" paraphrase a quote by Eugene Debs.
