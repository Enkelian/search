Although renowned for his skill as a soldier, Alvarado is known also for the cruelty of his treatment of native populations, and mass murders committed in the subjugation of the native peoples of Mexico.Indigenous people, both Nahuatl-speakers and speakers of other languages, referred to him using the name of the sun-god Tōnatiuh. Character and appearance Pedro de Alvarado was flamboyant and charismatic, and was both a brilliant military commander and a cruel, hardened man. His hair and beard were red, which reminded them of their sun-god (often painted red) Tōnatiuh. He was handsome, and presented an affable appearance, but was volatile and quick to anger. He was ruthless in his dealings with the indigenous peoples he set out to conquer.
