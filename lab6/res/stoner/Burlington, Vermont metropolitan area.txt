Burlington, Vermont metropolitan area
The Burlington metropolitan area is a metropolitan area consisting of the three Vermont counties of Chittenden, Franklin, and Grand Isle. The metro area is anchored by the principal cities of Burlington, South Burlington, St. Albans and Winooski; the towns of Colchester, Essex and Milton; and the village of Essex Junction. According to 2012 U.S. Census estimates, the metro area had an estimated population of 213,701, approximately one third of Vermont's total population. The area is often extended to include Clinton County in the adjacent state of New York and its seat of Plattsburgh. The Office of Management and Budget defines the area as one of its metropolitan statistical areas (the Burlington-South Burlington Metropolitan Statistical Area), a designation used for statistical purposes by the United States Census Bureau and other agencies. The MSA designation represents the counties containing the contiguous urbanized area centered on the city of Burlington, plus adjacent counties that are socially and economically linked to the urban core (as measured by commuting). An alternative definition using towns instead of counties as basic units is the Burlington-South Burlington New England City and Town Area (NECTA).
