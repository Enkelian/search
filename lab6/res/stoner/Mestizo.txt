Mestizo
Mestizo (; Spanish: [mesˈtiθo] (listen)) (fem. mestiza) is a term historically used in Spain and Hispanic America that originally referred to a person of combined European and Indigenous American descent, regardless of where the person was born. The term was used as an ethnic/racial category for mixed-race castas that evolved during the Spanish Empire. Although broadly speaking, mestizo means someone of mixed European/indigenous heritage, the term did not have a fixed meaning in the colonial period. It was a formal label for individuals in official documentation, such as censuses, parish registers, Inquisition trials, and other matters. Individuals were labeled by priests and royal officials as mestizos, but the term was also used for self identification.In the modern era, particularly in Hispanic America, mestizo has become more of a cultural term, with culturally mainstream Hispanic Americans regarded as, or termed "mestizos" regardless of their actual ancestry and with the term Indian being reserved exclusively for people who have maintained a separate indigenous ethnic identity, language, tribal affiliation, etc. The term mestizaje – taking as its root mestizo or mixed – came from the Latin word mixtus, meaning mixed. It is the modern Spanish word coined in the twentieth century for race
