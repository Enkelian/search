Sleep Train Arena
Sleep Train Arena, originally ARCO Arena and later Power Balance Pavilion, is a defunct indoor arena located in Sacramento, California, United States. Opened in 1988, it was the home of the Sacramento Kings of the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1988 to 2016. It hosted nearly 200 spectator events each year. The arena is named for The Sleep Train, a chain of mattress and bed retailers based in Rocklin that at the time of the agreement was a subsidiary of Mattress Firm, a Houston-based retailer that has since re-branded all Sleep Train stores as Mattress Firm. History The original ARCO Arena (1985â€“1988), where the Kings played their home games for three seasons (1985 to 1988), after moving from Kansas City had a capacity of 10,333 seats. This arena was also the home for the Sacramento Attack of the Arena Football League in 1992, their only season, the WNBA's Sacramento Monarchs until they folded in 2009 and the Sacramento River Rats of Roller Hockey International. Sleep Train Arena is located in a once isolated area on the expanding northern outskirts of the city. It was constructed at a cost of just $40 million, the lowest of any venue in the NBA.
