Tassili Airlines
Tassili Airlines (Arabic: طيران الطاسيلي‎) is an Algerian passenger airline, based in Algiers, that is owned by Sonatrach, the national state-owned oil company of Algeria. Founded in 1998, Tassili now provides scheduled services out of Houari Boumedienne Airport, as well as its charter flights and helicopter services, that were originally mainly for the Algerian oil industry. History Tassili Airlines was originally established in 1998 as a joint venture between Air Algérie (49%) and the Sonatrach company (51%), both of which are government-owned. Commercial services were launched on 8 April 1999, with a flight from Hassi Messaoud to Algiers. In April 2005, Air Algérie withdrew its funds in the airline, which thus became wholly owned by Sonatrach. Tassili Airlines became a member of AFRAA in 2014, since when it has continued its expansion of regional and international routes. Corporate affairs Ownership The airline is state-owned, being 100% owned by Sonatrach, the national state-owned oil company of Algeria.
