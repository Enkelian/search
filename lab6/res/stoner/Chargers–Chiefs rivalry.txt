Chargers–Chiefs rivalry
The Chargers–Chiefs rivalry is an American football rivalry between the National Football League (NFL)'s Los Angeles Chargers and Kansas City Chiefs. Since the American Football League (AFL) was established in 1960, the Chargers and the Chiefs have shared the same division, first being the AFL Western Conference, and since the AFL–NFL merger, the American Football Conference (AFC) West. Kansas City is one of three teams with a winning record against all of their divisional opponents with 100-plus head-to-head games played (along with the Dallas Cowboys and the Green Bay Packers). The Los Angeles Chargers are one of only two teams with a losing record against all of their divisional opponents with 100-plus head-to-head games played (along with the Detroit Lions). This holds true as of the end of the 2018 season.
