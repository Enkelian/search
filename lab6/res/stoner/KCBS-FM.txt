KCBS-FM
KCBS-FM (93.1 FM, "Jack FM") is a radio station in Los Angeles, California, serving Greater Los Angeles on 93.1 MHz and owned by Entercom. KCBS-FM airs an adult hits music format branded as "93.1 Jack FM". Unlike other radio stations airing the Jack FM format, KCBS-FM runs a fairly focused playlist of popular classic rock and alternative rock tracks. Currently, the station has no air staff except for Crystal Z with her "Jacktivities" (events and whatever announcements deemed worthy by "Jack") and Howard Cogan supplying prerecorded quips and remarks between songs. Unlike most other stations in this format, the call sign does not include any form of the word "Jack," opting instead to hold over the call letters from a previous format, including the station's corporate identity. This is similar to its sister station in New York City, which maintained its WCBS-FM call letters during its two-year run as "Jack FM" from 2005 to 2007. Although Jack proclaims that the station is run "in a dumpy little building in beautiful downtown Culver City", studios and offices for KCBS-FM are actually at the intersection of Venice Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue in Los Angeles, about half a mile north of Culver City.
