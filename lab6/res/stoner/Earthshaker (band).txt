Earthshaker (band)
Earthshaker (アースシェイカー, a-susheikā) is a Japanese heavy metal band that was formed in 1978 in Osaka. One of the first Japanese metal bands, they steered toward a poppier sound on later albums and dropped from worldwide view, preferring to record and tour in their home country. After a successful run, they broke up in 1994, but returned five years later and are still going strong today. Remarkably, the original quartet from the first album are still together. An early incarnation of the band included Minoru Niihara (of Loudness fame) as singer (originally bass and vocals).
