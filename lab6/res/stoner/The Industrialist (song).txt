The Industrialist (song)
"The Industrialist" is the title track and third and final single from Fear Factory's eighth studio album The Industrialist. Lyrically, the song talks about the end of the world as a punishment. As the title would suggest, the song is mainly industrial metal with strong thrash metal influence. The title track is Dino Cazares' favorite song from the album, because the song has all the elements of Fear Factory. "It starts out big and it goes into the syncopated double bass, kick drums pattern, syncopated with the guitars. And it just sounds like the big machine roll-along." Music video The music video for this song was uploaded to YouTube on November 22, 2012. The video was filmed in Graspop Metal Meeting in Dessel, Belgium in June 2012, and was directed and edited by James Zahn. Other than performers, the video shows factory, crowded traffic, and The Industrialist album cover embedded on a skyscraper. == References ==
