Flamenco rock
Flamenco rock or Andalusian rock is a rock music subgenre that emerged from (but is not limited to) the Spanish region of Andalusia throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s. There were some precedents like a couple of albums (Rock encounter and The Soul of Flamenco and the Essence of Rock) by Sabicas, a handful of singles by Smash, Gong, Galaxia, Flamenco or even the American band Carmen. However, Triana was recognized as a pioneer of the genre since their music focuses on an homogeneous fusion of the progressive rock and flamenco. Many bands that mixed progressive and symphonic rock with flamenco followed them such as Im√°n Califato independiente, Cai, Guadalquivir, Alameda or Mezquita; that's why the term Andalusian rock may be understood simply as flamenco prog. Medina Azahara turned from progressive to a hard rock outfit in the 1980s and they remain as one of the most popular flamenco rock bands in its home nation. Also other flamenco-influenced styles of rock emerged like the flamenco-folk band Veneno, flamenco-jazz-blues band Pata Negra among other bands that melted flamenco with African, reggae or Latin rhythms. == References ==
