Daejan Holdings
Daejan Holdings is a British-based property business, part of the Freshwater Group of companies. It has its headquarters at Freshwater House, Shaftesbury Avenue and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index. History The Company was formed in 1935 as Daejan Samoedra Estates Ltd to acquire rubber and coffee plantations in the Dutch East Indies, today's Indonesia, mostly on the island of Java. In 1949 an insurrection which led to the independence of Indonesia resulted in a number of plantations being occupied or destroyed. In 1959 Osias Freshwater reversed his property business (a number of landmark buildings in London) into the company and this is now its sole activity. The name of the Company changed to Daejan Holdings Limited. In 2012 Daejan bought 139-143 Oxford Street for £12.8 million.In December 2018, it was reported that Park West, a building managed by a Freshwater Group subsidiary, had a very high proportion of flats under investigation for being let out illegally. Operations Daejan is organised into two geographic segments - UK and US - of investment properties: residential and commercial. As at 31 March 2019, its portfolio was valued at £2.5 billion.
