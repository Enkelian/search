Bursting Out
Bursting Out is a 1978 live album by the rock band Jethro Tull. It was recorded at various locations during the European Heavy Horses Tour in May and June 1978. Though the specific recording dates and locations are not credited, the liner notes and stage introduction indicate that at least some tracks were recorded at the Bern Festhalle in Switzerland, on 28 May 1978. A spelling error on the spine of the first US, Spain and Sweden LP pressings listed the title as "Busting Out". Though released as a double-disc CD in the United Kingdom and in the rest of Europe, the original CD release in the United States was only one disc, with three tracks ("Quatrain", "Sweet Dream" and "Conundrum") omitted to fit the 80 minutes CD length, while the double-disc 1990 CD version in the United Kingdom (and Europe) incorporated the first track for both discs (the Introductions) in the song that follows. In 2004, the complete album was released worldwide as a two-disc set with the Introductions as separate tracks. Track listing All songs credited to Ian Anderson, unless otherwise noted.
