Spy Groove
Spy Groove (also known as SG) is an American adult animated series that aired for one season on Teletoon in Canada and for six episodes on MTV in the United States. It premiered on June 26, 2000 and ended on July 13, 2002. Spy Groove was created by Michael Gans, Richard Register and Kevin Thomsen, who also wrote and performed the voices for the show. The general plot is about two suave yet cocky secret agents, Agent Number One and Agent Number Two, and their boss, Helena Troy, who assigned them their missions.

It also features a number of pop songs in some episodes at the time of its broadcast.

The end credits sequence shows the protagonists (voiced by Gans and Register) chat and bicker together on topics irrelevant to the events of each episode, which was the only use of improvisation
