The first half of the album is leftover tracks from the 13 sessions, and the second half is live tracks recorded on tour between 2013 and 2014. Background The band recorded tracks at Shangri La Studios in Malibu with producer Rick Rubin during the sessions for 13, their nineteenth album. While Sabbath had been planning a follow-up to 13, the album was ultimately scrapped. Guitarist Tony Iommi had written "a whole load of riffs" for the abandoned LP, but "Geezer (Butler) didn't particularly want to do another album" Iommi said of the bassist. Lead singer Ozzy Osbourne also voiced not wanting to record another album saying "If we were to do an album before the tour, it would take three or four years to complete the album." Release The EP was intended to be promoted with The End Tour, being only available for purchase at live dates. Cover art for the disc was created
