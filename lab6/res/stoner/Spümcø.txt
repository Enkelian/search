The studio produced three animated series, two Flash-animated cartoon series, two music videos, five animated shorts, and a comic book. The company also produced content for a few animated spots and commercials. It won several awards, including an Annie Award for Best Animated Short Subject, for the Björk music video "I Miss You".Spümcø was founded in 1988 as a small office facility in the heart of Hollywood.
