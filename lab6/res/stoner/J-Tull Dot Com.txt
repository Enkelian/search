J-Tull Dot Com
J-Tull Dot Com (1999) is the 20th studio album by the British band Jethro Tull. It was released four years after their 1995 album Roots to Branches and continues in the same vein, marrying hard-rock with Eastern music influences. It is the first album to feature both Andrew Giddings on keyboards and Jonathan Noyce on bass, who would remain with the band until 2007, resulting in Jethro Tull's longest ever unchanged line-up. As of 2020, it is the last Jethro Tull album to feature all original, new material. Track listing All tracks are written by Ian Anderson, except where noted.On some versions of the CD there is a period of silence after "A Gift of Roses", followed by the title track of Anderson's (at the time unreleased) solo album The Secret Language of Birds. The track is preceded by a brief spoken word introduction of Anderson. This extends the length of "A Gift of Roses" to 9:16.
