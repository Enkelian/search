CONCACAF Champions League
The CONCACAF Champions League (also known as CONCACAF Champions Cup) is an annual continental club football competition organized by CONCACAF for the top football clubs in North America, Central America, and the Caribbean. The winner of the CONCACAF Champions League automatically qualifies for the quarter-finals of the FIFA Club World Cup. The tournament has officially been known as the Scotiabank CONCACAF Champions League since February 2015 to reflect Scotiabank's sponsorship. The competition has been completed 54 times through the 2019 event, with 56 champions due to a three-way shared title in the 1978 competition. The tournament currently uses a knockout format, though the tournament had a group stage prior to the 2018 tournament. Unlike its European and South American counterparts, the winners of the CONCACAF Champions League do not automatically qualify for the following season's competition.The competition was originally known as the CONCACAF Champions' Cup when it was first organized in 1962. The title has been won by 28 clubs, 17 of which have won the title more than once. Mexican clubs have accumulated the highest number of victories, with 34 titles in total. The second most successful league has been Costa Rica's Primera Divisi√≥n with six titles in total.
