Thumb
The thumb is the first digit (finger) of the hand. When a person is standing in the medical anatomical position (where the palm is facing to the front), the thumb is the outermost digit. The Medical Latin English noun for thumb is pollex (compare hallux for big toe), and the corresponding adjective for thumb is pollical. Definition Thumb and fingers The English word "finger" has two senses, even in the context of appendages of a single typical human hand: Any of the four terminal members of the hand, specifically those other than the thumb. Any of the five digits.Linguistically, it appears that the original sense was the second of these two: penkwe-ros (also rendered as penqr√≥s) was, in the inferred Proto-Indo-European language, a suffixed form of penkwe (or penqe), which has given rise to many Indo-European-family words (tens of them defined in English dictionaries) that involve or flow from concepts of fiveness. The thumb shares the following with each of the other four fingers: Having a skeleton of phalanges, joined by hinge-like joints that provide flexion toward the palm of the hand Having a dorsal surface that features hair and a nail, and a hairless palmar aspect with fingerprint ridgesThe
