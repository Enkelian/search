Brierley
Brierley () is a small town and former civil parish in the Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley in South Yorkshire, England. The civil parish was abolished in 2016. The settlement is tightly clustered and green buffered on a modest escarpment close to the border with West Yorkshire, it is almost wholly in population south of the A628 road, and is less than 2 miles (3 km) to the south west of Hemsworth. Its late nineteenth century founded civil parish contained the pit village of Grimethorpe, and at the 2001 census had a population of 5,973, increasing to 7,267 in the 2011 Census. Brierley is at its core approximately 330 feet (100 m) above sea level on gently undulating slopes. History Brierley was an early Saxon settlement.
