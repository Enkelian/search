Musée national Gustave Moreau
The Musée national Gustave Moreau is an art museum dedicated to the works of Symbolist painter Gustave Moreau (1826–1898). It is located in the 9th arrondissement of Paris at 14, rue de la Rochefoucauld, Paris, France. The museum was originally Moreau's dwelling, transformed by his 1895 decision into a studio and museum of his work with his apartment remaining on the first floor. Today the museum contains Moreau's drawings, paintings, watercolors, and sculptures. Description The building has three floors. Of the six small rooms on the ground floor overlooking a garden, four rooms are decorated with drawings and sketches of which are dedicated to the Italian masters. The first floor apartment (one dining room, one bedroom, a den and a hallway and an office-library) reminds the gallery patrons of its original purpose as the dwelling place of the Moreau family. The second floor has a large studio-room and the third floor has two rooms of a larger format. The collection consists of around 1200 paintings (mostly sketches or unfinished), pastels or watercolors and 4830 drawings kept in cabinets and cupboards with pivoting shutters and wholesale inventory numbers, drawn by Moreau himself, with nearly 5000 drawings (7800 aside).
