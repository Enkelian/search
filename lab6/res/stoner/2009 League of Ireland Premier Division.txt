Each team played every other team four times, totalling 36 matches. On the final day of the regular season Bohemians were crowned League of Ireland champions for the eleventh time in the club's history after drawing 1-1 with Bray Wanderers at the Carlisle Grounds. After the season ended both Derry City and Cork City were expelled from the League of Ireland. Derry City were accused of making extra payments to players using unofficial secondary contracts. This was against league rules which placed limits on the amount clubs could spend on players' wages. Cork City had been in serious financial difficulties for several seasons and its holding company was eventually wound up by the High Court. However both clubs were effectively reformed and were subsequently allowed to join the 2010 First Division.
