Something to Talk About (album)
Something to Talk About is a studio album by Canadian artist Anne Murray. It was released by Capitol Records in 1986. The album is so named after Murray rejected the song "Something to Talk About" written by fellow Canadian Shirley Eikhard — Bonnie Raitt went on to have a huge hit with the song. The album peaked at #2 for several weeks on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart - Anne's highest position. The disc was certified Gold by the RIAA.
