Enkimdu
Enkimdu is the Sumerian god of farming, in charge of canals and ditches, a task assigned to him by the water god Enki during his organization of the world. Enkimdu is featured prominently in the myth "Inanna Prefers the Farmer," in which both he and the god Dumuzi are attempting to win the hand of the goddess Inanna. While Inanna is quite infatuated with the down-to-earth farmer, her brother Utu/Shamash attempts to convince her to marry Dumuzi instead. Both Dumuzi and Enkimdu face off in an argument over who will win Inanna. While Dumuzi is aggressive in his arguments, attempting to prove that he is far better, Enkimdu is more docile and peaceful, attempting to resolve the situation diplomatically. The clay tablet on which the myth is written has been damaged over the passage of time, but from later myths such as "Dumuzi and Inanna" and "Inanna's Descent into the Underworld," it is clear that Inanna eventually selects Dumuzi as her spouse. Enkimdu in modern usage ENKIMDU is a name of an agent-based modeling platform used to study socio-ecological interactions in ancient Mesopotamia and villages in modern Thailand, "implemented entirely in standard Java". == Notes ==
