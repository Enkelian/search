Clearlight (band)
Clearlight is an instrumental stoner rock band from New Orleans, Louisiana. They are also known as The Mystick Krewe of Clearlight due to other bands using the same original name. History The Mystick Krewe of Clearlight was founded in 1996 as an instrumental side-project by members of New Orleans bands Eyehategod, Down and Crowbar. This project has allowed the members to explore music outside their native metal genre. After several years of shows in New Orleans with the occasional out-of-town show they recorded their self-titled debut album on Tee Pee Records in 2000. This was followed by The Father, the Son and the Holy Smoke, a 2001 split release with Acid King on Man's Ruin Records, featuring Scott "Wino" Weinrich (The Obsessed, Saint Vitus, Spirit Caravan, The Hidden Hand) on vocals. That same year they released a split 7" with The Obsessed that features both bands covering Lynyrd Skynyrd. The Mystick Krewe covers "Cheatin Woman" and features Pepper Keenan of Corrosion of Conformity on vocals. They have also been featured on compilations such as Inhale and High Volume: The Stoner Rock Collection. Members Jimmy Bower - guitar Paul Webb - guitar Andy Shepherd - bass Joey Lacaze - drums Ross
