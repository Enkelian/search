Sky Active
Sky Active was the brand name for interactive features on Sky Digital and was available in the UK and the Republic of Ireland. It enabled a viewer to interact with TV content, respond to an advertisement or access internet-based services. The service replaced Open.... which helped launch Sky Digital's interactive content, and launched many other features that viewers saw such as games, emailing and shopping via their TV. It could be accessed by pressing the red button on a Sky Digital remote, while watching any Sky Digital Channel. Alternatively, there was an entry in the "Interactive" area of the EPG. The service was shut down on 31 January 2015. External links Sky official website
