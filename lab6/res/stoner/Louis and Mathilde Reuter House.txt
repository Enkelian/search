Louis and Mathilde Reuter House
The Louis and Mathilde Reuter House is a private limestone home in central Austin, Texas, United States, in the historic Travis Heights neighborhood. The home was built by Louis Reuter, a local entrepreneur who moved to Austin in 1918 and later opened the city's first self-service grocery store. The home boasts an unusual U-shaped design that combines Spanish Revival and Mission Revival styling, with Palladian windows. The home was built without a precise blueprint but rather a "footprint" on the property which spared the grandiose old oak trees. The home is located at 806 Rosedale Terrace. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. == References ==
