Alazocine
Alazocine (developmental code name SKF-10047), also known more commonly as N-allylnormetazocine (NANM), is a synthetic opioid analgesic of the benzomorphan family related to metazocine, which was never marketed. In addition to its opioid activity, the drug is a sigma receptor agonist, and has been used widely in scientific research in studies of this receptor. Alazocine is described as a potent analgesic, psychotomimetic or hallucinogen, and morphine or opioid antagonist. Moreover, one of its enantiomers was the first compound that was found to selectively label the sigma σ1 receptor, and led to the discovery and characterization of the receptor. Pharmacology Pharmacodynamics Alazocine shows stereoselectivity in its pharmacodynamics. The (–)-enantiomer is a non-selective and high-affinity ligand of the μ-, κ-, and δ-opioid receptors (Ki = 3.0, 4.7, and 15 nM in guinea pig brain membranes) with very low affinity for the sigma σ1 receptor (Ki = 1,800–4,657 nM in guinea pig brain membranes). It acts as a moderate-efficacy partial agonist of the κ-opioid receptor (Ki = 0.4 nM, EC50 = 24 nM, and Emax = 66% for (±)-alazocine against the mouse receptor transfected in HEK293 cells) and as an antagonist of the μ-opioid receptor (Ki = 1.15 nM for (±)-alazocine against the
