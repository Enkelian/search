It contributes in the organisation of Superleague Greece and organizes the Greek Cup and the Greece national team. It is based in Athens. History The Hellenic Football Federation (HFF) was founded on 14 November 1926 by a decision of the three major Unions of the country: Athens, Piraeus and Thessalonica. Its foundation marked the organization of Greek football in compliance with international standards. Since then, the HFF has grown into the biggest sports federation in Greece, as football in the country is regarded as the "king of sports" coming first in the preferences of sports fans. The HFF is considered a private legal entity and a non-profit organization with registered offices in Athens.
