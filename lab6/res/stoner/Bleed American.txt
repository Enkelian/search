Bleed American
Bleed American is the fourth studio album by American rock band Jimmy Eat World, released on July 24, 2001, by DreamWorks Records.

Bleed American yielded four singles: "Bleed American", "The Middle", "Sweetness", and "A Praise Chorus"; each managed to enter the top twenty of at least one US chart.
