Misery Index is an American death metal band formed in 2001 in Baltimore, Maryland, United States, by Jason Netherton (vocals, bass), Mike Harrison (vocals, guitar), and Kevin Talley (drums). From 2006–2010, its line-up consisted of Netherton on vocals and bass, John Voyles on lead guitar, Mark Kloeppel on vocals and rhythm guitar, and Adam Jarvis on drums. In 2010, Voyles left the band and was replaced by Darin Morris. Background Misery Index's music is best described as death metal with strong hardcore punk and grindcore influences. Its lyrics tend to be highly critical of prevailing power structures in modern culture, everyday life and the ills of modern society. Their band name is derived from the economic indicator of the same name, which was also the namesake of the last album by Assück, from whom Misery Index also draw inspiration. Through the years, the band toured extensively, notably performing over 1000 concerts in 44 different countries from 2002 until 2013.The band runs its own record label, Anarchos Records, through which it has released a handful of titles, including its debut EP Overthrow in 2001, the Dissent EP in 2004, and the 2010 compilation Pulling Out the Nails.
