Safari Club
The Safari Club was an alliance of intelligence services formed in 1976 that ran covert operations around Africa at a time when the United States Congress had limited the power of the CIA after years of abuses and when Portugal was withdrawing from Africa, handing over power to Communist regimes. Its formal members were Iran, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Morocco and France. The group maintained informal connections with the United States, South Africa, Rhodesia and Israel. The group executed a successful military intervention in Zaire in response to an invasion from Angola. It also provided arms to Somalia in its 1977–1978 conflict with Ethiopia. It organized secret diplomacy relating to anti-Communism in Africa, and has been credited with initiating the process resulting in the 1979 Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty. Organization Alexandre de Marenches initiated the pact with messages to the four other countries—and to newly independent Algeria, which declined to participate.The original charter was signed in 1976 by leaders and intelligence directors from the five countries: Alexandre de Marenches, of le Service de Documentation Extérieure et de Contre-Espionnage, France's external intelligence agency Kamal Adham of Saudi Arabia's Al Mukhabarat Al A'amah The Egyptian Director of Intelligence Ahmed Dlimi, Moroccan Director of Intelligence
