Keelhaul (band)
Keelhaul is a four-piece progressive Mathcore/sludge metal band from Cleveland, Ohio. The members are Aaron Dallison (bass and vocals), Dana Embrose (guitar), Will Scharf (drums), and Chris Smith (guitar and vocals). The band toured Europe in April 2004, and subsequently went on a lengthy break. With no tours or new music recorded, Keelhaul entered the studio in December 2008 with producer Andrew Schneider to record their new album, Keelhaul's Triumphant Return to Obscurity. In the same month, the band resumed live activity with two shows, one in Philadelphia and the other in New York. In 2009 they played support to Isis for the Wavering Radiant tour (which took in dates across Europe), filling the bill with legendary Finnish band Circle.
