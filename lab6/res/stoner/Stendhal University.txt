Stendhal University
Stendhal University (French: Université Stendhal, also known as Grenoble III) was a university located in the outskirts of Grenoble, France that offered courses in foreign languages and cultures, ancient and modern literature, language and communication sciences. Having traditionally focused on training educators, it has more recently become known for preparing students for careers in journalism, communication and culture. Each year, the CUEF (University Center for French Studies) educated over 3,000 foreign students through various exchange programs in fields covering the entire spectrum of French studies. The last president was Lise Dumasy. History Grenoble III University was founded in 1970, but its origins date back to the Middle Ages and the University of Grenoble. In 1968, Edgar Faure created the Établissement public à caractère scientifique, culturel et professionnel (EPCSCP), endowed with considerable autonomy. Departments were eliminated and replaced by Teaching and Research Units (UER), which later became Training and Research Units (UFR). The founding charter of Grenoble University III, Stendhal, and its three native Grenoble counterparts (Grenoble I, Grenoble II and Grenoble-INP) was signed in 1970. From its early days, Grenoble III opened itself to new fields and helped create emerging language sciences, as well as Communication and Applied Foreign Languages
