Fokker 100
The Fokker 100 is a medium-sized, twin-turbofan jet airliner from Fokker, the largest such aircraft built by the company before its bankruptcy in 1996. The type possessed low operational costs and initially had scant competition in the 100-seat short-range regional jet class, contributing to strong sales upon introduction in the late 1980s.

In 1997, production of the Fokker 100 was terminated after 283 airframes had been delivered. By July 2019, a total of 101 Fokker 100 aircraft remained in airline service with 19 airlines around the world. Since the 2000s, airlines are retiring the aircraft, but there are still large numbers in operation in Australia and Iran.
