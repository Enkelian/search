Golf Channel
Golf Channel (also verbally referred to as simply Golf) is an American sports television network owned by the NBC Sports Group division of NBCUniversal, a subsidiary of Comcast. The channel focuses on coverage of the sport of golf, including live coverage of tournaments, as well as factual and instructional programming. It also houses the Golf Films franchise, a collection of independently produced biographical films that center around key figures and events in the history of golf. Founded in Birmingham, Alabama, the channel's headquarters and studios are currently located in Orlando, Florida (pending a re-location to Stamford, Connecticut alongside the remainder of NBC Sports). Golf Channel is available in the United States, Canada, Latin America and Southeast Asia through subscription television providers. As of September 2018, Golf Channel is available to approximately 70.3 million pay television households (76.2% of households with cable) in the United States. History The idea of a 24-hour golf network came from media entrepreneur Joseph E. Gibbs of Birmingham, Alabama, who first thought of such a concept in 1991. Gibbs felt there was enough interest in golf among the public to support such a network, and commissioned a Gallup Poll to see if his instincts were correct.
