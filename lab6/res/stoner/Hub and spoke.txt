Hub and spoke
The spoke-hub distribution paradigm is a form of transport topology optimization in which traffic planners organize routes as a series of "spokes" that connect outlying points to a central "hub". Simple forms of this distribution/connection model compare with point-to-point transit systems, in which each point has a direct route to every other point, and which modeled the principal method of transporting passengers and freight until the 1970s. Delta Air Lines pioneered the spoke-hub distribution model in 1955, and the concept revolutionized the transportation logistics industry after Federal Express demonstrated its value in the early 1970s. In the late 1970s the telecommunications and information-technology sector subsequently adopted this distribution topology, dubbing it the star network network topology. "Hubbing" involves "the arrangement of a transportation network as a hub-and-spoke model". Benefits The hub-and-spoke model, as compared to the point-to-point model, requires fewer routes. For a network of n nodes, only n - 1 routes are necessary to connect all nodes so the upper bound is n - 1, and the complexity is O(n). That compares favourably to the n ( n âˆ’ 1 ) 2 {\displaystyle {\frac {n(n-1)}{2}}} routes, or O(n2), which would be required to connect each node to every other
