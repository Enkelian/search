Citigroup Centre, London
The Citigroup Centre is a building complex in London. It houses Citigroup's EMEA headquarters and is located in Canary Wharf in the city's Docklands. The centre provides 170,000 square metres (1,800,000 sq ft) of floor space across two merged buildings - 33 Canada Square (known as "CGC1") and 25 Canada Square (known as "CGC2"), and houses the bulk of Citi's UK employee base. Together, both buildings form the Citigroup Centre complex. 25 Canada Square, or Citigroup Centre 2, stands at 200 metres (656 ft) and, alongside HSBC Tower (with which it was built in tandem), is the joint 4th-tallest building in the United Kingdom (behind The Shard, One Canada Square and Heron Tower).

The building was bought by RBS in 2004 along with 5 Canada Square (leased to Bank of America) for $1.12 billion. Subsequently, on 2 July 2007, CGC2 was individually sold to a joint venture between Quinlan Private and PropInvest for £1 billion (US$2 billion). Citigroup pay £46.5 million a year in rent for
