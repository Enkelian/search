1914 USC Trojans football team
The 1914 USC Trojans football team represented the University of Southern California (USC) in the 1914 college football season. In their first year under head coach Ralph Glaze, and following a three-year hiatus in the football program, the Trojans compiled a 4-3 record and outscored their opponents by a combined total of 116 to 88. The season featured USC's first game outside California and second game against future members of the Pacific Coast Conference and eventually the Pac-12 Conference (USC had played Stanford in 1905). In that game, played on November 26, 1914, USC lost to Oregon Agricultural (later Oregon State) by a 38 to 6 score. Schedule == References ==
