Case Anton
Case Anton (German: Unternehmen Anton) was the military occupation of Vichy France carried out by Germany and Italy in November 1942. It marked the end of the Vichy regime as a nominally-independent state and the disbanding of its army (the severely-limited Armistice Army), but it continued its existence as a puppet government in Occupied France. One of the last actions of its armed forces before their dissolution was the scuttling of the French fleet in Toulon to prevent it from falling into Axis hands. Background A German plan to occupy Vichy France had been drawn up in December 1940 under the codename of Operation Attila and soon came to be considered as an operation with Operation Camellia, the plan to occupy Corsica. Operation Anton updated the original Operation Attila, including different German units and adding Italian involvement. For Adolf Hitler, the main rationale for permitting a nominally independent French state to exist was that it was, in the absence of German naval superiority, the only practical means to deny the use of the French colonies to the Allies. However, with the Allied landings in French North Africa on 8 November 1942, and French submission to Allied occupation, that rationale disappeared.
