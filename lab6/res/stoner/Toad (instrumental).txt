Toad (instrumental)
"Toad" is an instrumental by British rock band Cream and was released on their 1966 debut album, Fresh Cream. Composed by drummer Ginger Baker, the piece is a five-minute drum solo (with a brief guitar and bass introduction and ending). Although common in jazz, "Toad" is one of the earliest drum solos recorded by a rock group. Background "Toad" grew out of "Camels and Elephants", a composition Baker had recorded with the Graham Bond Organisation in 1965. However, it was not until he joined Cream that "Toad" was first recorded for their debut album, Fresh Cream (1966). Baker plays a sequence of drum patterns that are built up, varied, and then dropped, giving way to a new pattern. On the piece, Baker often produced complementary rhythms on the hi-hat, ride cymbal, double-bass drums and tom-toms simultaneously. Other recordings An extended sixteen-minute live version (of which 13 minutes is drum solo) appears on Cream's 1968 album Wheels of Fire. A slightly extended version of this recording, with some additional guitar and bass edited in from another performance, appears on Cream's four-disc compilation album Those Were the Days (1997). "Toad" also featured in Cream's reunion concert in May 2005 at the Royal
