SoFi Stadium
SoFi Stadium is a stadium and entertainment complex under construction in Inglewood, California, United States. It is located at the former site of the Hollywood Park Racetrack, approximately 3 miles (4.8 km) from LAX, immediately southeast of The Forum. Planned to open in July 2020, the stadium will serve as the home for the Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Chargers of the National Football League (NFL). It is also scheduled to host WrestleMania 37 in March 2021, Super Bowl LVI in February 2022 and the College Football Playoff National Championship in January 2023. During the 2028 Summer Olympics, the stadium is expected to host the opening and closing ceremonies, as well as soccer. Archery and axe-throwing will be held on the grounds outside the stadium. SoFi Stadium will be the third stadium, and second to be in current use, since the 1970 AFLâ€“NFL merger to be shared by two NFL teams (MetLife Stadium, in East Rutherford, New Jersey, is home to the New York Giants and New York Jets, as was its predecessor, Giants Stadium). It will be the fourth facility in the Los Angeles area to host multiple teams from the same league as Staples Center is home
