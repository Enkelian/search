Lansdowne, Maryland
Lansdowne is a census-designated place in southern Baltimore County, Maryland, United States, located just south of Baltimore city. As of the 2010 census, it had a population of 8,409. At the 2000 census and earlier, the area was delineated as part of the Lansdowne-Baltimore Highlands CDP. History In the late 1800s, the Whitaker Iron Company mined for ore in Lansdowne. Abandoned pits from the mining were filled up by underground springs creating small ponds and lakes. Lansdowne was mostly farmland, including the Kessler farm, MacLeod farm and Wades farm. When the railroad came, Lansdowne became known as a B&O town. Most people worked for the B&O, commuting by train into Baltimore City. The first station was named Coursey Station. The Coursey Station senior housing center takes its name from this. The two main roads were Hammonds Ferry Road and Hollins Ferry Road, both of which led to the Patapsco River where you could take a ferry across to the other side. Early churches included the Lutheran Church of Our Savior, St. Clements Catholic Church, Lansdowne United Methodist Church, Lansdowne Christian Church and the First Baptist Church. The Hull Memorial Christian Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places
