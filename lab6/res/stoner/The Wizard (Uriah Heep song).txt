The Wizard (Uriah Heep song)
"The Wizard" is a song by British rock band Uriah Heep, from their 1972 album Demons & Wizards. It was the first single to be lifted from the album. It was composed by Mark Clarke and Ken Hensley. It is a gentle, semi-acoustic ballad whose lyrics deal with a man wandering until he meets "the Wizard of a thousand kings", a possible reference to the druid Merlin, to Gandalf, to an angel, to a bodhisattva, or even God. This song is the first Uriah Heep single which had a music video. The song was composed by keyboardist-guitarist Ken Hensley and the band's short time bassist Mark Clarke. "The Wizard" also was the only composition that includes Clarke as a member of the band. The song charted at #34 in Germany and at #8 in Switzerland.
