Trot (music)
Trot (트로트, RR: teuroteu), also known by the onomatopoetic term Ppongjjak (뽕짝), is a genre of Korean popular music, known for its use of repetitive rhythm and vocal inflections. Originating in Korea during Japanese colonial rule in the first half of the 20th century, Trot was influenced by many genres of Korean, Japanese, U.S. and European music.Trot genre has been around for almost 100 years and its distinct singing style has been continuously changing. Trot music got its shape in rhythms during Japanese colonial rule. After the liberation of the Korean peninsula and the Korean War (1950-1953), talented artists such as Lee Mi-Ja, Choi Sook-ja, Bae Ho, Nam Jin, Na Hun-a, Joo Hyun-mi and many others helped to make Trot popular. With the rise of K-Pop from the 1990s onwards, Trot music lost some popularity and was viewed as more old-fashioned. However, from 2000s onwards, young Trot singers such as Jang Yoon-jeong, Hong Jin-young, and K-pop singers such as Super Junior-T, Daesung, and Lizzy, renewed interest in the genre and popularised it among young listeners.Although the genre originated before the division of the Korean peninsula, Trot is now mainly sung in South Korea; the associated pop culture in North Korea
