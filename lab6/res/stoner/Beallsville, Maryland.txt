Darby Store The Darby Store is located at the intersection of Beallsville and Darnestown roads. It is a historic and cultural landmark. In the mid-1800s the site of Darby store was occupied by a small blacksmith store and shop. However, in 1908, the shop was demolished after Harry C. Darby bought the land. By 1910, Darby built the ​2 1⁄2-story general store where local residents bought supplies and picked up mail. Darby store closed in 1974, and remained fully intact until a tractor-trailer destroyed the front porch in the late 1980s. In 2004, the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission bought the Store and Darby house for $670,000, a year after the Montgomery Preservation nonprofit agency declared the building “one of the county’s most endangered historic sites.” Julie Mueller, cultural resources planner for Montgomery County claimed that the structure would be moved back from the corner next year. During the summer of 2009, the site was under excavation. A team of archaeologists spent three weeks at the site and their findings included; oyster shells, glass shards, coal, nails, ceramic pipe
