Selenium monochloride
Selenium monochloride is an inorganic compound with the formula Se2Cl2. Although it is called selenium monochloride, a more descriptive name might be diselenium dichloride. It is a reddish-brown, oily liquid that hydrolyses slowly. It exists in chemical equilibrium with SeCl2, SeCl4, chlorine, and elemental selenium. Selenium monochloride is mainly used as a reagent for the synthesis of Se-containing compounds. Structure and properties Selenium monochloride has the connectivity Cl-Se-Se-Cl. With a nonplanar structure, it has C2 molecular symmetry, similar to hydrogen peroxide and sulfur monochloride. The Se-Se bond length is 2.23 Å, and the Se-Cl bond lengths are 2.20 Å. The dihedral angle is 87°. Preparation Selenium monochloride was originally produced by the chlorination of selenium. An improved method involves the reaction of a mixture of selenium, selenium dioxide, and hydrochloric acid: 3 Se + SeO2 + 4 HCl → 2 Se2Cl2 + H2OA dense layer of selenium monochloride settles from the reaction mixture, which can be purified by dissolving it in fuming sulfuric acid and reprecipitating it with hydrochloric acid. A second method for the synthesis involves the reaction of selenium with oleum and hydrochloric acid: 2 Se + 2 SO3 + 3 HCl → Se2Cl2 + H2SO3 + SO2(OH)ClThe
