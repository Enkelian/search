Adams Memorial
The Adams Memorial is a proposed United States presidential memorial to honor the second President John Adams; his wife and prolific writer, Abigail Adams; their son, the sixth President, John Quincy Adams; John Quincy Adams' wife, Louisa Catherine Adams; and other members of the Adams family. The memorial would also honor John Quincy Adam's son, Charles Francis Adams, Sr., a Civil War diplomat, politician, and editor; and Charles' two sons, Henry Adams, a noted historian and autobiographer, and academician Brooks Adams. The United States Congress authorized the Adams Memorial Foundation to proceed with the design and construction of a memorial on November 5, 2001. The foundation was authorized to raise private funds to construct a memorial on federal land in Washington, D.C. Once established, the memorial was then to be turned over to the federal government. On December 2, 2002, Congress amended this legislation to permit the Adams Memorial to be constructed within "Area 1", the central core of the District of Columbia centered on the National Mall.The Commemorative Works Clarification and Revision Act of 2003 (CWCRA), however, gave the Adams Memorial Foundation and other memorial efforts then under way just seven years to raise the funds and begin construction.
