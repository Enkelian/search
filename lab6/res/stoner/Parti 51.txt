Parti 51
Parti 51 is a minor political party in the Canadian province of Quebec that was founded in the late 1980s under the leadership of Serge Talon. The party proposed the separation of Quebec from Canada in order to seek admission to the United States as the 51st state of that union. The party had no success in winning any seat in 1989 election to the National Assembly of Quebec, and in the spring of 1990, asked the Direction of Elections of Quebec to dissolve the party because it no longer had enough members to form an executive committee.In 2016, the party was relaunched by a Saint-Georges-based lawyer, Hans Mercier. History In 2016, Saint-Georges lawyer Hans Mercier re-launched Parti 51, again calling for the annexation of Quebec. By the time of the 2018 election, the party had an estimated 1,100 members. Mercier told La Presse that the times have changed since the party's previous era, as Quebec sovereigntism has waned in popularity. Mercier argued that Americans would be welcoming of a new Quebec state, and pointed to a survey taken during the Administration of George W. Bush that suggested nearly 34% of Quebecers would support joining the United States. Election results
