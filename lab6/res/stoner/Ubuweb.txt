It offers visual, concrete and sound poetry, expanding to include film and sound art mp3 archives. Philosophy UbuWeb was founded in response to the marginal distribution of crucial avant-garde material. It remains non-commercial and operates on a gift economy.

It addresses problems in the distribution of and access to intellectual materials.
