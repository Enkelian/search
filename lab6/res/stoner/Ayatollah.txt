Ayatollah
An ayatollah (UK: or US: ; Persian: آيت‌الله‎, romanized: āyatullāh, from Arabic: آية الله‎, romanized: ʾāyatu llāh "Sign of God") or ayatullah is a high-ranking Usuli Twelver Shī‘ah cleric. Those who carry the title are experts in Islamic studies such as jurisprudence, Quran reading, and philosophy and usually teach in Islamic seminaries. The next lower clerical rank is Hujjat al-Islam.

Passage 51:20–21 of the Quran states: On the earth are signs (Ayat) for those of assured Faith, As also in your own selves: Will ye not then see? The term was not commonly used as a title until the early twentieth century. The title of Ayatollah became popularized with the creation of Qom Seminary in 1922. The title is currently granted to top Shia mujtahid, after completing sat'h and kharij studies in the hawza.
