2006–07 La Liga
The 2006–07 La Liga season, the 76th since its establishment, started on 27 August 2006 and finished on 17 June 2007. Real Madrid won La Liga on the better head to head against Barcelona in one of its most thrilling seasons to date. Celta de Vigo, Real Sociedad and Gimnàstic de Tarragona were relegated. Barcelona was in first place for much of the season while arch-rivals Real Madrid were six points behind and in fourth. However, Barcelona began playing inconsistently after January, while Madrid's form improved in that same period. On 12 May 2007, Real Madrid took the league lead for the first time all season by defeating Espanyol 4–3, coming back from 3–1 first half deficit. The Sunday after Madrid won their epic battle with Espanyol, Barcelona dropped points with a 1–1 draw to struggling Real Betis. By virtue of their superior head to head record, Madrid sat at the top of La Liga with both teams having four league games left.[1] On the penultimate day of the season, Barcelona failed to overcome city rivals Espanyol in the Barcelona derby, drawing 2–2. In the final La Liga matches, Barcelona thrashed Gimnàstic 5–1, but Madrid came back from a 1–0
