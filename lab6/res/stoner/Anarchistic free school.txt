Anarchistic free school
Autonomous social centers are self-organized community centers in which anti-authoritarians put on voluntary activities. These self-managed spaces, often in multi-purpose venues affiliated with anarchism, can include bicycle workshops, infoshops, libraries, free schools, free shops, meeting spaces and concert venues. They often become political actors in their own right. The centers are found worldwide, for example in Italy, the United States and the United Kingdom. They are inspired by various left-wing movements including anarchism and intentional communities. They are squatted, rented, or owned cooperatively. Uses Autonomous social centers vary in size and function depending on local context. Uses might include an infoshop, a radical bookshop, a resource centre offering advice, a hacklab, a caf√©, a bar, an affordable gig space, independent cinema or a housing co-operative. As well as providing a space for activities, these social centers can become protest actors in local issues such as gentrification or megaprojects. Alongside protest camps, social centers are projects in which the commons are created and practiced.

Some of these community sites include Wobbly union halls (1910s, 1920s), Barcelonan community
