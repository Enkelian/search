The theater teaches and hosts performances of improvisational comedy. It was founded in 1981 by Del Close and Charna Halpern. The theater has many notable alumni, including Amy Poehler and Stephen Colbert.

The Chris Farley Cabaret - One of two cabaret-style theaters in the building, this hosts many different types of performances, mostly improvised and mostly non-Harold.
