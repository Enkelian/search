Chocolate and Ice
Chocolate and Ice is an EP from Louisville, Kentucky indie rock band My Morning Jacket. It was released on March 26, 2002 by Badman Recording Co. All the songs on the EP were written and performed by band leader Jim James, and no other band members appear on the album, with the exception of the track "It's Been a Great 3 Or 4 Years", a voicemail from his cousin, guitarist John McQuade (Johnny Quaid). The inside packaging indicates the album was mastered at Abbey Road Studios. Songs such as "Sooner" and "Cobra" have become live favorites in the years since the EP's release, but songs such as "Sweetheart" have only been performed once, at Gypsy Team Room in Dallas, in 2006; while "Can You See The Hard Helmet On My Head?" is yet to be played by the band as of 2015. Three of the album's songs also appeared on the Sweatbees EP. Track listing All songs by Jim James.
