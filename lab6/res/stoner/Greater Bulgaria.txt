Greater Bulgaria
Greater Bulgaria is a term to identify the territory associated with a historical national state and a modern Bulgarian irredentist nationalist movement which would include most of Macedonia, Thrace and Moesia. History The larger proposed Bulgarian state was suggested under the Treaty of San Stefano. The issue of irredentism and nationalism gained greater prominence after the 1878 Treaty of San Stefano. It established the Principality of Bulgaria, with territory including the plain between the Danube and the Balkan mountain range (Stara Planina), the region of Sofia, Pirot and Vranje in the Morava valley, Northern Thrace, parts of Eastern Thrace and nearly all of Macedonia. This treaty laid grounds for much of the later claims for a Greater Bulgaria. However, the Treaty of San Stefano was a preliminary one and the borders of the newly created Bulgaria were established in the Treaty of Berlin. It saw the previous territory divided in three â€“ the Principality of Bulgaria, the autonomous province of Eastern Rumelia, and Macedonia, which remained under Ottoman control and both were at the time with population with Bulgarian majority. In the early 20th century control over Macedonia was a key point of contention between Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria, Greece, and
