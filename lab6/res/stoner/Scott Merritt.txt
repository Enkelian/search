However, the album was not particularly successful, and Merritt began to pursue a more rock-oriented sound.He signed to Duke Street Records in 1985. The label rereleased Serious Interference in early 1986, released his song "Transistor" as a single, and sent him out on tour as an opening act for Jane Siberry. He followed up later the same year with his third album Gravity Is Mutual, which was produced by Roma Baran and included guest contributions by Adrian Belew. That album's lead single, "Overworked and Underprivileged", became Merritt's most successful song on radio.In 1990 his fourth album, Violet and Black, was released on Duke Street in Canada
