Legacy Adam Bunch of Crawdaddy! wrote in 2007: "Silver Apples is a record that reached far ahead of its time. It's not surprising then, in a year when the airwaves were still dominated by Motown and the Beatles (whose experimentation was tame by comparison), that it failed to garner much of an audience. Even now, nearly forty years later, the record sounds fresh and unconventional – in 1968 there simply wasn't anything else like it." The Vinyl Factory included the record as one of the best electronic albums of the 1950s and 1960s, calling the album "a stunning collection of rickety electronic grooves and hydraulic wheezes," noting that "the compositions are often harmonically static, giving the record a driving, hypnotic quality. There’s not a bum track on it."The track "Oscillations" placed at number 119
