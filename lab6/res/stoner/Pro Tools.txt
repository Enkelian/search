Pro Tools
Pro Tools is a digital audio workstation developed and released by Avid Technology (formerly Digidesign) for Microsoft Windows and macOS used for music creation and production, sound for picture (sound design, audio post-production and mixing) and, more generally, sound recording, editing and mastering processes. Pro Tools can run as standalone software or operate using a range of external analog/digital converters and internal PCIe cards with on-board digital signal processors (DSP), used to provide additional processing power to the host computer to process real-time effects—such as reverb, equalization and compression— and to obtain lower latency audio performance. Like all digital audio workstation software, Pro Tools can perform the functions of a multitrack tape recorder and a mixing console along with additional features that can only be performed in the digital domain, such as non-linear and non-destructive editing—most of audio handling is done without overwriting the source files—, track compositing with multiple playlists, and faster-than-realtime mixdown. Audio, MIDI and video tracks are graphically represented in a timeline. Audio effects, virtual instruments and hardware emulators—such as microphone preamps or guitar amplifiers—can be added, adjusted and processed in real-time in a virtual mixer. 16-bit, 24-bit, and 32-bit float audio bit depths at sample rates
