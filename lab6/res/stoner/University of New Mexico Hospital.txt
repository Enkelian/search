University of New Mexico Hospital
The University of New Mexico Hospital (locally known as either University Hospital, UNM Hospital, or shortened to UNMH) is a public teaching hospital located in Albuquerque, New Mexico, immediately north of the main campus of the University of New Mexico. The hospital is the only Level I trauma center in the state of New Mexico, and also houses the only certified burn unit and designated stroke center in the state. In addition, UNMH also contains the only children's hospital in New Mexico, and is the state's sole source of 13 pediatric sub-specialties. As a safety net hospital, UNMH serves a large percentage of the uninsured and under-insured population of the state. The hospital is the main teaching facility for the University of New Mexico School of Medicine. History The hospital's origins date back to 1952, when Bernalillo County and the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) entered into an agreement to manage the construction of a hospital that would serve both the citizens of the county and the significant Native American population in the surrounding region. As part of the agreement, the BIA donated 5.3 acres of federal land to the county, upon which the hospital would be built. Bernalillo County
