Mel Galley
Melville John "Mel" Galley (8 March 1948 â€“ 1 July 2008) was an English guitarist and singer, best known for his work with Whitesnake, Trapeze, Finders Keepers and Phenomena. Galley was born in Cannock, Staffordshire, England. While a member of Whitesnake, he badly injured his arm in an accident at a fairground in Germany and had to leave the band, as he was unable to play the guitar because of nerve damage as a result of incompetent surgery. Later he became known for playing with "The Claw", a specially developed spring and wire device fitted to his hand which enabled him to play the guitar again. Together with his brother Tom Galley and Wilfried Rimensberger, he was a founding member of Phenomena where his songwriting and guitar playing skills had a major impact on its success. On 7 February 2008 Galley revealed that he was suffering from esophageal cancer, and had only a short time to live."I have been very lucky.
