Content This song portrays the message of self-forgiveness by explaining three separate incidents as examples. The song's narrator first reflects on his admitted bullying of a child who was physically different from him and other children who attended the same elementary school. The narrator secondly reflects on a relationship with a significant other in high school which he abruptly ends as a result of his senseless self-pleasure, inflicting severe emotional abuse to his significant other in the process. The narrator finally reveals that the hurt that he caused to the people he had previously mentioned in the song eventually stemmed into a deep loathing of himself.
