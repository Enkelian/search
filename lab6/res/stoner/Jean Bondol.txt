Jean Bondol
Jean Bondol, also known as Jean de Bruges or Jan Baudolf, was the author of the illuminations in a translation of the Vulgate which was presented to Charles V of France by his valet Jehan Vaudetar. It is now in the Westreen Museum at the Hague, a museum which contains many interesting missals of a similar character. These illuminations were executed in the year 1371, a period when art in the Netherlands was making rapid advances beyond the conventionality of the early 14th century, and the work of Jean de Bruges is by no means behind that of his contemporaries. He also produced a number of designs for tapestries. References This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Bryan, Michael (1886). "Bruges, Jean de".
