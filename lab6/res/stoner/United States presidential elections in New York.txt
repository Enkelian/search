United States presidential elections in New York
Following is a table of United States presidential elections in New York, ordered by year. Since its admission to statehood in 1788, New York has participated in every U.S. presidential election except the election of 1788-89, when it failed to appoint its allotment of eight electors because of a deadlock in the state legislature.

Elections from 1864 to present Election of 1860 The election of 1860 was a complex realigning election in which the breakdown of the previous two-party alignment culminated in four parties each competing for influence in different parts of the country.

Elections from 1828 to 1856 Election of 1824 The election of 1824 was a complex realigning election following the collapse of the prevailing Democratic-Republican Party, resulting in four different candidates each claiming to carry the banner of the party, and competing for influence in different parts of the country.
