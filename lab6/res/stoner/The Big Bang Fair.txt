The Big Bang Fair
The Big Bang UK Young Scientists and Engineers Fair is the United Kingdom’s largest celebration of STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) for young people, and is one of the largest youth events in the UK. The fair takes place annually in March. It is led by EngineeringUK in partnership with over 200 organisations across government, industry, education and the wider science and engineering community. The Big Bang programme exists to bring science and engineering to life for young people. The Big Bang celebrates and raises the profile of young people’s achievements in science and engineering and encourages more young people to take part in science, technology, engineering and maths initiatives with support from their parents and teachers. Big Bang Near Me events take place across the UK to enable young people to discover close to home the exciting and rewarding science and engineering careers that their science and maths subjects can lead to. In 2012, the Big Bang Fair was hosted in the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham. An all-girls team of pupils from a state school in the Highlands- Alness Academy were awarded the prestigious title of UK Young Engineers of the Year for their work on health
