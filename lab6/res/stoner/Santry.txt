Santry
Santry (Irish: Seantrabh, meaning "Old tribe") is a suburb on the northside of Dublin, Ireland, bordering Coolock, Glasnevin, Kilmore and Ballymun. It straddles the boundary of Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council jurisdictions. The character of the area has changed in the last 100 years, from a district centred on a large estate, and later small village, to a modern, rather dispersed, mixed-use suburb. Much of the old village is gone and where there were once fields full of crops, and wild woodlands of all sorts, there are now housing estates, an athletics stadium, a shopping complex, industrial parks and busy roads leading to Dublin Airport. Trinity College Library has a depository at Santry which holds three million books.Santry is also the name of a civil parish in the ancient barony of Coolock. History Santry is an anglicisation of the Irish placename Seantrabh (pronounced Shan-treev) which literally means "old tribe". Although not verified, the book of Leccan refers to a tribe called the Almanii who inhabited the area, which might have been the source of the name. During the Viking invasions a number of peaceful Norse farmers moved into the north Dublin area, which proved to be excellent farmland.
