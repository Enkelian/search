Brave Belt
Brave Belt was a Canadian rock band from Winnipeg, Manitoba originally consisting of Randy Bachman (guitar/vocals), his former Guess Who bandmate, Chad Allan (vocals/keyboards), and Randy's brother Robbie (drums). Randy also provided bass tracks for the recording of the band's first album, Brave Belt (Reprise Records, 1971). But C. F. "Fred" Turner was added shortly after as bassist for the supporting concerts.The band made the Canadian Top 40 with the minor hit "Crazy Arms, Crazy Eyes," which peaked at #35 in November 1971. However, they missed the U.S. charts completely. In 1972, Turner became the lead vocalist for the Brave Belt II album. Allan left the band after the recording was completed. During the supporting concerts for Brave Belt II, Tim Bachman was added as a second guitarist. Despite the changes, Brave Belt II sold poorly and the band struggled to book live shows. In a 1974 Rolling Stone interview, Randy estimated there were losses of about $150,000 in 1971-72 ($923,000 in 2020 dollars), with himself personally absorbing about 60% of the loss, as he was paying the other band member salaries from his Guess Who royalties.Although dropped from the Reprise label, the Brave Belt II lineup (C.
