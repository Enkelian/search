The Early Days of Guns N' Roses
The Early Days of Guns N' Roses was what the first series of concerts by American hard rock band Guns N' Roses are referred to as. Before embarking on the Appetite for Destruction Tour in 1987 after the group's breakthrough success, the band played at least 60 shows. After playing a few shows with early members (Guns, Beich and Gardner) on June 6, 1985 the band played their first show with what became known as the "classic line-up" of singer Axl Rose, guitarists Slash and Izzy Stradlin, bassist Duff McKagan and drummer Steven Adler. The band's trek on the West coast from June 6th to June 12th, 1985 became known as "The Hell Tour" due to the difficulties the band faced touring. Personnel Setlists Shows == References ==
