Shockadoom
Shockadoom is a 2002 EP by American hip hop group Freestyle Fellowship. Production After releasing Innercity Griots in 1993, Freestyle Fellowship went on hiatus due to the incarceration of Self Jupiter. In 1998, the group reunited and recorded Shockadoom, which was mostly produced by Omid. It was released in 2002, a year after the release of Temptations. Critical reception Robert Gabriel of AllMusic gave Shockadoom 3 stars out of 5, saying, "Mikah 9, Aceyalone, P.E.A.C.E., and Self Jupiter each present themselves at the top of their game throughout Shockadoom, with vocal styles that make it a point to capture both the present and the future by reviving past African-American musical traditions."
