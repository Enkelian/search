Spinal cancer
Spinal tumors are neoplasms located in either the vertebral column or the spinal cord. There are three main types of spinal tumors classified based on their location: extradural and intradural (intradural-intramedullary and intradural-extramedullary). Extradural tumors are located outside the dura mater lining and are most commonly metastatic. Intradural tumors are located inside the dura mater lining and are further subdivided into intramedullary and extramedullary tumors. Intradural-intramedullary tumors are located within the dura and spinal cord parenchyma, while intradural-extramedullary tumors are located within the dura but outside the spinal cord parenchyma. The most common presenting symptom of spinal tumors is nocturnal back pain. Other common symptoms include muscle weakness, sensory loss, and difficulty walking. Loss of bowel and bladder control may occur during the later stages of the disease.We do not know what causes spinal tumors. Most extradural tumors are metastatic commonly from breast, prostate, lung, and kidney cancer. There are many genetic factors associated with intradural tumors, most commonly neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1), neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2), and Von-Hippel Lindau (VHL) syndrome. The most common type of intradural-extramedullary tumors are meningiomas and nerve-sheath tumors. The most common type of intradural-intramedullary tumors are ependymomas and astrocytomas. Diagnosis involves a complete medical evaluation followed
