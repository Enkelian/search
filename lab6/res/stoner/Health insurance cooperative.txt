Health insurance cooperative
A health insurance cooperative is a cooperative entity that has the goal of providing health insurance and is also owned by the people that the organization insures. It is a form of mutual insurance. United States In the debate over healthcare reform, healthcare cooperatives are posited as an alternative to both publicly funded healthcare and single-payer healthcare.

As proposed by President Obama and others, a future health insurance cooperative would not be government owned or run, but would instead receive an initial government investment and would then be operated as a non-profit organization.While a health insurance co-op is not strictly run by the government, hence not making it a public entity, it has been described by Senator Max Baucus of Montana, who is also the chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Finance as "tough enough to keep insurance companiesâ€™ feet to the fire." He has proposed a bill that includes a health insurance cooperative instead
