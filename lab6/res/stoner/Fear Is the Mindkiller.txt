Fear Is the Mindkiller
Fear Is the Mindkiller is a remix EP containing remixes of songs from the first album Soul of a New Machine by Fear Factory. It was released on April 14, 1993 by Roadrunner Records. Content Remixes 1-5 were remixed by Rhys Fulber and Bill Leeb of Front Line Assembly. The EP was remastered and re-released on October 5, 2004 in a digipak, packaged together with the remastered Soul of a New Machine without Self Immolation. The title of the record is a quote from "Litany against fear", a fictional incantation from Dune, the science fiction novel written by Frank Herbert. When playing live in the 1990s, the band would occasionally play a variation of the Deep Dub Trauma remix of Scumgrief, rather than the original. Track listing Personnel Fear Factory Burton C.
