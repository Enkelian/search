John Michael David Coey (born 24 February 1945), known as Michael Coey, is a Belfast-born experimental physicist working in the fields of magnetism and spintronics. He got a BA in Physics at Jesus College, Cambridge (1966), and a PhD from University of Manitoba (1971) for a thesis on "Mössbauer Effect of 57Fe in Magnetic Oxides" with advisor Allan H. Morrish. Trinity College Dublin (TCD), where he has been in the physics department since 1978, awarded him ScD (1987) and the University of Grenoble awarded him Dip. d'Habilitation (1986) and an honorary doctorate (1994). He served as Erasmus Smith's Professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy at TCD from 2007 to 2012. Career Mike Coey has been a Professor of Physics at TCD since 1987, and was the last appointed Erasmus Smith's Professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy (2007–2012), a chair that dates from 1724. He has supervised over 50 PhD students, and authored or edited 5 volumes. Recognised as a distinguished European specialist in magnetic materials; internationally he continues to be a leader in the field of magnetism.In 1994 Coey founded Magnetic Solutions and went on to be the cofounder of CRANN Ireland's Nanoscience Research institute (2002) and conceived Dublin's unique
