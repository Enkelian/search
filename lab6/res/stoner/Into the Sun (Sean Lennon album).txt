Into the Sun (Sean Lennon album)
Into the Sun is the debut album by Sean Lennon, released on May 19, 1998 on the Beastie Boys' label Grand Royal (distributed by Capitol Records, a division of EMI which had been the longtime home of Sean's father John Lennon). Background It was released during his time performing with Cibo Matto along with girlfriend Yuka Honda, who also produced and performed on the album. The album was engineered and mixed by Tom Schick at Sear Sound. Sean has said it was "inspired by my girlfriend". Into the Sun peaked at #153 on the Billboard 200. A voice on the final track, "Sean's Theme", which softly speaks "Goodnight, Sean", is sometimes mistakenly attributed to father John Lennon; however, it is, in fact, that of Walter Sear, an owner of Sear Sound. Sean has said it is in tribute to his father, whose tribute to Sean, "Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy)" closes with "Goodnight, Sean. See you in the morning, bright and early."
