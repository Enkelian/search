1999–2000 Scottish Cup
The 1999–2000 Scottish Cup was the 115th staging of Scotland's most prestigious football knockout competition, also known for sponsorship reasons as the Tennent's Scottish Cup. The Cup was won by Rangers who defeated Aberdeen 4–0 in the final. Probably one of the biggest shocks of the tournament was when at the time First Division Inverness Caledonian Thistle beat Premiership club Celtic F.C. 3-1 inspiring the famous headline in The Sun "SuperCaleyGoBallisticCelticAreAtrocious" the next day.
