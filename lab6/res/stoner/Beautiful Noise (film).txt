Beautiful Noise (film)
Beautiful Noise is a 2014 American music documentary film, written and directed by Eric Green. The film documents three rock bands—Cocteau Twins, The Jesus and Mary Chain, and My Bloody Valentine—and their influence on shoegazing and other alternative rock genres. Beautiful Noise features extracts from over 50 interviews with bands and artists, as well as archival footage and music videos. Green commenced production on Beautiful Noise in early 2005 with producer and editor Sarah Ogletree; production was largely completed by 2008 although the project stagnated due to various financial and legal issues.

The campaign was supported by several of the bands featured in Beautiful Noise through social media. Beautiful Noise was announced for release in May 2014 and premiered at the Seattle International Film Festival in Seattle, Washington on May 31, 2014.
