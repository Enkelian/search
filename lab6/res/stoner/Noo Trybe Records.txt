Noo Trybe Records
Noo Trybe Records is an American hip hop record label established in 1994 and operated as a sublabel of Virgin Records. It was the distributor of several independent hip hop labels including Rap-A-Lot Records and AWOL. A portion of Noo Trybe's roster came from several artists who were absorbed from EMI when it was disbanded, which included Gang Starr and AZ. Other Virgin acts such as Shyheim, who signed with the label in 1993, were transferred to the new label. One of the label's biggest successes was the group Luniz. Rap-A-Lot's distribution was absorbed by Virgin proper in 1998, and in 1999, the label was absorbed by its parent.
