Texas State Highway Loop 1604
Loop 1604, also known as the Charles W. Anderson Loop, is an outer highway loop that encircles San Antonio, Texas, spanning approximately 95.6 miles (153.9 km). What began as a two-lane highway has been upgraded to a four-lane freeway along its northern stretches from US Hwy 90 on the West to Kitty Hawk Rd on the East. The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) is planning to further upgrade this freeway segment from 4 general purpose lanes to 8 general purpose lanes and 2 HOV lanes from Bandera Rd to I-35. Loop 1604 is named for former Bexar County Judge Charles W. Anderson, who died from cancer in 1964 after serving for 25 years on the bench. History Loop 1604 was designated on June 30, 1977 after FM 1604 was combined with a large portion of FM 1518 to complete a larger loop around San Antonio. Three bypasses were completed in the early 1980s: on December 12, 1979, FM 1937 was extended to replace a bypassed portion near Losoya; on March 3, 1981, FM 327 was designated as the through route when Loop 1604 was rerouted around Elmendorf; and in 1983 Loop 1604 was routed around Lone Oak, creating FM 3465
