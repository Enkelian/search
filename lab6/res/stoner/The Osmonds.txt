The Osmonds
The Osmonds are an American family music group who reached the height of their fame in the early-to-mid 1970s. Currently consisting of a duo of original members Merrill Osmond and Jay Osmond, the group's best known configurations have been as a quartet (billed as the Osmond Brothers) and as a quintet (as the Osmonds). The group has consisted of siblings who are all members of a family of musicians from Ogden, Utah, who have been in the public eye since the 1960s.The Osmond Brothers began as a barbershop quartet consisting of brothers Alan, Wayne, Merrill and Jay. They were later joined by younger siblings Donny and Jimmy, both of whom enjoyed success as solo artists as well. With the addition of Donny, the group became known as the Osmonds; performing both as teen idols and as a soft rock band, their peak lasted from 1971 to 1975. Their only sister Marie, who rarely sang with her brothers at that time, launched a successful career in 1973, both as a solo artist and as Donny's duet partner. By 1976, the band was no longer producing hit singles; that year, they transitioned into television with Donny & Marie, a popular variety show
