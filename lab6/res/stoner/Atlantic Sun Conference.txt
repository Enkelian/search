Atlantic Sun Conference
The Atlantic Sun Conference, branded as the ASUN Conference, is a collegiate athletic conference operating mostly in the Southeastern United States. The league participates at the NCAA Division I level, and does not sponsor football. Originally established as the Trans America Athletic Conference (TAAC) in 1978, its headquarters are located in Macon, Georgia. The conference has seen several changes in its membership in recent years. First, the 2014 departure of East Tennessee State University and Mercer University to the Southern Conference left the ASUN with eight members. Northern Kentucky University (transitioning from NCAA Division II sports to Division I) left the conference to join the Horizon League and was replaced by the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), previously the only Division I basketball independent, in 2015. The ASUN membership expanded to nine members in 2018. The University of South Carolina Upstate (USC Upstate) left the ASUN to join the Big South Conference after the 2017–18 season, but two new schools joined. The University of North Alabama arrived from the Division II Gulf South Conference, and Liberty University left the Big South for the ASUN.The ASUN's next change of membership will occur in 2020–21 with the arrival of Bellarmine University
