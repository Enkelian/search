Coolmine Community School
Coolmine Community School (Scoil Pobail Chúil Mhín in Irish) is a co-educational secondary school located in the Coolmine suburb of Dublin. It lies within Greater Blanchardstown in the administration of Fingal. History The school was one of the two first community schools founded in the Republic of Ireland, in 1972, and was officially blessed and opened in 1974. This Community School was established by the State after considerable discussion between a local Parents' Committee, the Department of Education, the VEC and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin, with a view to integrating the traditional academic / classical approach of the secondary schools with the vocational / industrial tradition of the vocational schools. Operations The school caters for over 1200 pupils, both boys and girls, aged from 12 to 19 years, who live mainly within a geographically defined catchment area. The premises includes a sports and leisure complex with an indoor heated swimming pool. The Community Development and Adult Education Day and Evening Programmes cater annually for some 2000 persons. The school crest embodies a stylised version of Crois Bhríde / St. Brigid's Cross with the early Irish symbol of the Holy Trinity, surrounded by the "C" of Community and underlined
