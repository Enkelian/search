1986 Los Angeles Raiders season
The 1986 Los Angeles Raiders season was their 27th in the league. They were unable to improve upon the previous season's output of 12â€“4, winning only eight games. The team failed to qualify for the playoffs for the first time in five seasons. The 1986 season was marked by highly competitive games (only four of the Raiders' sixteen regular season games were decided by more than a touchdown). The campaign also marked the end of storied quarterback Jim Plunkett's career. After starting the season 0-3, the Raiders proceeded to win eight of their next nine games before losing their final four games to miss the playoffs.
