Lambuth University
Lambuth University was a liberal arts university in Jackson, Tennessee. It was active from 1843 to 2011 and was supported by the Memphis Annual Conference of the United Methodist Church. The university began as the Memphis Conference Female Institute in 1843 and was later renamed in honor of Walter Russell Lambuth (1854–1921), a Methodist missionary who traveled globally. Lambuth's athletic teams participated in the NAIA's TranSouth and Mid-South Conferences. After several years of financial struggles, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools opted not to renew Lambuth's accreditation in 2011. Due to both the financial and accreditation problems, the Board of Trustees voted in April 2011 to cease operations two months later. Final commencement exercises were held April 30, 2011. The University of Memphis acquired the campus which is now the Lambuth branch campus of the University of Memphis.
