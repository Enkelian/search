University of Toulouse-Jean Jaurès
University of Toulouse-Jean Jaurès (French: Université Toulouse-Jean Jaurès) has been known by this name since 2014. Formerly called Université de Toulouse-Le Mirail or UTM, it is one of 3 universities in Toulouse, France. The campus, situated in Toulouse's grand architectural project of the 1960s, Le Mirail, was conceived and built by the team of architects Candilis, Josic, Woods. Mirail University was hastily conceived as a result of the saturation of the original buildings in the city centre and the events of May 1968. At that time it was decided to divide the University of Toulouse into three: The law faculty became Université Toulouse I, occupying all the old university buildings, the humanities faculty became Université de Toulouse II – Le Mirail, named after its new location, and the departments of science and medicine became Université Paul Sabatier (Toulouse III). In 1969, a fourth university in Toulouse was created, Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse, a school of engineering. After the opening of many extensions (one of which was situated in military barracks) in order to free up the university in the city centre, the campus in Le Mirail opened one section at a time starting in 1971, and completed the transfer
