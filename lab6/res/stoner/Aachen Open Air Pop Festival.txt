Aachen Open Air Pop Festival
The Aachen Open Air Pop Festival was a rock festival held at Hauptstadion in Aachen, Germany, on 10–12 July 1970. The "Soersfestival", as it is commonly called, was the initiative of three local students: Golo Goldschmitt, Walter Reiff, and Karl-August Hohmann in particular. As there were many hippies and freaks to be expected from all over Europe, the organisers had to tackle considerable difficulties and hostilities to crack on with the idea. Some 30.-40,000 visitors attended. The Festival was well-organised, the weather was fine and no real problems occurred in spite of a massive and intimidating cop presence. Coca-Cola was the main investor, along with some local entrepreneurs. Tickets cost DM 15,- , or DM 40,- for three days. Artists who ultimately declined invitations, included Ginger Baker's Air Force, Canned Heat, Donovan, Fat Mattress, John Lennon & the Plastic Ono Band, John Mayall, Rhinoceros, The Rolling Stones and Soft Machine.
