Alt Nation
Alt Nation is an alternative rock radio station on Sirius XM Radio channel 36 and on Dish Network channel 6036. Alt Nation was formed in 2002, when Sirius Satellite Radio launched. Some 1970s songs were played on the channel, such as AC/DC's "Highway To Hell", until February 2009, when the playlist was reduced to 1990s/2000s alternative rock. However, since the spring of 2009, Alt Nation dropped most of the 1990s alternative rock, leaving most of the 1990s playlist to Lithium. The only 1990s song remaining on Alt Nation's playlist is "Stellar" by Incubus, from their 1999 album Make Yourself. Alt Nation has become known for breaking new bands into the alternative rock radio scene. For example, Alt Nation was the first alternative-rock station to play Phoenix's "1901" and Foster the People's "Pumped Up Kicks", both of which went to No. 1 on the Alternative Rock chart.
