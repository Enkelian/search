Nvision
Nvision, stylized as NVISION, is a stand-alone event organized by NVIDIA to promote visual computing among enthusiasts and journalists. The event is mostly centered on NVIDIA's own products but offers activities usually found at other types of events: a demoscene event, scientific talks, and programming classes. It's been replaced by the GPU Technology Conference in following years. The same name was also used for Nvidia's quarterly magazine, published by Future plc. Publication was ceased after the 'Winter 2011' (#7) issue.
