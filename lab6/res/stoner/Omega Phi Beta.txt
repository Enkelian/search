Omega Phi Beta
Omega Phi Beta (ΩΦΒ) is a sorority founded on March 15, 1989 at the State University of New York in Albany, New York by seventeen women of diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds. It is a member organization of National Association of Latino Fraternal Organizations (NALFO). The sorority has undergraduate and alumnae chapters and colonies predominantly based on the East Coast. The organization has expanded into the Midwest, California, and South East in the recent years. The organization's goal, as its motto ("Serving and Educating Through Our Diversity") implies, is to create an outlet for all women through its emphasis on multiculturalism. The organization also concerns community service and sisterhood. OPBSI is Latina-oriented, not Latina-based, further emphasizing its dedication to diversity.
