Bernie Shaw
Bernard "Bernie" Shaw (born 15 June 1956 in Victoria, British Columbia) is a Canadian singer, and since 1986, the lead vocalist for the British rock group Uriah Heep. Career At the beginning of 1970 Shaw dreamed of becoming a rock guitarist. He bought himself a Gibson SG Special and started practicing. When the local band Cold Sweat was looking for a second guitarist in 1974, Shaw auditioned, but bass player Bill Kempster advised him to put down the guitar and to buy a mic from their old singer and come back the next week. Shaw followed up this advice, and when he auditioned as a singer the band hired him as their new vocalist. Cold Sweat toured extensively over the next three years, playing across British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and into Manitoba. Their live set of a mixture of classic melodic rock soon became their calling card on the hotel, and live club scene. The changing music scene and popularity of discos caused the Victoria band to break up in 1977. In that same year, he was called to join Saskatoon based band Legend, who had lost their lead singer Danny Jeans. They had heard Shaw singing with Cold Sweat
