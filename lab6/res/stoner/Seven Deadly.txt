Seven Deadly
Seven Deadly is the twentieth studio album by British hard rock band UFO, released on 27 February 2012. Reception Since its release, this album has been met with mostly positive reviews. Geoff Barton of Classic Rock found the album "bursting with creativity and athleticism" and praised Phil Mogg for the "vim and vigour" of his singing and for his "evocative and erudite" lyrics. He adds that the album has a "darker edge this time around" and may be the best possible swansong for UFO. Rebecca Miller of Metal Temple wrote, "Not contented to sit back on their laurels, the band continues to produce high quality rock albums and Seven Deadly is certainly no exception".
