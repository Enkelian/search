The Sunday Times (UK)
The Sunday Times is the largest-selling British national newspaper in the "quality press" market category. It is published by Times Newspapers Ltd, a subsidiary of News UK, which is in turn owned by News Corp. Times Newspapers also publishes The Times. The two papers were founded independently and have been under common ownership only since 1966. They were bought by News International in 1981. The Sunday Times occupies a dominant position in the quality Sunday market; its circulation of just over 650,000 exceeds that of its main rivals, the Sunday Telegraph and the Observer, combined. While some other national newspapers moved to a tabloid format in the early 2000s, The Sunday Times has retained the larger broadsheet format and has said that it will continue to do so. As of December 2019, it sells 75% more copies than its sister paper, The Times, which is published Monday to Saturday.The Sunday Times has acquired a reputation for the strength of its investigative reporting – much of it by its Insight team – and also for its wide-ranging foreign coverage. It has a number of popular writers, columnists and commentators including Jeremy Clarkson and Bryan Appleyard. A. A. Gill was a prominent
