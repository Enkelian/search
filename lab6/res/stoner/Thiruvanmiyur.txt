Thiruvanmiyur
Thiruvanmiyur is a largely residential neighborhood in the south of Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. Thiruvanmiyur witnessed a spike in its economy with the construction of Chennai's first dedicated technology office space, the Tidel Information Technology Park in neighboring Taramani. The subsequent rise of several information technology businesses, research centres and offices around Tidel park proved fortuitous for Thiruvanmiyur, as many of the workers at these offices often made Thiruvanmiyur their home. The Marundeeswarar Temple, dedicated to Shiva previously defined the area, leading it to be mentioned in Sangam Tamil epics. It is also commonly referred to as the MICO layout of Chennai city. Etymology The place might derives its name from Thiru-Valmiki-Ur, meaning location of the temple of Valmiki. This place was also referred to as Thiru-aamai-yur in the Sangam Literature. Which literally means city of turtles. This town's beach is an important turtle habitat.
