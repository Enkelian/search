Sumo (band)
Sumo was a 1980s Argentine alternative rock band, heavily influenced by post-punk and reggae. Led by Italian-born Luca Prodan, it remained underground for most of its short activity but was extremely influential in shaping contemporary Argentine rock. Sumo is credited with introducing British post-punk to the Argentine scene, mostly by songs with lyrics in English, and with providing a visceral counterpoint to the progressive and nueva canción influences then dominant in the country's rock en español. History Background Luca Prodan was born in Rome on 17 May 1953 of Italian and Scottish descent after his family returned from China: His father had set up a prosperous business in ancient Chinese pottery that became untenable after the Japanese invasion of China during World War II.In his youth, Luca was sent to prestigious Gordonstoun College in Scotland -- the same Prince Charles of England attended. He escaped Gordonstoun a year before graduation and moved to London soon after.In the 1970s London Luca worked at EMI and formed his first band, The New Clear Heads, which shared aesthetics with contemporary punk acts like XTC, The Fall, Joy Division (a name he later translated to Spanish for Sumo's first album Divididos por la Felicidad)
