In the Flesh (Blondie song)
"In the Flesh" is a song by American band Blondie. Originally from the band's self-titled debut album, Blondie, the song was Blondie's second and final single on the Private Stock label. Song information The song has a feel reminiscent of Phil Spector-produced pop from the early 60s, with prominent piano, female backing vocals, and a time signature of 12/8. In Australia, after the song was played by mistake (instead of "X Offender") on the nationally broadcast music program Countdown, it was well received by the viewing audience. Chrysalis Records re-released the song as a single in Australia, again with "Man Overboard" as the B-side. When it reached number two on the Kent Music Report in November 1977, Australia became the first territory in which Blondie achieved a hit single. "In the Flesh" was featured in the 1982 film The Last American Virgin. The song was also featured in the film 200 Cigarettes (1999) and A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master and was featured on the ABC show Wicked City. The song was covered by fictional band Low Shoulder in the 2009 film Jennifer's Body. Release history U.S. 7" (PS-45.141) / (PVT 1329 SP) "In the Flesh" (Harry
