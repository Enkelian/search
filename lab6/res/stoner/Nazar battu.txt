Nazar battu
A Nazar battu (Hindustani: नज़र बट्टू or نظر بٹو) is an icon, charm bracelet, tattoo or other object or pattern used in North India and Pakistan to ward-off the evil eye (or nazar). In Persian and Afghan folklore, it is called a cheshm nazar (Persian: چشم نظر‎) or nazar qurbāni (Persian: نظرقربانی‎). In India and Pakistan, the Hindi-Urdu slogan of Persian origin Chashm-e-Baddoor (Persian: چشم بد دور‎) is used to ward off the evil eye. Forms A nazar battu is often an intentional blemish or flaw that is introduced to prevent perfection. For instance, a black mark (kaala teeka in Hindi-Urdu, tor khaal in Pushto) might be made on the face or neck of a loved one. In houses, a deliberate flaw might be included in the otherwise-perfect physical appearance of the house. In expensive items such as carpets or saris, a deliberate coloring or stitching flaw is sometimes created. Amulets - some resembling the Turkish nazar boncuğu and others which are threads, sometimes with a taveez attached (a small cylinder that contains a prayer verse) - are common in the region. Some nazar battu amulets are region specific, for instance silver-mounted leopard nails which are used in the Chamba
