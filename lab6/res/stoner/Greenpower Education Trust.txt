Greenpower Education Trust
The Greenpower Education Trust is a charitable organisation, whose objective is to inspire more young people to become engineers by presenting the engineering industry as an interesting and relevant career choice which could help to solve problems relating to the personal, social and emotional development (known in Britain as PSED) of individuals and societies. The main idea is for teams of students between the ages of 9 and 25 to design, build, and race their own electric powered race cars on top racing circuits such as Goodwood. History The trust originated from a study by Sussex Chamber of Commerce in 1998 which considered the needs of engineering companies in that region. The investigation revealed low levels of interest in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (the so-called STEM school subjects). The Greenpower project started in 1999 to encourage students to design, build and race their own electric race cars within professionally drafted specifications and only a small helping hand from experienced adults. Events are organized for weekends at major motor circuits around the UK to facilitate attendance from the general public. Circuits include Goodwood, Castle Combe and Dunsfold (the Top Gear test track). Greenpower claims that it now works with 500
