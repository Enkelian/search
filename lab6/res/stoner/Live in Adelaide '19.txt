Live in Adelaide '19
Live in Adelaide '19 is the first in a trio of benefit live albums by Australian psychedelic rock band, King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard, which was released digitally to Bandcamp on 10 January 2020. It was released simultaneously with one other live album, Live in Paris '19. The third album Live in Brussels '19 was then released five days later. The album debuted at number six on the ARIA Albums Chart. Background The album features a set by the band performed at the Thebarton Theatre in Adelaide on 12 July 2019. Most of the tracks come from the band's later releases at the time; Infest the Rats' Nest, Fishing for Fishies, Flying Microtonal Banana, and Polygondwanaland. Two other tracks come from earlier releases like "Hot Water" from I'm in Your Mind Fuzz, and the album closer, a nearly half-hour rendition of "Head On/Pill" from Float Along â€“ Fill Your Lungs. The medley also featured elements of tracks from other releases such as "Hot Water", "Altered Beast", "Cellophane", "I'm in Your Mind", "Am I in Heaven?" and "Rattlesnake". All of the proceeds will go to Animals Australia in response to the 2019-2020 Australian bushfires. Track listing Personnel King Gizzard &
