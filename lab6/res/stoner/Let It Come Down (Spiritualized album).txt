Let It Come Down (Spiritualized album)
Let It Come Down is the fourth album by the rock band Spiritualized, released in 2001. It was recorded and produced at Abbey Road and AIR Studios. It took Jason Pierce, Spiritualized's lead singer, guitarist and sole constant member four years to write, perform, produce and release. The album utilises 115 session musicians, including orchestra and London Community Gospel Choir. The wall of sound technique (most notably used by 1960s record producer Phil Spector) is evident on this album, especially on such tracks as "Do It All Over Again", "Stop Your Crying", "The Straight and the Narrow" and "Out of Sight". Background Let It Come Down is unusual amongst Spiritualized's other releases in that it doesn't utilise many of the band's usual trademarks, such as guitar effects pedals, free jazz and drones, being a mostly orchestral work. However, it was not unexpected â€“ the album was preceded by the lush soundscapes of previous album Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space, and the live album released in 1998. Pierce also headlined the Edinburgh Flux Festival in 1998 and 1999 playing an orchestral set with a full choir, which hinted at the direction of Let It Come Down. Phil Spector
