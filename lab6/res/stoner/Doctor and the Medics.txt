The group's musical style includes neo-psychedelia, glam rock, new wave and pop rock.

The group adopted a look inspired by both 1960s psychedelia and kabuki make-up similar to that of Kiss. Their first single was "The Druids Are Here" which was released on Whaam Records in 1982. They released no further records until 1985, although a four track EP recorded live at Alice in Wonderland, a Soho nightclub where The Doctor was house DJ, was available direct
