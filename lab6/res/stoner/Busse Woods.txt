Busse Woods
Busse Woods is the second full-length album by the stoner metal band Acid King. The album was originally released in 1999 by Man's Ruin Records, but was reissued in 2004 with bonus tracks, by Small Stone Records, and on vinyl in 2007 by Kreation Records. The album's title (pronounced buss-ee) is the local name for the Ned Brown Forest Preserve, which is located near Chicago. As a teenager, frontwoman Lori S. often met there with friends who, according to the band's website, "...hung out with their trunks open, cranking tunes and selling drugs. After the cops caught on this era ended." The reissue of Busse Woods has slightly different artwork and two extra songs, cover versions of "Motorhead" by Hawkwind, and "Not Fragile" by Bachman-Turner Overdrive. These cover versions were released on the compilation albums Daze of the Underground and In the Groove respectively. "39 Lashes" is also a cover song, originally appearing on Jesus Christ Superstar, written by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice. Busse Woods was the only Acid King album with bass guitarist Brian Hill. Track listing (All songs written by Lori S. unless noted) "Electric Machine" – 6:25 "Silent Circle" – 7:30 "Drive Fast, Take Chances"
