Donavia
JSC "Donavia" (Russian: ОАО «Донавиа»), later Aeroflot-Don (Russian: ОАО «Аэрофлот-Дон»), was an Aeroflot subsidiary airline based in Rostov-on-Don, Russia. Its main bases were Rostov-on-Don Airport and Mineralnye Vody Airport after the Kavminvodyavia bankruptcy. In the spring of 2016, its operations were merged into sister company Rossiya. History The airline was established as Donavia following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. It absorbed the Rostov assets of the Soviet airline Aeroflot, and was one of many such "Babyflots" to emerge in the early 1990s. However, the airline was purchased by Aeroflot in 2000 and began to operate as Aeroflot-Don on 13 April 2000. It operated scheduled domestic and international passenger flights as well as passenger and cargo charters, mostly to the Middle East and within Russia. On 25 September 2009, the airline reverted to the Donavia brand name.
