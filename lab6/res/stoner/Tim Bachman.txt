Timothy Gregg Bachman (born August 1, 1951) is a Canadian guitarist and vocalist best known for his work with rock bands Brave Belt and Bachman–Turner Overdrive (BTO). Bachman was one of the four founding members of BTO, a group that have sold nearly 30 million albums worldwide and also featured his brothers Randy (guitar/vocals) and Robbie (drums), as well as Fred Turner (bass/vocals). Career Tim Bachman had played guitar in a few Winnipeg area bands, some with his younger brother Robbie on drums. He then briefly quit music, feeling that the Winnipeg scene had become stagnant, and he got a job and began attending college. He returned to music in 1972, when older brother Randy was looking to add a second guitar to the Brave Belt lineup. This occurred after the departure of Chad Allan, which left Brave Belt with only three members.Bachman wrote or co-wrote several songs during his tenure with Brave Belt and BTO, including "Put It in a Song" (with Turner) for the Brave Belt II album, "Down and Out Man" (with R. B. Charles) for the first BTO album, and "Blown" (with Randy) and "I Don't Have To Hide" for Bachman–Turner Overdrive II. Bachman left BTO
