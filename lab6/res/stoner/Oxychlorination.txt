Oxychlorination
In organic chemistry oxychlorination is a process for making C-Cl bonds. In contrast with direct use of Cl2, oxychlorination uses hydrogen chloride in combination with oxygen. This process is attractive industrially because hydrogen chloride is less expensive than chlorine. Mechanism The reaction is usually initiated by copper(II) chloride (CuCl2), which is the most common catalyst in the production of 1,2-dichloroethane. In some cases, CuCl2 is supported on silica in presence of KCl, LaCl3, or AlCl3 as cocatalysts. Aside from silica, a variety of supports have also been used including various types of alumina, diatomaceous earth, or pumice. Because this reaction is highly exothermic (238 kJ/mol), the temperature is monitored, to guard against thermal degradation of the catalyst. The reaction is as follows: CH2=CH2 + 2 CuCl2 → 2 CuCl + ClH2C-CH2ClThe copper(II) chloride is regenerated by sequential reactions of the cuprous chloride with oxygen and then hydrogen chloride: ½ O2 + 2 CuCl → CuOCuCl2 2 HCl + CuOCuCl2 → 2 CuCl2 + H2O Applications The most common substrate for this reaction is ethylene: CH2=CH2 + 2 HCl + ½ O2 → ClCH2CH2Cl + H2OOxychlorination is of special importance in the making of 1,2-dichloroethane, which is then converted into vinyl
