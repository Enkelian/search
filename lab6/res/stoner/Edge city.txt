Edge city
Edge city is a term that originated in the United States for a concentration of business, shopping, and entertainment outside a traditional downtown or central business district, in what had previously been a suburban residential or rural area. The term was popularized by the 1991 book Edge City: Life on the New Frontier by Joel Garreau, who established its current meaning while working as a reporter for The Washington Post. Garreau argues that the edge city has become the standard form of urban growth worldwide, representing a 20th-century urban form unlike that of the 19th-century central downtown. Other terms for these areas include suburban activity centers, megacenters, and suburban business districts. These districts have now developed in many countries. Definitions In 1991, Garreau established five rules for a place to be considered an edge city: Has five million or more square feet (465,000 m²) of leasable office space Has 600,000 square feet (56,000 m²) or more of leasable retail space Has more jobs than bedrooms Is perceived by the population as one place Was nothing like a "city" as recently as 30 years ago. Then it was just bedrooms, if not cow pastures."Most edge cities develop at or near existing
