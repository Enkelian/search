Shot in the Dark (song)
"Shot in the Dark" is a song most famously performed by heavy metal solo artist Ozzy Osbourne. It is the ninth and final track on his 1986 album The Ultimate Sin. A top-ten hit on Mainstream rock radio, the song also became his most successful single on the Billboard Hot 100 at the time, peaking at number 68. The official music video for the song was directed by Andy Morahan.Whilst the song is most commonly attributed to Ozzy Osbourne, the writing of the song originated with bassist Phil Soussan, who was part of the band Wildlife in the early 1980s and composed the tune's melody. Subsequently, fellow Wildlife bandmates Steve Overland and Chris Overland wrote the original lyrics and arrangement and demoed a derivative version of the song. Meanwhile, when Soussan joined Ozzy's band several years later, his original version of the song was re-worked with Ozzy. However, people have not only disputed whether the Overland brothers deserve writing credit for Osbourne's version, but also questioned Osbourne's role in the writing of this version. This authorship issue has become a source of contention over the years, and in spite of its success, the song has rarely appeared on Ozzy Osbourne
