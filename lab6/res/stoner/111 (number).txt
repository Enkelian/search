111 (number)
111 (One hundred [and] eleven) is the natural number following 110 and preceding 112. In mathematics 111 is a perfect totient number.111 is R3 or the second repunit, a number like 11, 111, or 1111 that consists of repeated units, or 1's. It equals 3 × 37, therefore all triplets (numbers like 222 or 777) in base ten are of the form 3n × 37. As a repunit, it also follows that 111 is a palindromic number. All triplets in all bases are multiples of 111 in that base, therefore the number represented by 111 in a particular base is the only triplet that can ever be prime. 111 is not prime in base ten, but is prime in base two, where 1112 = 710. It is also prime in these other bases up to 128: 3, 5, 6, 8, 12, 14, 15, 17, 20, 21, 24, 27, 33, 38, 41, 50, 54, 57, 59, 62, 66, 69, 71, 75, 77, 78, 80, 89, 90, 99, 101, 105, 110, 111, 117, 119 (sequence A002384 in the OEIS) In base 18, the number 111 is 73 (= 34310) which is the only base where 111 is a perfect power.
