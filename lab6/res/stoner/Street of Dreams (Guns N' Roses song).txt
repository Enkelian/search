Street of Dreams (Guns N' Roses song)
"Street of Dreams" is a song by the American rock band Guns N' Roses, featured on their 2008 album Chinese Democracy. The song is the third promotional song sent to radio stations, but was not released as a commercial single eligible for international Singles charts. From 2001 to 2008, the song was called "The Blues", but was changed to "Street of Dreams" for the album's release. The song was originally written by the band's leader and lead vocalist Axl Rose, but bassist Tommy Stinson and keyboardist Dizzy Reed contributed some of the guitar, bass and piano melodies. "Street of Dreams" has been a staple at Guns N' Roses concerts since 2001, being played at almost every show on the various Chinese Democracy Tours. However, the song left the set list entirely during the Not In This Lifetime... Tour. Personnel Credits are adapted from the album's liner notes.
