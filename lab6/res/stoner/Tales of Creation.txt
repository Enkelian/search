Tales of Creation
Tales of Creation is the fourth album by Swedish doom metal band Candlemass released in 1989 and reissued in 2001 with a bonus CD. Some of the material from this album ("Dark Reflections", "Under the Oak", "Into the Unfathomed Tower", "Somewhere in Nowhere" and "A Tale of Creation") were originally recorded in 1985 by one of the earliest incarnations of Candlemass. "Under the Oak" is actually a remake of a song from their 1986 debut Epicus Doomicus Metallicus. The cover art is a modified Gustave Doré's work "The Creation of Light". Tales of Creation was also the last to feature vocalist Messiah Marcolin for 15 years until he (temporarily) came back. Track listing All tracks are written by Leif Edling.
