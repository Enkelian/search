Wide-body aircraft
A wide-body aircraft, also known as a twin-aisle aircraft, is a jet airliner with a fuselage wide enough to accommodate two passenger aisles with seven or more seats abreast.

The largest wide-body aircraft are over 6 m (20 ft) wide, and can accommodate up to eleven passengers abreast in high-density configurations. By comparison, a typical narrow-body airliner has a diameter of 3 to 4 m (10 to 13 ft), with a single aisle, and seats between two and six people abreast.Wide-body aircraft were originally designed for a combination of efficiency and passenger comfort and to increase the amount of cargo space.

The biggest wide-body aircraft are known as jumbo jets due to their very large size; examples include the Boeing 747 (the first wide-body and
