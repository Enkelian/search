Sky News Weather Channel
Sky News Weather Channel is an Australian satellite television channel owned by Australian News Channel, a subsidiary of News Corp Australia. Launched on January 1, 1999, the channel broadcasts weather forecasts and weather-related news and analysis 24 hours a day. SNWC runs on a 15-minute menu of local, national, regional, dam level and rainfall forecasts, as well as continuous coverage of extreme weather if required. Sky News Weather Channel also simulcasts live the Sky News on WIN-produced breakfast program Headline News along with that channel on weekdays from 6am to 8:30am. History Sky News Weather Channel started broadcasting on 1 January 1999 under the name "Weather 21": channel 21 on the Austar channel line-up. Weather 21 was set up by Cox Inall Communications and the meteorological firm The Weather Company and was owned by Austar. The programming was pitched to Austar's largely rural and regional audience. Initial presenters on the channel were Allan Humphries, Lyndal Davies, and meteorologist Mark Hardy, broadcasting live from 6am to 10pm daily, with the overnight programming consisting of an automated loop of forecasts, satellite, and radar, accompanied by music. In early 2000, no longer located at 21, the name was changed to "The Weather Channel".
