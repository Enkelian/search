Strife (band)
Strife, is an American hardcore punk band from Thousand Oaks, California. They formed in 1991. Biography Their first LP, One Truth, was released in 1994 by Victory Records. Strife was considered one of the three "big" bands on the then-new Victory Records label, which also included Earth Crisis and Snapcase. Strife released their second album, In This Defiance in 1997. This album was also well regarded by the straight edge/hardcore community. It was also notable for the guest appearances, with Chino Moreno of Deftones, Dino Cazares of Fear Factory and Igor Cavalera of Sepultura all taking turns on the album. Two years later, Strife broke up, citing creative differences and exhaustion. Victory Records released Truth Through Defiance, a compilation of live tracks and previously unreleased material. In 2000, Strife reunited to play several benefit concerts, and by the following year had officially reformed and released Angermeans.
