The Thing Which Solomon Overlooked
The Thing Which Solomon Overlooked is the seventh album by Japanese experimental band, Boris. This album, unlike most of the previous albums over of the past few years, is more oriented towards drone and ambient genres. It's also one of the first Boris releases completely devoid of any vocals, and the first one that doesn't feature any kind of drumming. The album was released in a one-time pressing of 550 copies on vinyl by the Finnish label Kult of Nihilow.In 2006, the band released The Thing Which Solomon Overlooked 2, the second part of what is now a series of albums under the umbrella title of "The Thing Which Solomon Overlooked". The band proceeded to release the third part of the series soon after and in 2013, the album was remastered and included on the boxset The Thing Which Solomon Overlooked - Chronicle. The song "A Bao A Qu" featured in this album shares the same title as the one featured on the album Soundtrack from Film "Mabuta no Ura" but this version is a completely different song.
