Agios Vasileios, Corinthia
Agios Vasileios (Greek: Άγιος Βασίλειος meaning Saint Basil) is a village in the municipal unit of Tenea in Corinthia, Greece. It is located about 25 km to the south of the city of Corinth, approximately halfway along the old national road to Argos (GR-7). It lies at the foot of the Dafnias mountains and the Chouni Pass. Historical population Historical overview Prehistory Archaeological excavations prove that the area around Ayios Vasilios has been settled since pre-historical times. Zygouries, west of Ayios Vasilios, was excavated by the American archaeologist Carl William Blegen in the 1920s. He found a Bronze Age settlement dating from approximately 1300 BC to 1320 BC. Sadly, agricultural work and forestry on Zygouries hill has destroyed one of the most important pre-historical settlements of the Balkans. Obsidian, sherds of which can be found over the whole area (particularly south of Ayios Sostis (the cave of Antonis in the area of Boubakia), in the Chouni Pass southwest of the village, or near the caves on Dafnias mountain) are further proof of prehistoric settlement. Roman period Roman emperor Hadrian’s aqueduct from Lake Stymfalia passed through the village of Ayios Vasilios. Traces of it are still visible west of the village
