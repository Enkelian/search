KHRR
KHRR, virtual channel 40 (UHF digital channel 16), is a Telemundo owned-and-operated television station licensed to Tucson, Arizona, United States. The station is owned by the Telemundo Station Group subsidiary of NBCUniversal (itself a subsidiary of Comcast). KHRR's studios are located on North Stone Avenue in downtown Tucson, and its transmitter is located atop the Tucson Mountains. Although identifying as a separate station in its own right, KHRR is considered a semi-satellite of KTAZ (channel 39) in Phoenix. As such, it simulcasts all Telemundo programming as provided through its parent, but airs separate commercial inserts and legal identifications, and has its own website. Local newscasts, produced by KTAZ and branded as Noticiero Telemundo Arizona, are simulcast on both stations.
