Indium(I) chloride
There are three sets of Indium halides, the trihalides, the monohalides, and several intermediate halides. In the monohalides the oxidation state of indium is +1 and their proper names are indium(I) fluoride, indium(I) chloride, indium(I) bromide and indium(I) iodide. The intermediate halides contain indium with oxidation states, +1, +2 and +3. Indium trihalides In all of the trihalides the oxidation state of indium is +3, and their proper names are indium(III) fluoride, indium(III) chloride, indium(III) bromide, and indium(III) iodide. The trihalides are Lewis acidic. Indium trichloride is a starting point in the production of trimethylindium which is used in the semiconductor industry. Indium(III) fluoride InF3 is a white crystalline solid with mp 1170 °C. Its structure contains 6 coordinate indium. Indium(III) chloride InCl3 is a white crystalline solid mp 586 °C. It has the same structure as AlCl3. Indium(III) bromide InBr3 is a pale yellow crystalline solid, m.p. 435 °C. It has the same structure as AlCl3. InBr3 is finding some use in organic synthesis as a water tolerant Lewis acid. Indium(III) iodide InI3 is a coloured crystalline solid, usually described as orange. Distinct yellow and a red forms are known. The red form undergoes a transition to the yellow
