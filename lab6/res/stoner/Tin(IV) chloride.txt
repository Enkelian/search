Tin(IV) chloride
Tin(IV) chloride, also known as tin tetrachloride or stannic chloride, is an inorganic compound with the formula SnCl4. It is a colorless hygroscopic liquid, which fumes on contact with air. It is used as a precursor to other tin compounds. It was first discovered by Andreas Libavius (1550–1616) and was known as spiritus fumans libavii. Preparation It is prepared from reaction of chlorine gas with tin at 115 °C (239 °F). Sn + 2 Cl2 → SnCl4 Structure Anhydrous tin(IV) chloride solidifies at −33 °C to give monoclinic crystals with the P21/c space group. It is isostructural with SnBr4. The molecules adopt near-perfect tetrahedral symmetry with average Sn–Cl distances of 227.9(3) pm. Hydrates Several hydrates of tin tetrachloride are known. The pentahydrate, SnCl4·5H2O was formerly known as butter of tin. They all consist of [SnCl4(H2O)2] molecules together with varying amounts of water of crystallization. The additional water molecules link together the molecules of [SnCl4(H2O)2] through hydrogen bonds. Although the pentahydrate is the most common hydrate, lower hydrates have also been characterised. Reactions Aside from water, other Lewis bases form adducts. These include ammonia and organophosphines. With hydrochloric acid the complex [SnCl6]2− is formed making the so-called hexachlorostannic acid. Precursor to
