Trensmat Records
Trensmat Records was an independent record label based in Ireland. It specialised in drone, noise music, krautrock and grooves. All releases were on vinyl in limited editions. TR020 marked the end of the first phase of the label in which it had grown to be internationally distributed - a move away from its traditional method of small-run handmade editions sold directly to its mailing list and handful of shops. This phase nearly finished the label and it took 18 months out to rebuild and re-launched in 2011. That year saw it return to its original concept to great success with three sets of very well received 7"s. Artists associated with the label include The Telescopes, Mugstar, AreaC, Magnetize, Heavy Winged, Circle, Astral Social Club, The Shining Path, Cave, Cheval Sombre, Mudhoney, Acid Mothers Temple, White Hills, Kinski, Bardo Pond, GNOD, Astral Social Club Discography The Telescopes - Night Terrors 7" (TR001) August 2006 Mugstar - Bethany Heart Star 7" (TR002) February 2007 The Telescopes - Psychic Viewfinder 7" (TR004) May 2007 Area C - Trick with a Knife 7" (TR003) June 2007 Magnetize - Noise to Signal 7" (TR005) July 2007 Heavy Winged - On the Marble Cliffs 7" (TR006)
