Interblock Ljubljana
Nogometni klub Interblock (English: Interblock Football Club), commonly referred to as NK Interblock or simply Interblock, is a Slovenian football club which plays in the city of Ljubljana. The club used the name NK IB Ljubljana in UEFA club competitions as UEFA doesn't allow sponsorship naming of clubs in their competitions. They won the Slovenian Cup twice and the Slovenian Supercup once. History The club was founded in 1975 as NK Ježica. In the next two decades they competed mostly in Ljubljana League, which was the fifth or sixth level of Yugoslav football. After the independence of Slovenia the league was transformed into intercommunal MNZ League and the club was renamed to NK Factor Ježica. They merged with nearby Črnuče in 1997 and therefore played in Slovenian Second League until 1999. Factor was then relegated to third level, where they stayed until 2004, when they won the centre zone and defeated Korte in promotion play-off. After returning to the second division, the club had to move their home matches to ŽŠD Ljubljana Stadium due to insufficient criteria of their home field. Factor earned promotion to the Slovenian PrvaLiga in 2006, finishing first in the Slovenian Second League in the 2005–06
