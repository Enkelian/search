Rhodes Scholarship
The Rhodes Scholarship is an international postgraduate award for students to study at the University of Oxford. It was established in 1902, making it the first large-scale programme of international scholarship. The Rhodes Scholarship was founded by English businessman and politician Cecil John Rhodes, to promote unity between English-speaking nations and instill a sense of civic-minded leadership and moral fortitude in future leaders irrespective of their chosen career paths. Although initially restricted to male applicants from countries that are today within the British Commonwealth, as well as Germany and the United States, today the scholarship is open to applicants from all backgrounds and from across the globe. Since its creation, controversy has surrounded its former exclusion of women (thus leading to the establishment of the co-educational Marshall Scholarship). Prominent recipients of the Rhodes Scholarship include politicians, academics, scientists, authors, and entrepreneurs. Notable American political recipients include former President of the United States Bill Clinton, former United States National Security Advisor and United States Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice, former Governor of Louisiana Piyush "Bobby" Jindal, former United States Secretary of the Air Force and former Congresswoman Heather Wilson, and former United States Secretary of Health and Human Services
