A slightly-modified version of the traditional script, called Tifinagh IRCAM, is used in a number of Moroccan elementary schools in teaching the Berber language to children as well as a number of publications. Origins Tifinagh or Libyc was widely used in antiquity by speakers of Libyc languages throughout North Africa and on the Canary Islands. Some authors believe it to be attested from as far back as the 2nd millennium BC, to the present time. The script's origin is considered by most scholars as being of local origin, although a relationship between the Punic alphabet or the Phoenician alphabet has also been suggested. An alternative suggestion, by Helmut Satzinger, is that its origin is to be seen in the Ancient South Arabian script. There are four known variants: Eastern Libyc, Western Libyc, Bu Njem Libyc and Saharan Libyc.
