Meadowlands Arena
Meadowlands Arena (formerly Brendan Byrne Arena, Continental Airlines Arena and IZOD Center) is an indoor venue located in the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey, United States. The arena is located on New Jersey Route 120 and is across the highway from MetLife Stadium and the Meadowlands Racetrack and located next to the American Dream shopping and entertainment complex. The arena was originally built to accommodate a move of the New York Nets basketball team to New Jersey and opened in 1981. In 1982, the Colorado Rockies hockey team joined the Nets in the new building and became known as the New Jersey Devils. The Nets and Devils were joined by the Seton Hall Pirates men's collegiate basketball program in 1985. In 2007, the Prudential Center opened in nearby Newark and the New Jersey Devils moved out. Seton Hall, whose campus in South Orange is closer to Newark than East Rutherford, followed and moved their basketball games there. The Nets remained for three more seasons before moving to Newark, where they played two seasons before departing New Jersey for Barclays Center in Brooklyn. The men's basketball team from Fordham University played four home games during the 2010â€“11 season
