École nationale d'administration publique
The École nationale d'administration publique (ENAP meaning National School of Public Administration) is a graduate school in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. It was established in 1969 by the Quebec provincial government as a means of encouraging people to study professional public administration during a period when a number of social and structural changes were taking place within the province. The enabling legislation is An Act respecting educational institutions at the university level.The school is unique in that it is partly a pragmatic learning environment geared to educating Quebecers for positions within the public administration and partly a traditional university.
