It is 290 kilometres (180 mi) long and 225 kilometres (140 mi) wide, with an area of 103,600 square kilometres (40,000 sq mi).The Nafud is an erg, a desert region located in the north-central Saudi Arabia.

The Nefud is connected to the Rub' al Khali by the Dahna, a corridor of gravel plains and sand dunes, 800 mi (1,287 km) long and 15 to 50 miles (24.1 to 80.5 km) wide.
