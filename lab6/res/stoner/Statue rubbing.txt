Statue rubbing
Statue rubbing is the act of touching a part of a public statue. Popular among tourists, it is a form of superstition that is believed to bring good luck, ensure a return to the city, improve love life or make a wish come true. The parts that are supposed to be rubbed are usually the most protruding or characteristic ones, for example noses or feet. Some of those superstitions also involve touching breasts or genitalia of the person depicted on the statue â€“ this is usually supposed to bring luck in love or improve fertility. Rubbing statues can have negative effects on them as it causes erosion. Because of that some places discourage or ban tourists from doing it. It is also possible to acquire a bacterial infection from touching statues.
