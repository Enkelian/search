2007 Norwegian Football Cup
The 2007 Norwegian Football Cup was the 102nd season of Norwegian annual knockout football tournament. The competition started on 19 May 2007 with the first-round games and ended on 11 November 2007 with the final. The defending champions were Fredrikstad. The format of the Cup has not changed for this season what means that, unlike other European cup competitions, all teams (including Tippeligaen ones) entered the Cup in the First Round. In the First and Second Round amateur teams (or at least lower-placed at the time of the draw) were seeded and played the matches at home ground. From the Third Round until the end the draw was random. The winners, Lillestrøm, qualified for the second qualifying round of the 2008–09 UEFA Cup.
