North Berkeley station
North Berkeley is an underground Bay Area Rapid Transit station located on Sacramento Street in the North Berkeley region of Berkeley, California. The station is bounded by Virginia, Sacramento, Delaware, and Acton streets in a residential area north of University Avenue. The main station entrance sits within a circular building at the center of a parking lot, while an elevator between the surface and the platform is located at the parking lot's Sacramento Street edge. History The site was originally an open area across which the Key System constructed its Westbrae streetcar line, subsequently given the letter designation "G". The tracks ran diagonally across the property in virtually the same alignment as today's underground BART tracks. Homes began to be constructed along the periphery of the site, and after the G-Westbrae line was closed in 1941, filled in most of the rest of it. All of these were demolished in the 1960s to make way for construction of the North Berkeley station. Service at the station began on January 29, 1973.Pursuant to a law passed by the state of California in 2018, the City of Berkeley and BART are beginning to plan the development of transit-oriented housing on the station
