Dark Territory (album)
Dark Territory is a studio album by trumpeter Dave Douglas which was released in June 2016 on Douglas' Greenleaf Music label. The album is named after Fred Kaplan's book Dark Territory: The Secret History of Cyber War released in 2016. Reception The Allmusic review awarded the album 4 stars out of 5, stating "As with 2014's High Risk, Dark Territory features live, in-studio performances Douglas has dubbed "electro-acoustic" jams. These primarily consist of computer- and synth-based soundscapes created by Shigeto that Douglas and his ensemble play along to. Shigeto then manipulates and interacts with the band and his soundscapes in real time, sculpting the proceedings. The result is a sound that falls somewhere in between experimental electronica and avant-garde jazz improvisation ... Ultimately, it's that visual and physical tangibility of Douglas and Shigeto's collaborations that makes Dark Territory such a heightened listening experience". They also selected it as one of their Favorite Jazz Albums of 2016.DownBeat said "Douglas and his group High Risk have created something original here. Dark Territory is addictive, and while it wears its influences—Miles Davis, Ministry, Nine Inch Nails, David Bowie, hip-hop—on its daring, highly stylized sleeve, it’s also unique."
