Hafnium tetrachloride
Hafnium(IV) chloride is the inorganic compound with the formula HfCl4. This colourless solid is the precursor to most hafnium organometallic compounds. It has a variety of highly specialized applications, mainly in materials science and as a catalyst. Preparation HfCl4 can be produced by several related procedures: The reaction of carbon tetrachloride and hafnium oxide at above 450 °C;HfO2 + 2 CCl4 → HfCl4 + 2 COCl2Chlorination of a mixture of HfO2 and carbon above 600 °C using chlorine gas or sulfur monochloride:HfO2 + 2 Cl2 + C → HfCl4 + CO2Chlorination of hafnium carbide above 250 °C. Separation of Zr and Hf Hafnium and zirconium occur together in minerals such as zircon, cyrtolite and baddeleyite. Zircon contains 0.05% to 2.0% hafnium dioxide HfO2, cyrtolite with 5.5% to 17% HfO2 and baddeleyite contains 1.0 to 1.8 percent HfO2. Hafnium and zirconium compounds are extracted from ores together and converted to a mixture of the tetrachlorides. The separation of HfCl4 and ZrCl4 is difficult because the compounds of Hf and Zr have very similar chemical and physical properties. Their atomic radii are similar: the atomic radius is 156.4 pm for hafnium, whereas that of Zr is 160 pm. These two metals undergo
