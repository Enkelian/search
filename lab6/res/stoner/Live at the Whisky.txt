Live at the Whisky
Live at the Whisky is the second live recording by American rock band Kansas, released in 1992. The U.S. version includes a bonus track "Lonely Street" from 1975. A German version of the release contains an alternative bonus track, "Journey from Mariabronn" which actually includes both "Belexes" and "Journey from Mariabronn" together from that same show. The German bonus track is also available on iTunes, Napster, and other streaming services. The album notes state that it was recorded in "one take", and has been criticized by some because of the harsh vocals of singer Steve Walsh, whose voice was failing at that time as a result of a variety of issues, including fatigue and substance abuse. It was the first official Kansas release (other than compilations) not to reach the album charts, and also the first not released on a major record label. Walsh has stated in interviews that the recording of this CD and video was doomed from the beginning and he's embarrassed of anything that has to do with it. Since the band was funding this CD and video themselves, to save money, the band used videotape instead of film, which caused problems during the filming. Excessive lighting
