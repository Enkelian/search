Spar Nord
Spar Nord Bank A/S (Nasdaq Copenhagen: SPNO) is a bank based in North Jutland, Denmark. The history of the bank can be traced back to May 12, 1824, where "Bye og Omegns Sparekasse" (The Savings Bank for Town and County) was established in Aalborg. After a number of merges through the 20th century, the name was changed from "Sparekassen Nordjylland" (The Savings Bank of Northern Jutland) to its current short form. In the last decade Spar Nord has opened several offices in larger towns outside Northern Jutland in Denmark. As of 2019, it is Denmarkâ€™s sixth biggest bank.
