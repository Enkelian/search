Potassium permanganate
Potassium permanganate is a chemical compound with chemical formula KMnO4; specifically, a salt consisting of K+ and MnOâˆ’4 ions (with manganese is in the +7 oxidation state). It is a purplish-black crystalline solid, that dissolves in water to give intensely pink or purple solutions.Potassium permanganate is widely used in chemical industry and laboratories as a strong oxidizing agent, and also as a medication for dermatitis, for cleaning wounds, and general disinfection. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. In 2000, worldwide production was estimated at 30,000 tonnes. Uses Almost all applications of potassium permanganate exploit its oxidizing properties. As a strong oxidant that does not generate toxic byproducts, KMnO4 has many niche uses. Medical uses Potassium permanganate is used for a number of skin conditions. This includes fungal infections of the foot, impetigo, pemphigus, superficial wounds, dermatitis, and tropical ulcers. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. Water treatment Potassium permanganate is used extensively in the water treatment industry. It is used as a regeneration chemical to remove iron and
