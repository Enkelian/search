The Greatest Hits (Cheap Trick album)
The Greatest Hits is the first compilation album by Cheap Trick. It contains many of Cheap Trick's popular songs, as well as a previously unreleased cover version of The Beatles' "Magical Mystery Tour", which according to the liner notes, was an outtake from the Lap of Luxury album. Though it peaked at only #174 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, it remained a steady seller, and was certified platinum for one million U.S. shipments seven years after its release.Rendered obsolete by succeeding compilations that contain almost all of the songs in this album, it was nonetheless re-released in 2003, in a re-mastered edition with the addition of "Clock Strikes Ten".
