Bass trombone
There are many different types of trombone. The most frequently encountered trombones today are the tenor and bass, though as with other Renaissance instruments such as the recorder, the trombone has been built in every size from piccolo to contrabass (see pitch of brass instruments). In order of pitch Cimbasso The cimbasso is a brass instrument in the trombone family, with a sound ranging from warm and mellow to bright and menacing. It has three to six piston or rotary valves, a predominantly cylindrical bore, and in its modern incarnation is most often pitched in F, though models are available in E♭, C, and occasionally B♭. It is in the same range as a tuba or a contrabass trombone. Technique on the cimbasso can be much quicker than the contrabass trombone due to its use of valves. The modern cimbasso is most commonly used in opera scores by Giuseppe Verdi from Oberto to Aida, and by Giacomo Puccini, though only in Le Villi, though the word also appears in the score of Vincenzo Bellini's Norma, which premiered in 1831. Outside of the operatic context, the Italian composer Ottorino Respighi included the instrument in his scoring of the symphonic poem Pines
