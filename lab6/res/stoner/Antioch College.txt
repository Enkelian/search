Founded in 1850 by the Christian Connection, the college began operating in 1852 as a non-sectarian institution; politician and education reformer Horace Mann became its first president. It was the founding, constituent college of Antioch University System, which Antioch College remained a part of from 1978 until 2008 when it closed. Thereafter, a group of alumni formed a new Ohio corporation, Antioch College Continuation Corporation, and bought from the University both the physical campus and a license to use the name "Antioch College".

Students receive narrative evaluations and academic letter grades. Antioch College is a member of the Great Lakes Colleges Association, the Global Liberal Arts Alliance, and the Southwestern Ohio Council for
