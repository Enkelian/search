Grim Reaper (band)
Grim Reaper are a British heavy metal band from the new wave of British heavy metal era. The band was formed in 1979 in Droitwich, England, by guitarist Nick Bowcott. History Early years (1979â€“1984) The band formed in Worcestershire and initially featured Paul de Mercado on vocals. Their first album demo tape was called Bleed 'Em Dry and had an album's worth of material. After developing a following in the north west and Yorkshire they caught the attention of Heavy Metal records, who added a re-recorded version of The Reaper from the demo. A positive write up in the Kerrang! 'Armed and Dangerous' section preceded a breakup of the initial lineup, with only Nick Bowcott remaining. He recruited Dave Wanklin on bass, Lee Harris on Drums and most importantly, Steve Grimmett on vocals. This lineup won a 1982 Battle of the Bands competition featuring over 100 bands, winning studio time to demo new material. Grimmett was then the unofficial vocalist for Cheltenham's Chateaux, who were signed to Darryl Johnston's Ebony Records label, so he handed them the Grim Reaper demo tape and the band was signed. Their debut album was See You in Hell. The album was released in 1984
