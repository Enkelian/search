Drum's Not Dead
Drum's Not Dead is the third album by experimental rock band Liars, released on February 20, 2006 through Mute Records. It was recorded at the Planet Roc recording studio in Berlin and produced by Angus Andrew. The album's sound is characterized by pounding drums, highly distorted guitar drones, and falsetto vocals. Upon initial release, the album featured a DVD with three different music videos for each song. The album's title and several track names refer to two fictional characters—Drum and Mount Heart Attack—who, according to the band, each represent a state of being, à la yin and yang. Drum is assertive and productive, the spirit of creative confidence. With two drum kits integral to many of these percussive, propulsive, highly rhythmic convulsions, Drum came to be acknowledged as a fourth member of the band. Conversely, Mount Heart Attack is the reaction to Drum's action, the embodiment of stress and self-doubt. Both became key elements in the creative process.Pitchfork ranked the album number 6 on their list of the Top 50 albums of 2006. Track listing "Be Quiet Mt. Heart Attack!" – 3:28 "Let's Not Wrestle Mt. Heart Attack" – 4:31 "A Visit from Drum" – 4:19 "Drum Gets a Glimpse"
