Austin Outlaws
The Austin Outlaws are a women's football team in the Women's Football Alliance. They are based in Austin, Texas. Home games are played at Chaparral Stadium on the campus of Westlake High School. Founded in 2001 as a charter member of the Independent Women's Football League, the Outlaws finished 5-1, good enough for the first IWFL championship (playoffs were not held that year). The following year of 2002, the Outlaws finished 7-2 and made the IWFL playoffs. After defeating the Corvallis Pride in the qualifier, the Outlaws fell 24-4 to the New York Sharks in the championship game. In 2003 the Outlaws moved to the National Women's Football Association, where they would spend their next six seasons. That inaugural season was only as an exhibition team, and the Outlaws finished with a 1-1 record. For 2004, the Outlaws became a full-time member of the NWFA. Despite finishing with a 5-3 record (second place in the Southwest Division), the Outlaws missed the playoffs. In 2005, the Outlaws again missed the playoffs, finishing at 4-4 and ninth place in the Southern Division. 2006 was the year the Outlaws returned to the postseason, finishing at 6-2 and second place in the South West
