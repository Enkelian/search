Ministry of Sound
Ministry of Sound Group is a multimedia entertainment business based in London with a nightclub, shared workspace and private members club, worldwide events operation, music publishing business and fitness studio. James Palumbo is the co-founder and former Chairman and CEO of the Group. He handed over the day-to-day running of the business to Lohan Presencer in 2008. In 2018, Presencer became chairman. Nightclub Ministry of Sound began as the idea of Justin Berkmann. Inspired by New York’s Paradise Garage - which he described as "an amazing club. It had lights, darkness, music, quiet – everything you wanted" - Berkmann set out to create London's first club devoted to the American house music scenes of 1980s New York City, Newark (which centred around Club Zanzibar), Chicago and Detroit. As opposed to striking a balance between the typical hallmarks of a live music venue, Ministry of Sound was conceived as an arena purely dedicated to sound. Berkmann stated: "My concept for Ministry was purely this: 100% sound system first, lights second, design third (in that order); the reverse of everyone else’s idea." According to him, they spent £500,000 on the club's sound system, and the same amount again on soundproofing the club
