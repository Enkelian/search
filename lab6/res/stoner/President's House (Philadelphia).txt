President's House (Philadelphia)
The President's House, at 524â€“30 Market Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was the third Presidential Mansion. It housed George Washington from November 27, 1790 to March 10, 1797 and John Adams from March 21, 1797 to May 30, 1800. History The three-and-a-half-story brick mansion on the south side of Market Street was built in 1767 by widow Mary Lawrence Masters. In 1772, she gave it as a wedding gift to her elder daughter, who married Richard Penn, a grandson of William Penn and the lieutenant-governor of the Colony. The Penns and the Masterses moved to England during the early days of the American Revolutionary War. During the British occupation of Philadelphia, September 1777 to June 1778, the house was headquarters for General Sir William Howe. Following the British evacuation, it housed the American military governor, Benedict Arnold, and it was here that he began his treason. After Arnold left Philadelphia, the next resident was John Holker. Holker was a purchasing agent for the French, who were American allies at the time. During his residency the house suffered a fire, and was sold to a man whom Holker knew well, financier Robert Morris. In 1781, Morris purchased, refurbished, and expanded the house;
