Fluf
Fluf (stylized as fluf) is a punk rock band formed in San Diego in 1992. History O (Otis Barthoulameu - vocals, guitar) and Jonny Donhowe (bass guitar) formed the band after their previous band, Olivelawn, split up, recruiting drummer Miles Gillett. After several seven-inch singles (including a cover version of PJ Harvey's "Sheela Na Gig"), the band's debut album was released in 1993. Generally known as Mangravy, each physical format had a different title. A second album followed in 1994 (Home Improvements, also released on vinyl as Whitey on the Moon and on cassette as Stocking the Lake With Brown Trout), and in 1996 Donhowe left, to be replaced by Josh Higgins. This line-up recorded their major label (MCA) debut Waikiki (1997) and Road Rage (1998), with a final album-length EP, I Know I'm Nobody released in 2000.
