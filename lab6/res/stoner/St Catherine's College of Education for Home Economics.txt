The Dominican Order also established The Froebel College of Education for primary school teachers at Sion Hill. From the 1974 the college offered a three-year Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.) in Home Economics which was validated by Trinity College Dublin, this was recognised by the Teaching Council of Ireland for secondary school teaching of Home Economics, since students would also have studied Irish or Religion they would also be qualified to teach those subjects.In 2004 it was announced that the college was to close, and it was closed in September 2007 with much of the Home Economics tuition going to St. Angela's College, Sligo.
