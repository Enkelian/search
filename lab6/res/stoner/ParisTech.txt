ParisTech
ParisTech (former Institut des sciences et technologies de Paris (Paris Institute of Technology)) is a foundation that brings together 10 renowned engineering schools located in Paris, France, that specialise in science and business. History In 1991, a number of engineering Grandes Écoles set up a coordinating voluntary association, called "Grandes écoles d'ingénieurs de Paris", to foster closer collaboration in areas of common interest and thereby acquire international recognition as an entity of sufficient size and importance. In 1999 its name was changed to "ParisTech".In 2007, ParisTech's status changed to a public establishment for scientific cooperation (établissement public de coopération scientifique). It is headed by a President, assisted by an executive bureau and a secretary general and administrated by a board of directors, supported by a strategic orientation council and a scientific council. The board of directors includes one representative of each college or institute as well as researchers, faculty members, and one representative of the students. Colleges and institutes The member institutes of ParisTech are long-established publicly owned educational and research institutions, many of which were founded in the 18th century. Some deliver a high-level, broad education in science such as Arts et Métiers ParisTech, MINES ParisTech, École des Ponts
