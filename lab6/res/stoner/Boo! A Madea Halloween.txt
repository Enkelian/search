Boo! A Madea Halloween
Boo! A Madea Halloween is a 2016 American comedy horror film directed, written, starring and co-produced by Tyler Perry. The idea for the film originated from a fictitious Madea Halloween movie that was mentioned in Chris Rock's 2014 film Top Five. It is the eighth film in the Madea series and the second to not be adapted from a stage play (the first being Madea's Witness Protection). The film was released on October 21, 2016 by Lionsgate and, despite receiving generally negative reviews, grossed $74.8 million against a $20 million budget, making it the third-highest-grossing Madea film. A sequel, Boo 2! A Madea Halloween, was released on October 20, 2017. Plot Jonathan (Yousef Erakat) and his fraternity brothers invite Tiffany Simmons (Diamond White) and her friends Rain Mathison (Bella Thorne), Leah Devereaux (Lexy Panterra), and a reluctant Aday Walker (Liza Koshy) to a Halloween party. Tiffany's father Brian (Perry) forbids her to attend and is later aghast at her smutty video chat with Jonathan. That night, Madea (Perry) and Aunt Bam (Cassi Davis) distribute candy to trick-or-treaters, though Bam steals candy back from them. Joe (Perry) dresses as a clown to frighten the women, with their friend Hattie Mae Love
