2007–08 Serbian Cup
The 2007–08 Serbian Cup season is the second season of Serbia's football knockout competition. Red Star, the holders of the Lav Kup Srbije, began the tournament as favorites to lift the cup again. It seemed as though Red Star where on their way to winning the cup again having passed all stages with class. Then came the semifinal clash with arch-rival Partizan in what many considered the game of the tournament. The match came with a lot of controversy due to a goal Red Star scored late that was flagged for offside. The replays clearly showed that Red Star's midfielder Nenad Milijaš was on, but what made matters worse was the fact that the referee apologized to him and admitted that he had made a mistake. Several days after the incident the side judge retired from refereeing and openly apologized to Red Star and the supporters of the team. In the final Partizan went on to face heavy underdog FK Zemun, who had a miracle run in the cup which included three wins from penalty shootouts on their road to the final. Zemun's luck ran out however, as Partizan cruised to a 3–0 victory to claim their tenth domestic cup.
