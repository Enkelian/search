History The station first signed on the air on October 29, 1987, originally broadcasting on UHF channel 57 as an affiliate of Channel America. Shortly afterward, the station was acquired by ZGS Communications, which converted the station into the Tampa Bay market's new Telemundo affiliate. WRMD originally broadcast on UHF channel 57 until the early 2000s, when the station relocated to UHF channel 49, to make room for WTTA (channel 38)'s new digital signal on channel 57. In 2004, the station began to be carried on Bright House Networks' cable systems in portions of the Tampa Bay market outside of Tampa proper.
