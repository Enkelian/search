Tab (album)
Tab (a.k.a. Tab 25 or 25 Tab) is the title of Monster Magnet's second EP, released in Europe in 1991 and in the United States two years later. Originally released on Glitterhouse Records, it was recorded before the band's 1991 debut album Spine of God but issued afterwards to capitalize on its success. Though long enough to qualify as a full-length album, it is referred to as an EP. It is generally viewed by critics as the band's most psychedelic release, with the first two tracks alone totaling 45 minutes. The cover bears the text "MONSTERMAGNET 25............TAB"; however, the band's website refers to it as "TAB". Track listing "Tab..."
