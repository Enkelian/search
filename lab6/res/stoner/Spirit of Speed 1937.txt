Spirit of Speed 1937
Spirit of Speed 1937 is a racing video game developed by Broadsword Interactive. The game was originally released in 1999 exclusively in Europe by Hasbro Interactive, who released the game under the MicroProse brand name. In 2000 the game was ported to the Dreamcast, and was published by Acclaim Entertainment under the LJN banner, five years after LJN was shut down by Acclaim. This version saw a North American release, and was released there on June 29, 2000. Spirit of Speed 1937 takes gamers back to the 1930s when motorsports were in their infancy and drivers raced for the thrill of speed, the danger, and the glamor that came with it. A port for the Game Boy Advance was in the works but was scrapped. Gameplay Spirit of Speed 1937 features 15 classic vehicles, including the first twin-supercharged single-seat racer, the Alfa Romeo P3. Also featured are the twin V8 Alfa Romeo Bimotore designed by none other than Scuderia Ferrari, the Alfa Romeo 12C, the Auto Union Type C that was designed by the legendary Ferdinand Porsche, and the Auto Union Type D, a model that conformed to the Formula 1 standard of 3.0 liter supercharged or 4.5 liter non-supercharged
