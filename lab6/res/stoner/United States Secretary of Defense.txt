The secretary of defense is appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the Senate, and is by custom a member of the Cabinet and by law a member of the National Security Council.The secretary of defense is a statutory office, and the general provision in 10 U.S.C. ยง 113 provides that "subject to the direction of the President", its occupant has "authority, direction and control over the Department of Defense".
