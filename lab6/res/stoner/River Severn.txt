River Severn
The River Severn (Welsh: Afon Hafren) is the longest river in Great Britain at a length of 220 miles (354 km). With an average discharge of 107 m3/s (3,800 cu ft/s) at Apperley, Gloucestershire, it has by far the greatest water flow in England and Wales. The Severn rises at an altitude of 2,001 feet (610 m) on Plynlimon, close to the Ceredigion/Powys border near Llanidloes, in the Cambrian Mountains of mid Wales. It then flows through Shropshire, Worcestershire and Gloucestershire, with the county towns of Shrewsbury, Worcester and Gloucester on its banks. The Severn's drainage basin area is 4,409 square miles (11,419 km2), excluding the River Wye and Bristol Avon which flow into the Severn Estuary. The major tributaries to the Severn are the Vyrnwy, Tern, Teme, Warwickshire Avon and Worcestershire Stour. The river is usually considered to become the Severn Estuary after the Second Severn Crossing between Severn Beach, South Gloucestershire and Sudbrook, Monmouthshire, which discharges into the Bristol Channel and then into the Celtic Sea and the wider Atlantic Ocean. Etymology and mythology The name Severn is thought to derive from a Celtic original name *sabrinnƒÅ, of uncertain meaning, possibly from *samarina, "land of summer fallow". That
