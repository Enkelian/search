The double A-side debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart and remained there for five weeks, topped the Irish Singles Chart for six weeks, and reached number 16 in Germany. "These Are the Days" by itself topped Poland's LP3 chart for fourteen non-consecutive weeks. The song was awarded a Brit Award for British Single of the Year in 1992.Ron Hart of Rolling Stone writes, "the conga-driven synth ballad "These Are the Days of Our Lives" is Innuendoâ€˜s most significant single, given that it was released on Mercury's 45th birthday, and that its video marked the last time his fans were able to see the singer alive, as it was filmed in May
