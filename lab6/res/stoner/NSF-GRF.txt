As of 2019 the fellowship provides an honorarium of $12,000 to be placed towards the cost of tuition and fees at the university the fellow attends; it also awards the student directly with an annual $34,000 stipend for three years leading to an anticipated award amount of $138k. Each recipient could previously apply for a one time only travel award for $1,000.
