Folklore (Big Big Train Album)
Folklore is the ninth studio album by the English progressive rock band Big Big Train. Released on 27 May 2016, it was recorded at English Electric Studios, produced by Big Big Train, and mixed and mastered at Aubitt Studios by Rob Aubrey. It is the first studio album to feature Rachel Hall and then-Beardfish lead vocalist Rikard Sj√∂blom as official members. The album was released in multiple formats: standard and High Res downloads, as a single CD, and as a double-LP vinyl release that features two additional tracks, "Mudlarks" and "Lost Rivers of London", both of which were previously released on the 2015 EP Wassail. Both versions of the album contain the title track from Wassail, meaning that the vinyl release features all three of the original songs on the EP. Reception Reviews were largely positive for this release, the ProgReport saying "from the first listen is so breathtaking and magnificent, that more listens are welcomed". Concluding with "All in all, this is a sprawling collection of brilliantly told stories with even more impressive music".
