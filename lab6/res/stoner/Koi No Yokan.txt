Koi No Yokan
Koi No Yokan is the seventh studio album by American alternative metal band Deftones, released on November 12, 2012 by Reprise Records. Its title is a phrase from Japanese language "恋の予感", translating to "premonition of love".Koi No Yokan was met with widespread acclaim from critics upon its release, and debuted at number eleven on the US Billboard 200, selling over 65,000 copies in its first week of sales. According to Nielsen SoundScan, it has sold over 200,000 copies to date in the United States. Background Band frontman Chino Moreno characterized the album as "dynamic" with a full range of noise, noting an increased contribution of ideas by bassist Sergio Vega compared to their previous record, Diamond Eyes.A major change in the recording process came with the use of the Fractal Audio Systems Axe-Fx preamp/effects processor, which creates the sound of multiple outboard amps and pedals and allowed for different tones. Vega said the group was able to "bring Fractal into hotel rooms and run it into software and record ideas and flesh them out later". The group tracked guitar, bass and vocals, then recorded drums and replaced the guitar, bass and vocals. Vega confirmed that "everything was organic". Composition Described
