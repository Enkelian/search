Slovak Football Association
The Slovak Football Association (Slovak: Slovenský futbalový zväz, SFZ) is the governing body of football in Slovakia based in Bratislava. It has the ultimate responsibility for the control and development of football in Slovakia and is the body that runs the Slovakia national football teams. It was founded on 4 November 1938 and originally became a member of FIFA in 1939, but disbanded after World War II because Czech and Slovak football competitions combined, and so did the national teams. Following the breakup of Czechoslovakia, the organisation was reformed, joining the European governing body, UEFA, in 1993 and rejoining FIFA in 1994. National teams The Slovak Football Association runs the Slovakia national football team, as well as male youth teams at under-21, under-19, under-18, under-17, under-16 and under-15 level. In addition to this, it also organises the Slovakia women's national football team. Slovakia have played in two major tournaments since the breakup of Czechoslovakia: the 2010 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2016, reaching round of sixteen in both. Slovakia were also represented in the 2000 Summer Olympics football tournament, where they were eliminated in the group stage, following a semi-final appearance by their under-21 team in the 2000 UEFA
