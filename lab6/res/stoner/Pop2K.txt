Pop2K
Pop2K (formerly XM Hitlist) is a commercial-free all-2000s radio station that is broadcast on Sirius XM Radio. It is located on channel 10 (previously 30), and Dish Network 6010 and 099-10. It plays a range of top 40 hits in the 21st century similar to Venus. Some music would come from the late 1990s (prior to March 2009, the channel would play music from 1997 and 1998, but 1999 titles continue on the playlist). The channel is also used for XM's annual pop music chronology, IT. Starting in late 2009, the station started to play more deeper cuts and not the popular hits from the decade, to give it a more or less nostalgic flavor that the decades stations have. By 2010, no new 2010s music has been played unless it is left over from 2009 (for example, "Tik Tok" by Kesha was a number-one song in 2010 but was released in 2009), making it a 2000s-only station. By December 18, 2009, Mediabase stopped reporting the channel's playlist. The station gets its name from Y2K, the nickname for the year 2000. History XM Hitlist was originally created as a commercial-free alternative to Clear Channel's CHR hits station on XM, KISS,
