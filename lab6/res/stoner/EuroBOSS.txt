EuroBOSS
The BOSS GP Series is a motor racing series in Europe. The category originated in 1995 as the BOSS Formula series and evolved into the EuroBOSS Series. BOSS is an acronym that stands for Big Open Single Seaters. History The BOSS series was founded in 1995 under the regulations of the RAC Motor Sports Association and raced mainly in Great Britain. Later it was renamed to European BOSS (shortened by the competitors to EuroBOSS) following the involvement of Paul Stoddart's European Aviation and their expansion into European circuits. It mainly saw grids of around 12â€“15 cars but on occasions dropped as few as five cars have competed. Common EuroBOSS entries include Formula One machines from Benetton, Jordan, Tyrrell, Minardi and on occasions a V12 Ferrari has appeared. Other frequent entrants are Lola and Reynard CART chassis, the 1997-2002 Panoz (aka G-Force) and Dallara IndyCar chassis, and from 2012, the 2003-2011 Dallara and Panoz Champ Car chassis after the new IndyCar formula began. The Panoz Champ Car DP01 chassis from 2007 is also now legal. After the 2009 season, drivers Marijn van Kalmthout, Klaas Zwart, Henk de Boer and Frits van Eerd decided to split off and organize their own race
