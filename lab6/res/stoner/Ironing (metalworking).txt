Ironing (metalworking)
Ironing is a sheet metal forming process that uniformly thins the workpiece in a specific area. This is a very useful process when employed in combination with deep drawing to produce a uniform wall thickness part with greater height-to-diameter ratio. One example of ironing can be found in the manufacture of aluminum beverage cans, which are actually pressed from flat sheets of thicker material.
