Chi Psi
Chi Psi (ΧΨ) is a fraternity consisting of active chapters (known as "Alphas") at 32 American colleges and universities. The mission of the Chi Psi Fraternity is to create and maintain an enduring society which encourages the sharing of traditions and values, respect for oneself and others, and responsibility to the university and community. Chi Psi was founded on Thursday May 20, 1841, by 10 students at Union College in Schenectady, New York with the idea of emphasizing the fraternal and social principles of a brotherhood. It was the first Greek-letter organization to be founded on these grounds, rather than the literary characteristics of the seven then-existing societies. In 1846, Chi Psi was the first fraternity in the nation to establish a fraternity house. The first fraternity house was located at the University of Michigan. Thanks to the building's resemblance to a hunting lodge, Chi Psi now refers to all its houses as Lodges.Chi Psi's official colors are Royal Purple and Gold. Chi Psi's national headquarters, the Central Office, is in Nashville, Tennessee.
