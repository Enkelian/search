Yorkshire Philosophical Society
The Yorkshire Philosophical Society (YPS) is a charitable learned society (charity reg. 529709) which aims to promote the public understanding of the natural sciences, the social sciences, and the archaeology and history of York and Yorkshire. History The Society was formed in York in December 1822 by James Atkinson, William Salmond, Anthony Thorpe and William Vernon. The Society's aim was to gain and spread knowledge related to science and history and they built a large collection for this purpose. The geologist John Phillips was employed as the Society's first keeper of its museum. In 1828 the Society was given, by royal grant, some of the grounds of St Mary's Abbey including the ruins of the abbey. On this land the Society constructed a number of buildings including the Yorkshire Museum built to house the Society's geological and archaeological collections and opened in 1830. Landscape architect Sir John Murray Naysmith was commissioned by the Society to create a botanical gardens around the museum during the 1830s.
