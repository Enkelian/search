Population density
Population density (in agriculture: standing stock and standing crop) is a measurement of population per unit area, or exceptionally unit volume; it is a quantity of type number density. It is frequently applied to living organisms, most of the time to humans. It is a key geographical term. In simple terms, population density refers to the number of people living in an area per square kilometre. Biological population densities Population density is population divided by total land area or water volume, as appropriate.Low densities may cause an extinction vortex and lead to further reduced fertility. This is called the Allee effect after the scientist who identified it. Examples of the causes of reduced fertility in low population densities are: Increased problems with locating sexual mates Increased inbreeding Human densities For humans, population density is the number of people per unit of area, usually quoted per square kilometre or square mile, and which may include or exclude for example areas of water or glaciers. Commonly this may be calculated for a county, city, country, another territory or the entire world. The world's population is around 7,500,000,000 and Earth's total area (including land and water) is 510,000,000 km2 (197,000,000 sq. mi.). Therefore,
