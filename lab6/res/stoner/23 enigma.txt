23 enigma
The 23 enigma is a belief in the significance of the number 23. Origins Robert Anton Wilson cites William S. Burroughs as the first person to believe in the 23 enigma. Wilson, in an article in Fortean Times, related the following anecdote: I first heard of the 23 enigma from William S Burroughs, author of Naked Lunch, Nova Express, etc. According to Burroughs, he had known a certain Captain Clark, around 1960 in Tangier, who once bragged that he had been sailing 23 years without an accident. That very day, Clarkâ€™s ship had an accident that killed him and everybody else aboard. Furthermore, while Burroughs was thinking about this crude example of the irony of the gods that evening, a bulletin on the radio announced the crash of an airliner in Florida, USA. The pilot was another Captain Clark and the flight was Flight 23. In literature The 23 enigma can be seen in: Robert Anton Wilson and Robert Shea's book, The Illuminatus! Trilogy (therein called the "23/17 Phenomenon") Wilson's Cosmic Trigger I: The Final Secret of the Illuminati (therein called "the Law of Fives" or "the 23 Enigma") Arthur Koestler's contribution to The Challenge of Chance: A Mass Experiment
