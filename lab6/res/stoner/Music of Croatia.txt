Music of Croatia
The music of Croatia, like the divisions of the country itself, has two major influences: Central European, present in central and northern parts of the country including Slavonia, and Mediterranean, present in coastal regions of Dalmatia and Istria. In Croatia both pop and rock are popular, as well as pop music influenced by Dalmatian or Slavonian folk elements. Since the mid-20th century, schlager and chanson-inspired music have formed the backbone of the Croatian popular music.

They reveal a wealth of various influences and liturgical traditions that converged in this region (Dalmatian liturgy in Benevento script, Northern Gregorian chant, and original Glagolitic chant). Renaissance and baroque Early in the 15th century, the ideas of Humanism in Croatia brought about changes to the world of music. Interest in music began to spread outside of monastic and church walls with growing influence of new spiritual tendencies from Central European and particularly Italian cities.
