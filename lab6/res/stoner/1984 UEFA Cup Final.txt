1984 UEFA Cup Final
The 1984 UEFA Cup Final was a football tie played on 9 May and 23 May 1984 between R.S.C. Anderlecht of Belgium—the defending Champions—and Tottenham Hotspur F.C. of England. Tottenham won 4–3 on penalty kicks after the tie finished 2–2 on aggregate. Years later, it emerged that Anderlecht's passage to the final had involved the club's chairman paying a bribe totalling £27,000 to the referee for the semi-final against Nottingham Forest. A dubious penalty was awarded to Anderlecht, whilst a Forest goal was controversially disallowed. Match details First leg Second leg See also 1983–84 UEFA Cup R.S.C.
