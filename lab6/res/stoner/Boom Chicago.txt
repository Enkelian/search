Boom Chicago
Boom Chicago is an international creative group, based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, that writes and performs sketch and improvisational comedy at the Rozentheater.The group was founded in 1993 by Americans Andrew Moskos, Pep Rosenfeld and Ken Schaefle, who named it after their hometown and the home of improvisation. In 1994, they moved from the Iboya on the Korte Leidsedwarsstraat to the Lijnbaansgracht in the space that later became the Sugar Factory and Lovelee. In 1998, they took over and restored the Leidseplein Theater in the city's theater and club district. In 2012, the comedy show moved to their more spacious home on the Rozengracht, while the Chicago Social Club remains at the Leidseplein. Today the group performs their own shows or hosts outside productions at the Rozentheater. The venue with two theaters also houses Boom Chicago for Business and their training arm, the Boom Chicago Academy. Boom Chicago addresses Dutch, American and world social and political issues like privacy, the role of technology, Europe, the extreme right, Pim Fortuyn, 9/11, social media and the gig economy. Their unique mixing of comedy styles combined with technology has been popular with audiences and critics alike. 2019's The Future is Here... And it
