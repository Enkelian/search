Food industry
The food industry is a complex, global collective of diverse businesses that supplies most of the food consumed by the world's population. Only subsistence farmers, those who survive on what they grow, and hunter-gatherers can be considered outside the scope of the modern food industry. The food industry includes: Agriculture: raising crops, livestock, and seafood Manufacturing: agrichemicals, agricultural construction, farm machinery and supplies, seed, etc. Food processing: preparation of fresh products for market, and manufacture of prepared food products Marketing: promotion of generic products (e.g., milk board), new products, advertising, marketing campaigns, packaging, public relations, etc. Wholesale and food distribution: logistics, transportation, warehousing Foodservice (which includes catering) Grocery, farmers' markets, public markets and other retailing Regulation: local, regional, national, and international rules and regulations for food production and sale, including food quality, food security, food safety, marketing/advertising, and industry lobbying activities Education: academic, consultancy, vocational Research and development: food technology Financial services: credit, insurance Definitions It is challenging to find an inclusive way to cover all aspects of food production and sale. The UK Food Standards Agency describes it thus: "...the whole food industry â€“ from farming and food production, packaging and distribution, to retail and catering."The Economic Research Service
