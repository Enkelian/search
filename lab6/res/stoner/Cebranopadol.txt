Cebranopadol
Cebranopadol (developmental code GRT-6005) is an opioid analgesic of the benzenoid class which is currently under development internationally by Grünenthal, a German pharmaceutical company, and its partner Depomed, a pharmaceutical company in the United States, for the treatment of a variety of different acute and chronic pain states. As of November 2014, it is in phase III clinical trials. Cebranopadol is unique in its mechanism of action as an opioid, binding to and activating all four of the opioid receptors; it acts as a full agonist of the μ-opioid receptor (Ki = 0.7 nM; EC50 = 1.2 nM; IA = 104%), and δ-opioid receptor (Ki = 18 nM; EC50 = 110 nM; IA = 105%), and as a partial agonist of the nociceptin receptor (Ki = 0.9 nM; EC50 = 13.0 nM; IA = 89%) and κ-opioid receptor (Ki = 2.6 nM; EC50 = 17 nM; IA = 67%). The EC50 values of 0.5–5.6 µg/kg when introduced intravenously and 25.1 µg/kg after oral administration.Cebranopadol shows highly potent and effective antinociceptive and antihypertensive effects in a variety of different animal models of pain. Notably, it has also been found to be more potent in models of chronic neuropathic pain than acute
