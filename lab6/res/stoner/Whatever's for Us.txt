Whatever's for Us
Whatever's for Us is the debut album of British singer-songwriter Joan Armatrading. The album was a collaboration between Armatrading and singer-songwriter Pam Nestor. At the time the two were musical partners and wrote over a hundred songs together. Joan Armatrading sings lead vocals and plays piano and acoustic guitar, while Pam Nestor co-wrote most of the songs. Background Whatever's For Us was produced by Gus Dudgeon and was recorded over two weeks at Château d'Hérouville studios (then called Strawberry Studios), in the Oise valley, near Paris, and then at Trident Studios London and Marquee Studios, also in London. It was originally released in November 1972 by Cube Records (HIFLY 12). Cube originally intended to call the album Joan Armatrading, but Pam Nestor fought against this, as she had worked on over 100 songs for the album over a period of two to three years, playing piano and singing on many of them, and at the time of the album's recording, the two writers considered themselves a duo. Armatrading later said: "Pam and I worked very hard on the music and the songs for this album". In the event, none of the songs featuring Pam Nestor playing or singing were chosen
