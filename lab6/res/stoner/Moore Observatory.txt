The observatory operates two research telescopes at the site, and a companion telescope at Mount Kent near Toowoomba, Australia. The observatory is located on the 200 acres (0.81 km2) Horner Wildlife Refuge.

Telescopes A 0.6 m (24 in) Ritchey–Chrétien telescope manufactured by RC Optical Systems was installed in August 2006. It is currently used to measure transiting exoplanets. Other research performed with the telescope includes observing the physical process of nebula. Two identical 0.5 m (20 in) modified Dall–Kirkham telescopes at Moore Observatory and at Mount Kent are collaboratively operated by U of L and the University of Southern
