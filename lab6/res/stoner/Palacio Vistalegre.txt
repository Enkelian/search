Palacio Vistalegre
The Palacio Vistalegre is a multipurpose arena located in Madrid, Spain. It was built on the site of the former bullring, "Plaza de toros de Vista Alegre", built in 1906 and demolished in 1995. The venue is composed of three main spaces: The Arena, The Center and the Sala San Miguel (formerly known as The Box). History In 1980, the original bullring closed, and the site stood empty until plans were unveiled in 1996 for the modern arena, which would also be capable of staging bullfights. The arena was opened in 2000, offering a seating capacity of 14,000 and has 1,015 parking places.
