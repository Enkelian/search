McCune–Reischauer
McCune–Reischauer romanization () is one of the two most widely used Korean language romanization systems. A modified version of McCune–Reischauer was the official romanization system in South Korea until 2000, when it was replaced by the Revised Romanization of Korean system. A variant of McCune–Reischauer is still used as the official system in North Korea.The system was created in 1937 by George M. McCune and Edwin O. Reischauer. With a few exceptions, it attempts not to transliterate Korean hangul but to represent the phonetic pronunciation. Characteristics and criticism McCune–Reischauer fails to distinguish between voiced and voiceless consonants when the apostrophe is removed. In Korean, ㅂ is pronounced as B, almost identical to English B as in Bus, but McCune–Reischauer assigns ㅂ as p (unaspirated p), which forces people to pronounce bus as pus when there is no apostrophe. Likewise, ㄱ,ㄷ and ㅈ has been assigned as k, t and ch (unaspirated k,t and ch respectively) instead of g, d and j. This romanization forced people to pronounce gold, Donald and James as kold, Tonald and Chames when apostrophe was omitted, especially on the internet. In order to correct this problem, National Academy of the Korean Language developed the Revised Romanization
