Medial palpebral ligament
The medial palpebral ligament (medial canthal tendon) is about 4 mm in length and 2 mm in breadth. Its anterior attachment is to the frontal process of the maxilla in front of the lacrimal groove, and its posterior attachment is the lacrimal bone. Laterally, it is attached to the tarsus of the upper and lower eyelids. Crossing the lacrimal sac, it divides into two parts, upper and lower, each attached to the medial end of the corresponding tarsus. As the ligament crosses the lacrimal sac, a strong aponeurotic lamina is given off from its posterior surface; this expands over the sac, and is attached to the posterior lacrimal crest.
