Middle America (United States)
Middle America is a colloquial term for the United States heartland, especially the culturally rural and suburban areas of the United States, typically the Midwestern and Southern United States. Middle America is generally used as both a geographic and cultural label, suggesting a Central United States small town or suburb where most people are middle class or upper middle class, Evangelical or Mainline Protestant and typically of Northwestern European/Northern European descent, particularly Anglo-Saxon Protestant, Ulster Scot or Germanic descent. As a geographical label Geographically, the label Middle America refers to the territory between the East Coast of the United States (particularly the northeast) and the West Coast. The term has been used in some cases to refer to the inland portions of coastal states, especially if they are rural. Alternately, the term is used to describe the central United States. As a cultural label Middle America is contrasted with the more culturally progressive urban areas of the country, particularly, those of the East and West Coasts. The conservative values considered typical of Middle America (often called "family values" in American politics) are often called "Middle American values".The plots of such American films as Sweet Home Alabama and The Judge center
