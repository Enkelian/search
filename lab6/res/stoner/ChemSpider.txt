ChemSpider
ChemSpider is a database of chemicals. ChemSpider is owned by the Royal Society of Chemistry. Database The database contains information on more than 77 million molecules from over 270 data sources including: EPA DSSTox U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Human Metabolome Database Journal of Heterocyclic Chemistry KEGG KUMGM LeadScope LipidMAPS Marinlit MDPI MICAD MLSMR MMDB MOLI MTDP Nanogen Nature Chemical Biology NCGC NIAID National Institutes of Health (NIH) NINDS Approved Drug Screening Program NIST NIST Chemistry WebBook NMMLSC NMRShiftDB PANACHE PCMD PDSP Peptides Prous Science Drugs of the Future QSAR R&D Chemicals San Diego Center for Chemical Genomics SGCOxCompounds, SGCStoCompounds SMID Specs Structural Genomics Consortium SureChem Synthon-Lab Thomson Pharma Total TOSLab Building-Blocks UM-BBD UPCMLD UsefulChem Web of Science xPharmEach chemical is given a unique identifier, which forms part of a corresponding URL. For example, acetone is 175, and thus has the URL http://www.chemspider.com/Chemical-Structure.175.html Crowdsourcing The ChemSpider database can be updated with user contributions including chemical structure deposition, spectra deposition and user curation. This is a crowdsourcing approach to develop an online chemistry database. Crowdsourced based curation of the data has produced a dictionary of chemical names associated with chemical structures that has been used in text-mining applications of the
