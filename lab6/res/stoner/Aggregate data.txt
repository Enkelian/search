Aggregate data
In statistics, aggregate data are data combined from several measurements. When data is aggregated, groups of observations are replaced with summary statistics based on those observations.In a data warehouse, the use of aggregate data dramatically reduces the time to query large sets of data. Developers pre-summarize queries that are regularly used, such as Weekly Sales across several dimensions such as by item hierarchy or geographical hierarchy. In economics, aggregate data or data aggregates are high-level data that are composed from a multitude or combination of other more individual data, such as: in macroeconomics, data such as the overall price level or overall inflation rate; and in microeconomics, data of an entire sector of an economy composed of many firms, or of all households in a city or region. == References ==
