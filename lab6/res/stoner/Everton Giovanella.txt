Everton Giovanella
Everton Giovanella (born 13 September 1970) is a Brazilian retired footballer who played as a defensive midfielder. He was best known for tireless physical display, and played most of his professional career in Spain – one full decade – namely being an important part in Celta's domestic and European consolidation. Club career Giovanella was born in Caxias do Sul, Rio Grande do Sul. Having started playing with a modest club in native Brazil he signed with Série A's Sport Club Internacional in Porto Alegre, with little impact. In the middle of 1993 he emigrated to Portugal, playing one season each with Primeira Liga sides F.C. Tirsense, G.D. Estoril Praia and C.F. Os Belenenses. For the 1996–97 campaign Giovanella moved to Spain, first achieving La Liga promotion with UD Salamanca then moving to RC Celta de Vigo. At both teams, he reunited with former Belenenses teammate Catanha and, with the Galicians, played an important role in their domestic and European exploits, but also unluckily injured Deportivo de La Coruña's Manuel Pablo in a derby on 30 September 2001.In December 2004 (sanction ratified in September 2005), Giovanella was banned from football for two years after testing positive for nandrolone.
