Household income in the United States
Household income is an economic standard that can be applied to one household, or aggregated across a large group such as a county, city, or the whole country.

A key measure of household income is the "real median" statistic. "Real", indicating adjustment has been made for changes to the price of goods and services across time. "Median", indicating half of households have income above that level and half below. According to the U.S. Census, this measure was $63,179 for Americans in 2018.
