Blue Murder (album)
Blue Murder is the debut album by the hard rock band Blue Murder, released in 1989. It reached #69 on the Billboard 200 in June 1989. Legacy The back of the album states that it is dedicated to Phil Lynott. John Sykes had played with Thin Lizzy in the past, and often credits Lynott with being a huge inspiration. Many of the lyrical themes contained in the album echo those of Thin Lizzy as well. Track listing All songs written by John Sykes, except where indicated.

Later pressings corrected this, removing any reference to the song. Personnel Blue MurderJohn Sykes - guitars, lead
