Reser Stadium
Reser Stadium is an outdoor athletic stadium in the northwest United States, on the campus of Oregon State University in Corvallis, Oregon. It is the home of the Oregon State Beavers of the Pac-12 Conference, and opened 67 years ago in 1953 as Parker Stadium. It was renamed in 1999, and its current seating capacity is 43,154. The FieldTurf playing field runs northwest to southeast, at an approximate elevation of 240 feet (73 m) above sea level, with the press box above the grandstand on the southwest sideline. History and use From 1910 to 1953, the Beavers played their home games at Bell Field (now the site of the Dixon Recreation Center), and also played as many as four games a year at Multnomah Stadium in Portland. In 1948, Oregon State president August L. Strand, athletic director Spec Keene, and Portland businessman Charles T. Parker (1885â€“1977) met to plan a replacement for Bell Field. Parker, a 1907 alumnus, kicked off the stadium fundraising campaign in 1949 and made significant contributions of his own. In 1952, construction of the stadium began. For Parker's efforts and contributions, the stadium was named in his honor. The first game was played on Homecoming, November
