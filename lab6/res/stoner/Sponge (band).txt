History Vinnie Dombroski, Tim Cross, and Mike Cross were in a band called Loudhouse, fronted by vocalist Kenny Mugwump. After releasing only one album and having a song appear on the soundtrack to the 1991 film Point Break, the band added guitarist Joey Mazzola. After Mugwump decided to pursue a career in acting and directing, Dombroski switched from drums to vocals, and they recruited Jimmy Paluzzi to round out the lineup. The band then decided to start fresh and name themselves Sponge. Their debut album, Rotting Pi√±ata, released in 1994, was a major hit, received heavy play on radio and MTV, and was certified gold by the RIAA. The two biggest singles from that album were "Plowed" and "Molly". By the end of 1994 Charlie Grover had replaced drummer Paluzzi. Their follow-up album was called Wax
