Siris (goddess)
The Mesopotamian goddess Siris was the patron of beer who is conceived of as a demon, which is not necessarily evil. She is said to be the daughter of the goddess Ninkasi.Although beer as we know it had its origins in Mesopotamia, fermented beverages quickly spread around the world from Mesopotamia as the drink was shared with kings and rulers. Siris is considered the mother of Zu; a large bird that can breathe fire and water. == References ==
