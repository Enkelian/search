The Dark Sides
The Dark Sides is a compilation of King Diamond songs, released in 1988 by Roadrunner Records. This album contains five tracks (and an outro), released on previous albums, but are mostly unrelated in their stories (as King's albums were concept albums). Controversy The album cover featured King Diamond with face paint that resembled KISS bassist Gene Simmons' "Demon". Simmons claimed that King's face paint was copyright infringement and sued him. The lawsuit was eventually dropped when King changed his design.
