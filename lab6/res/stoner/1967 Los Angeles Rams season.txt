Under second-year head coach George Allen, the Rams had a regular season record of 11–1–2, tied for the best in the league, and won the Coastal Division title. Offseason NFL draft Roster Regular season The Los Angeles Rams entered the 1967 season with renewed optimism. For years they had been a poor team, but the hiring of coach George Allen helped turn things around. In his first season in 1966, the Rams finished at 8–6, their first winning season since 1958. The Rams won their first two games and faced a big test in Dallas on October 1 against the powerful Cowboys, the defending Eastern Conference champions. It was no contest at the sold-out Cotton Bowl, as the Rams won 35–13, but they came home and stumbled in a 27–24 loss to the 49ers and fell a game behind the 4–0 Baltimore Colts. Los Angeles went east to Baltimore and played to a 24–24 tie. Remarkably, both teams tied their next game as well; the Rams tied the Washington Redskins while the Colts tied the Minnesota Vikings.
