That Stubborn Kinda Fellow
That Stubborn Kinda Fellow is the second studio album by Marvin Gaye, released on the Tamla label in 1963. The second LP Gaye released on the label, it also produced his first batch of successful singles for the label and established Gaye as one of the label's first hit-making acts in its early years. Background Following the release of Gaye's first album, The Soulful Moods of Marvin Gaye, Gaye and Motown were in a struggle to agree with the direction his career should take. Despite the failure of Gaye's debut, which featured jazz and blues songs with only a few R&B songs, Gaye had no desire to have an R&B career, figuring he wouldn't get much exposure from a crossover audience singing R&B. Motown CEO Berry Gordy also had difficulty on how to present the music to the buying public. Though artists like The Miracles and Mary Wells had R&B success, they hardly were noticed by pop audiences. And while Motown's first signing act, Marv Johnson, was one of the label's earliest hitmakers, most of his music was released to United Artists, while Motown Recordings and its imprints Tamla, Motown and Gordy, had still not produced much success.
