Global Poverty Project
The Global Poverty Project is an international education and advocacy organisation working to catalyse the movement to end extreme poverty. The Project was founded by Hugh Evans and Simon Moss and aims to increase the number and effectiveness of people taking action to end extreme poverty. Vision The Global Poverty Project's vision is a world without extreme poverty, within a generation. To reach this end the Project utilises the power of education, communications, advocacy, campaigning and the media to try and advance the movement to end extreme poverty. They focus on building a global movement for change: mobilising people to make a difference now, and changing the systems and policies that keep people in poverty.They do this in two ways: • Campaigning for government, business and consumer action that will create important systemic change for the world's extreme poor, and • Building a movement that engages and educates people, and supports them to take simple but effective individual actions for change. History Since launching in 2008 the Project has: Developed 1.4 Billion Reasons – a multimedia presentation that explains the issues that contribute to extreme poverty, and what everyday people can do about them, Spoken to more than 100,000 people
