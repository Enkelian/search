Madea's Class Reunion
Madea's Class Reunion is a 2003 play, directed, written by, and starring Tyler Perry. The live performance that was released on DVD was taped in Detroit. Plot Tyler Perry's outrageous and tough granny character, Madea, is traveling to the Pandora Hotel, the venue for her 50-year class reunion. Running afoul of the law, Madea still manages to teach valuable lessons amidst the comedy and chaos, addressing the importance of forgiveness and the value of friendship. In addition to Madea, the insane bellboy/bartender, "Dr." Willie Leroy Jones (new character played by Perry), is causing ruckus in the already rowdy hotel before she even arrives. Willie is suffering from an unknown number of Mental illnesses claiming at times to be on lithium, Prozac, and Xanax and is likely criminally insane as he mentions a probation officer. Madea, her daughter Cora, and her colorful crazy neighbor and classmate, Mr. Brown (whose wife from the previous play, Mattie, died from Alzheimer's complications and was cremated) help married couple Corey and Trina Jeffrey (Terrell Carter, Pamela Taylor) come to terms with infidelity. A woman Stephanie (Cheryl "Pepsii" Riley) hurt by years of sexual and chemical torment must give up prostituting herself with her abusive husband
