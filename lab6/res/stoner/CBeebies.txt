The domestic CBeebies channel broadcasts from 6:00 a.m. to 7:00 pm each dayâ€“ a result of the channel sharing bandwidth with the channel BBC Four on the Freeview platform. The station was joined in March 2007 by an audio CBeebies Radio, which broadcast for three hours each day on the radio station BBC Radio 7, however since the station was rebranded as BBC Radio 4 Extra in April 2011, this obligation has ceased. CBeebies Radio, however, has continued as a feature on the channel's website since 2013, and as a station on BBC Sounds broadcasting from 6am to 10pm. A magazine called CBeebies Weekly (now called CBeebies Magazine) was first published in 2006. Since 27 March 2013, CBeebies has been carried by the British Forces Broadcasting Service, sharing a channel with BFBS Extra. The UK channel is also available in the Republic of Ireland.
