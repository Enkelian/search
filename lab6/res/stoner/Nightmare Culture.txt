Nightmare Culture was a 12" split vinyl by Current 93 and Sickness Of Snakes. This was the only release for "Sickness Of Snakes" as members John Balance and Peter Christopherson formed Coil by the time this record was originally pressed. The other member of Sickness Of Snakes was Boyd Rice. The first pressing was limited to 5000 copies with a seal on the cover. The second pressing came out in 1988. It came without an insert and with different center labels. For this release Current 93 were: David Tibet, Ruby Wallis, Steven Stapleton, John Balance, Steve Ignorant and John Murphy. The Current 93 song was later pressed on the CD reissue of "In Menstrual Night". The Sickness Of Snakes songs were later released on the Coil compilation Unnatural History. "His Body Was A Playground For The Nazi Elite" (issued later on CD) then appeared on the NON album Easy Listening for Iron Youth as "Predator/Prey". "Various Hands" later appeared on the Boyd Rice album The Way I Feel' under the title "Many Hands". The vinyl is etched as follows: Side A: Time for tea and feed the thing.
