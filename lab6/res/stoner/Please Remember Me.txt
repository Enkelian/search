Please Remember Me
"Please Remember Me" is a song co-written by American country music artists Rodney Crowell and Will Jennings. Originally recorded by Crowell for his 1995 album Jewel of the South, his version was released as its lead (and only) single and peaked at number 69 on the Billboard country chart in early June. A later version was released by Aaron Neville and Linda Ronstadt, but was not released as a single. Chart performance Tim McGraw version Four years after the release of his own version, Crowell selected several songs which he recommended to record producer Byron Gallimore. Eventually, "Please Remember Me" made its way to Tim McGraw, who recorded it for his 1999 album A Place in the Sun. Released that year as the first single from that album, McGraw's rendition reached the top of the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts, a position that it held for five weeks. The song was also McGraw's biggest solo hit on the Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked at number 10. McGraw's rendition features Patty Loveless on harmony vocals. Critical reception Deborah Evans Price, of Billboard magazine reviewed the song favorably, calling it a "lush and lovely ballad."
