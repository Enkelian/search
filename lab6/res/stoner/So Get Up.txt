So Get Up
"So Get Up", written and vocalized by Ithaka, also known as Ithaka Darin Pappas, is a 1993 spoken-word electronic dance music vocal-poem more frequently credited to the Portuguese house music production duo Underground Sound of Lisbon and the German trance music duo Cosmic Gate. Ithaka Darin Pappas lived and recorded in Lisbon, Portugal, from 1992 to 1998. His poem "So Get Up" (then entitled "So Get Up, The End Of The Earth Is Upon Us") was written and first vocalized in January 1993 for a program called Quarto Bairro on RÃ¡dio Comercial in Lisbon. The station's radio presenter, Pedro Costa, recorded Ithaka's voice live on-air. Two months later, in March 1993, a techno-pop demo was made in Manchester, England, with a student engineer-producer. The initial 'publicly released, physically manufactured' musical element backing the poem was created in 1994 by DJ Vibe and Doctor J aka Underground Sound of Lisbon (or USL) who invited Ithaka (at that time using an alias name, Korvowrong) to re-record the poem as a guest vocalist on their first release.USL's nine-minute progressive house version of "So Get Up" appeared on the B-side of their "Chapter One" 12-inch vinyl release. In Portugal this was distributed by Kaos
