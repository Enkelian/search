Just Say Ozzy
Just Say Ozzy is a live EP by Ozzy Osbourne. It was released on March 17, 1990 and was remastered on August 22, 1995. Overview The sleeve states that Just Say Ozzy was recorded at London's Brixton Academy. The music, however, was re-recorded and mixed at Electric Lady Studios in New York with engineer Adam Yellin and the audience noise and some tracks kept from the live recording.The album—along with The Ultimate Sin and Live & Loud—has since been deleted from Ozzy's catalog and was not remastered and reissued along with the rest of Ozzy's albums in 2002. This is mainly due to a continuing legal struggle with bassist/songwriter Phil Soussan over the song "Shot in the Dark". Just Say Ozzy peaked at number 58 on the Billboard 200 and was certified Gold on July 21, 1993.The tracks "Sweet Leaf" and "War Pigs" were composed and originally recorded by Black Sabbath, the group Osbourne fronted in the 1970s.
