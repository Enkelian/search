Latitude franco
Latitude Franco is a Sirius Canada channel (in response to XM Radio Canada's Air Musique channel) featuring new and emerging French Canadian music, such as punk, hip-hop, electronic and alternative rock music. It was born in September 2010 as a replacement for Ã‰nergie2 on the same channel, although that channel also played English music. The channel broadcasts in the French language, and like its predecessor, is owned by Astral Media. From the beginning until May 2011, it was on channel 89 until adopting channel 155 since then. Since Sirius Canada's merger with XM Radio Canada to form Sirius XM Canada, it is rumoured this channel will be phased out in favour of the similar Air Musique. External links Latitude Franco
