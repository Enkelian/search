Track layout The original track layout of Davidstow circuit was used in 1952 and contained three corners; most drivers thought that this layout was not very challenging. The track was 4.2 km (2.6 mi) long and used the main runways of RAF Davidstow Moor. The layout of Davidstow Circuit was changed for 1953. This layout was kept for 1954 and 1955 as well. The new layout contained a chicane before the first corner and was considerably shorter. This layout cut out the end of the original layout, which meant that this layout was only 3.1 km (1.9 mi) long. The start/finish straight remained in the same place
