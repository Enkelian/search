Air-Sea Dolphins
Air-sea Dolphin is the new musical project by Robert Schneider of The Apples in Stereo, James Husband (James Huggins) Of Montreal/Elf Power Ryan Sterritt and The Brothers Chaps. The group was started after Robert Schneider joined the Homestar Runner live band in 2016 as a new songwriting vehicle for his song ideas with the creative input of the Brothers Chaps & Co. to form a new group focused on 90s lo-fi 4-track recording with the addition of 8-bit style retro "video games" designed to accompany their music. An EP is in the works to follow up their three 7‚Äù singles & the group plans a full length LP in the near/past future depending on time/space continuum.
