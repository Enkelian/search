Euboea (regional unit)
Euboea (Greek: Περιφερειακή ενότητα Εύβοιας) is one of the regional units of Greece. It is part of the administrative region of Central Greece. It consists of the islands of Euboea and Skyros, as well as a 260 km² area on the Greek mainland. Its land area is 4,167.449 km², whereas the total land area of the municipalities actually on the island Euboea is 3,684.848 km², which includes that of numerous small offshore islets (Petalies Islands) near Euboea's southern tip. Administration The Euboea regional unit is subdivided into 8 municipalities, numbered in the picture in the infobox. These are: Chalcis (Chalkida, 1) Dirfys-Messapia (2) Eretria (3) Istiaia-Aidipsos (4) Karystos (5) Kymi-Aliveri (6) Mantoudi-Limni-Agia Anna (7) Skyros (8) Prefecture As a part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform, the former Euboea Prefecture (Greek: Νομός Εύβοιας) was transformed into a regional unit within the Central Greece region, without any change in boundaries. At the same time, the municipalities were reorganised, according to the table below. Note: the former municipalities of Anthidona and Avlida are on the mainland, attached to the northeastern part of Boeotia. Skyros is an island by itself.
