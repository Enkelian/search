Amanita (album)
Amanita is the second studio album by American rock band Bardo Pond, released on April 3, 1996. It was released as a single CD and cassette on Matador Records, their first release on the label, and as a double vinyl LP on Drunken Fish Records with two bonus tracks. Counting their four early self-released cassettes, this is the band's sixth or seventh album, but is generally viewed as their third officially-released album. Background The album title refers to the highly toxic mushroom genus Amanita, a few of which have hallucinogenic properties. (The pre-release cassette was entitled The High Frequency, causing the album to occasionally still be called this.) "RM" is named after one of the band's father figures and collaborators (as Hash Jar Tempo), New Zealand guitarist Roy Montgomery. A Drunken Fish mail-order catalog described the album thus: As the resin oozes on, sticking everything in its path to the couch, Bardo stumbles into the 2nd phase of a full length zone-out. Limp-lidded guitars are in more abundance than ever, courses are being plotted with the controls set for the heart of the bowl, and somewhere deep inside a 'rock' band has emerged... however baked it may be.
