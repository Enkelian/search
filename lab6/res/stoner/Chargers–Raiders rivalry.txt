Chargers–Raiders rivalry
The Chargers–Raiders rivalry is a National Football League (NFL) rivalry between the Los Angeles Chargers and Las Vegas Raiders. Since the American Football League (AFL) was established in 1960, the Chargers and the Raiders have shared the same division, first being the AFL Western Conference, and since the AFL–NFL merger, the AFC West. Like the 49ers–Rams rivalry in the NFC West, this rivalry once represented the geographic and cultural differences between Northern California (represented by the Raiders while they were based in Oakland, California) and Southern California (represented by the Chargers), though the Raiders once played in Los Angeles while the Chargers were in San Diego, highlighting the difference between those two southern California cities. Although the rivalry lost its in-state significance when the Raiders relocated to Las Vegas, Nevada before the 2020 season, the teams’ new home stadiums are now about 100 miles closer to each other than in years past. History The Chargers and Raiders were both charter members of the American Football League when the league began playing in 1960. The Chargers moved to San Diego after their first year in Los Angeles, appearing in four of the first five AFL Championship games and winning one. Al
