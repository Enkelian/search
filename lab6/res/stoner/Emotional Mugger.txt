Critical reception The album has a Metascore at Metacritic of a 79 out of 100 from 19 reviews. Mark Deming for AllMusic writing "As Segall's profile has risen in the 2010s, it's a welcome thing that he hasn't diluted his musical vision and is still willing to let his music howl when the spirit moves him, and Emotional Mugger is a stiff shot of raw, cocky joy that hits its target beautifully." Rob Sheffield in Rolling Stone saying "The San Francisco garage-punk wunderkind flaunts all his frantic energy and wild-eyed humor on Emotional Mugger." Annie Zaleski for Spin writing "This somewhat-disjointed philosophy adds just the right amount of friction and intrigue to Emotional Mugger, informing the music but not overwhelming it." Evan Minsker
