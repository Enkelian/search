The Friggs
The Friggs were a garage rock band from Camden, New Jersey active from 1990 to 2000. Its original members were Palmyra Delran (guitar) and Jezebel (singer/songwriter), the latter of whom was later replaced by Lexi Plumm. History The band played its first show in Philadelphia on New Year's Eve 1991/1992, and released their first single, a cover of The Troggs' "Come Now," in 1991, before playing any live shows. This was followed by several more singles and an EP, America's Only Rock & Roll Magazine Parody. The cover of this 1994 EP, which was produced by Ben Vaughn, closely mimicked the cover of an old issue of Creem. Late that year, Jezebel left the band, whereupon she was replaced by Lexi Plumm. Delran decided to hire Plumm after she was impressed by the sound of motorcycles on her answering machine. The band released their only album, Rock Candy, in 1997 on E-Vil Records. It was also produced by Vaughn. Rock Candy received positive reviews, which led to the band opening for Beck and Cheap Trick. The band performed at SXSW in 1997 and broke up in 2000.
