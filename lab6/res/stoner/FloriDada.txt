I was driving in L.A. and flipping through the radio dial and came across a morning radio show where they're just talking all the time. They had a segment called, like, 'Dumb Things People Are Doing In Florida.' It kind of bothered me. ... Everybodyâ€”they kind of agree that Florida's such a weird place, know what I mean? But in a way, that's part of the charm of it." Music video A music video was released in January 8, 2016. It was produced and directed by the Brooklyn, New York artist collective PFFR.
