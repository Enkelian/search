Keratea
Keratea (Greek: Κερατέα) is a town in East Attica, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Lavreotiki, of which it is a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of 129.864 km2. Legend has it that when the barbarians came to attack Greece at the land of Keratea, Zeus and Hades drew the coast together so they can talk and allowed only a strip of water in between. The Greeks were so very few so to give them a fighting chance Zeus and Hades summoned Poseidon and asked him to send waves bigger than the barbarian's ships. People from that time say that even the Hades himself fought on the side of the Greeks. So the sea by the land of Keratea is known as Kakia Thalassa (the Bad Sea) ever since. Geography Keratea is situated in the hills in the southeastern part of the Attica peninsula, 6 km west of the Aegean Sea coast, at about 200 m elevation. It lies at the northern foot of Mount Paneion. It is 5 km southeast of Kalyvia Thorikou, 12 km northwest of Lavrio and 29 km southeast of Athens city centre. Greek National Road
