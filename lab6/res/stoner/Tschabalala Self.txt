Tschabalala Self
Tschabalala Self (born 1990) is an American artist best known for her depictions of Black female figures using paint, fabric, and discarded pieces of her previous works. Though she uses mixed media, all of her works are on canvas and employ a "painting language." Inspired by works done by an African-American artist, Romare Bearden, Tschabalala Self creates collages of various items that she has collected over time and sews them together to depict black female bodies that “defy the narrow spaces in which they are forced to exist.”, which she derives from the history behind the African-American struggle and oppression in society. Self reclaims the black female body and portrays them to be free of stereotypes without having to fear being punished. Her goal is to “create alternative narratives around the black body”. Not only does Self’s work convey her own personal history, the method in which she uses in creating her work also has a history as well. African-Americans have a long history of using fabric and textiles to create art. The use of different fabrics to produce things, such as quilts, has become a part of the black culture. Much of Self’s work uses elements from this culture
