Air Madagascar
Société Nationale Malgache de Transports Aériens S.A., operating as Air Madagascar, is an airline based in Antananarivo, Madagascar. It is the national airline of Madagascar operating services to Europe, Asia and neighbouring African and Indian Ocean island destinations, from its main base, Ivato International Airport in Antananarivo. It also operates an extensive domestic network. The airline was formed in 1947 to feed into flights by Transports Aériens Intercontinentaux and Air France, and upon the independence of Madagascar, it became the national airline. Initially operating services on domestic routes, the airline saw expansion in the late 1960s and 1970s, when it began international flights to destinations such as France and South Africa. In recent years the airline has been a subject of failed privatisation measures. These are now on hold and the loss=making airline is majority owned by the Madagascar government.
