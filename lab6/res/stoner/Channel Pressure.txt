Channel Pressure
Channel Pressure is the debut studio album of electronic music duo Ford & Lopatin, consisting of producers Daniel Lopatin (aka Oneohtrix Point Never) and Joel Ford. Following the group's abandonment of their previous name "Games" for legal reasons, they recorded the album at Gary's Electric Studios in Brooklyn, New York. It was released on June 7, 2011 as the first album to be issued on Software, Lopatin's own label under the Mexican Summer imprint. Channel Pressure is a concept album about a teen named Joey Rogers who is brainwashed by voices from a supercomputer. Musically, the album draws on an eclectic variety of 1980s music styles, including electropop, white soul, R&B, jazz fusion, and new age, as well as cluttered and improved quality production techniques than heard on their previous releases. It features production and vocal contributions from Al Carlson, Autre Ne Veut, and Jeff Gitelman. The album was promoted with two singles, "Emergency Room" and "Too Much MIDI (Please Forgive Me)." Channel Pressure garnered favorable reviews from professional music journalists upon its release, and was number 18 on a year-end list of the best albums of 2011 by Gorilla vs. Bear.
