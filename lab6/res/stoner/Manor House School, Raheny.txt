Manor House School, Raheny
Manor House School is a large Roman Catholic second-level all-girls school in Raheny, Dublin, Ireland, attached to a convent, and with sporting facilities. The school had an enrolment of 773 in 2017. Location Manor House occupies a complex of red-brick buildings on the road from North Bull Island to Raheny village centre, formerly the site of a "big house," which was demolished in the early days of the school. The school site is bounded by the Santry River and Watermill Road. History The Catholic Parish of Raheny asked religious order the Poor Servants of the Mother of God to open a convent and schools in 1952, and the order, having agreed, bought Manor House in March 1952. The first element, a girls' primary school (National School), opened in 1953, and a fee-charging secondary school began with the new school year in 1956. Although the economy was on the rise, many parents could not afford the bi-annual payment. The secondary school grew, and the school part of the complex of buildings was extended in 1964 and 1977. By contrast, the primary school was closed. In 1967, Manor House joined the free education scheme. The Poor Servants of the Mother of God
