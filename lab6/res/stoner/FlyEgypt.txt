FlyEgypt
FlyEgypt is an Egyptian low-cost and charter airline headquartered in Cairo. History The airline was founded in 2014 as a single class charter operator and started operations on 12 February 2015 with a flight between Cairo and Jeddah. On 11 July 2015 it started a weekly seasonal service between ZÃ¼rich and Marsa Alam.On 5 November 2018, it was reported that the German aviation authority banned FlyEgypt - together with Air Cairo - from operating into Germany, where it flew on behalf of German tour operators, due to stricter catering regulations imposed on Egyptian carriers flying to Sharm El Sheikh. Shortly after, major European tour operators Thomas Cook Group and TUI Group announced they would no longer maintain contracts with these airlines for the same reason. However, the airline resolved the issue in a few days. FlyEgypt was granted approval to resume services to Germany on 23 December and continues to be in compliance with the new German regulations.
