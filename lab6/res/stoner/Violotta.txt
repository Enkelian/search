Violotta
A violotta is a tenor viola (or tenor violin) invented by the German luthier Alfred Stelzner and patented in 1891. It is tuned G2–D3–A3–E4, an octave below the violin. Other instruments called "tenor violin" were tuned a step lower: F2–C3–G3–D4 (a fifth below the viola).It is rarely used by composers. One of the few works where it is used is the String Quintet in A by Felix Draeseke. It is also used in Max von Schillings' opera Der Pfeifertag (1899), and in Sergei Taneyev's String Trio in E♭ major, Op. 31 (1911). Discography 1971? – Hurst, Alberta. Alberta Hurst, Tenor Violin.
