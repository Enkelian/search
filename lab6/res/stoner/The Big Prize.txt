The Big Prize
The Big Prize is the second album by Honeymoon Suite, released in 1986. It featured four hit singles, including the band's biggest hit in the U.S., "Feel It Again," and "Bad Attitude," which was notably featured in a sequence in the final episode of Miami Vice three years later. The album also certified Platinum in Canada by the CRIA (Canadian Recording Industry Association). The album cover features a newly married couple having their picture taken by some tourists at Niagara Falls, Honeymoon Suite's hometown. The photo was taken on the Canadian side of the Falls. Following the release of this album, the band won the Juno Award for "Group of the Year" and was also nominated for "Album of the Year" in 1986. In a 2008 interview, Honeymoon Suite's guitarist Derry Grehan said "I think our best record was The Big Prize." Background and writing Following the success of their debut album and a subsequent two-year tour, Honeymoon Suite wrote much of their next album on the road. The Big Prize was produced by Bruce Fairbairn with assistance from fellow Canadian Bob Rock and featured the trademark 80s sound of rock guitars interlaced with keyboards.
