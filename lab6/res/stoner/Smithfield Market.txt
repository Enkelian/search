Smithfield Market
Smithfield is a district in the City of London, located in Central London, England. The principal street of the area is West Smithfield.A number of City institutions are located in the area, such as St Bartholomew's Hospital, the Charterhouse, and Livery Halls, including those of the Butchers' and Haberdashers' Companies. Smithfield's meat market dates from the 10th century, and is now London's only remaining wholesale market in continuous operation since medieval times. The area also contains London's oldest surviving church, St Bartholomew-the-Great, founded in 1123 AD. Smithfield has borne witness to many executions of heretics and political rebels over the centuries, including Scottish patriot Sir William Wallace, and Wat Tyler, leader of the Peasants' Revolt, among many other religious reformers and dissenters. Smithfield Market, a Grade II listed-covered market building, was designed by Victorian architect Sir Horace Jones in the second half of the 19th century, and is the dominant architectural feature of the area. Some of its original market premises fell into disuse in the late 20th century and faced the prospect of demolition. The Corporation of London's public enquiry in 2012 drew widespread support for an urban regeneration plan intent upon preserving Smithfield's historical identity. Smithfield area In
