Live '84
Live '84 is an album released by Black Flag in 1984 on SST Records. It is a live recording of a show played in 1984 and features mostly tracks from My War and Slip It In. The album was recorded at the Stone nightclub in San Francisco, CA. A live video was shot simultaneously and was briefly available through SST; the now-out-of-print video has been widely bootlegged. The album was originally issued as a cassette-only release, almost simultaneously with Slip It In. In 1998, Greg Ginn remixed the album for CD reissue.
