Walk into Light
Walk into Light is the debut solo album released by Jethro Tull frontman Ian Anderson, released in 1983. (The album A was originally intended to be released as an Ian Anderson album, but instead was released as a Jethro Tull album.) Despite being an Ian Anderson solo album, the album was actually the most collaborative work Anderson had ever done, as then-Jethro Tull keyboardist Peter-John Vettese co-wrote five songs and had a strong influence on the album's style and sound.
