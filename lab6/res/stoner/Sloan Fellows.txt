Sloan Fellows
The Sloan Fellows program is the world's first mid-career and senior career master's degree in general management and leadership. It was initially supported by a grant from Alfred P. Sloan, the late CEO of General Motors, to his alma mater, MIT. The program was established in 1930 at the MIT Sloan School of Management. Later it was expanded to the Stanford Graduate School of Business (1957), and London Business School (1968). Considered to be one of the most prestigious management training programs in the world, it targets experienced leaders who have demonstrated success either within organizations, or independently as entrepreneurs. Notable alumni include Kofi Annan, former United Nations Secretary-General and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate (MIT, '72), Lord John Browne of Madingley, former chairman and CEO of BP and member of the British House of Lords (Stanford, '81), and Carly Fiorina, former CEO of Hewlett-Packard (MIT, '89).
