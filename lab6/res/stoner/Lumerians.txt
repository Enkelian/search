Lumerians
Lumerians is a San Francisco Bay Area-based quartet which has a psychedelic "mindbender" space rock sound. The group is notable for performances characterized by "transcendent live video projections" and having "incredible visuals", according to one music critic. One critic described the band as "Oakland's prize pony in the Bay Area gloom-folk horse race". The sound has been compared to Krautrock with overtones of 1960s music. History The band was founded by Tyler Green, Marc Melzer, Jason Miller and Chris Musgrave in 2006. Multi-instrumentalist Luis Vasquez joined in 2008. Early rehearsals and recordings were produced in San Francisco, but the group has since relocated to Oakland. They have their own recording studio in a converted church in Oakland, California. The band's sound was influenced by groups such as Sonic Youth, Krautrock groups such as Can and Neu!, and African and South American Psych music from the 1960s and 1970s. In mid-2011 Vasquez left the group to focus on his project The Soft Moon The Lumerians have worked with vocalist Rebecca Coseboom.
