2024 Summer Olympics
The 2024 Summer Olympics (French: Jeux olympiques d'été de 2024), officially known as the Games of the XXXIII Olympiad (French: Jeux de la XXXIIIe Olympiade), and commonly known as Paris 2024, is a forthcoming international multi-sport event that is scheduled to take place from 26 July to 11 August 2024 in Paris, France.Having previously played host in 1900 and 1924, Paris will become the second city to host the Olympics thrice, after London (1908, 1948 and 2012). 2024 will mark the centenary of the Paris Games of 1924, and see the sixth Olympic Games hosted by France (three each in summer & winter). The bidding process for these Games began in 2015. Five cities submitted their candidature, but Hamburg, Rome and Budapest withdrew, leaving only Paris and Los Angeles in contention. A proposal to elect the 2024 and 2028 Olympic host cities concurrently was approved by an Extraordinary IOC Session on 11 July 2017 in Lausanne. On 31 July 2017, the IOC agreed a deal that would see Paris host the Games in 2024 and Los Angeles four years later. The formal announcement of this decision took place at the 131st IOC Session in Lima, Peru, on 13 September 2017.
