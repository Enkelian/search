History In 1951, Port Adelaide courier Roger Baynes, in partnership with Len Croker, took over the Largs North Progressive Association's Progressive Times. In March 1951, the Progressive Times was relaunched as the Messenger. The Messenger originally operated out of a small room above a Port Adelaide bicycle shop. The business later moved to an old butcher's shop on Commercial Road, Port Adelaide. Baynes acquired more suburban titles across Adelaide during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s and rebranded them under the Messenger name. The original Messenger was renamed the Portside Messenger in 1984.
