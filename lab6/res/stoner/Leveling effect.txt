Leveling effect
Leveling effect or solvent leveling refers to the effect of solvent on the properties of acids and bases. The strength of a strong acid is limited ("leveled") by the basicity of the solvent. Similarly the strength of a strong base is leveled by the acidity of the solvent. When a strong acid is dissolved in water, it reacts with it to form hydronium ion (H3O+). An example of this would be the following reaction, where "HA" is the strong acid: HA + H2O → A− + H3O+Any acid that is stronger than H3O+ reacts with H2O to form H3O+. Therefore, no acid stronger than H3O+ exists in H2O. For example, aqueous perchloric acid (HClO4), aqueous hydrochloric acid (HCl) and aqueous nitric acid (HNO3) are all completely ionized, and are all equally strong acids.Similarly, when ammonia is the solvent, the strongest acid is ammonium (NH4+), thus HCl and a super acid exert the same acidifying effect. The same argument applies to bases. In water, OH− is the strongest base. Thus, even though sodium amide (NaNH2) is an exceptional base (pKa of NH3 ~ 33), in water it is only as good as sodium hydroxide. On the other hand, NaNH2 is a
