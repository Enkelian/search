East Village, Manhattan
The East Village is a neighborhood on the East Side of Lower Manhattan, New York City. It is roughly defined as the area east of the Bowery and Third Avenue, between 14th Street on the north and Houston Street on the south. The East Village contains three subsections: Alphabet City, in reference to the single-letter-named avenues that are located to the east of First Avenue; Little Ukraine, near Second Avenue and 6th and 7th Streets; and Bowery, located around the street of the same name. Initially, what is now the East Village was occupied by the Lenape Native Americans, and was then divided into plantations by Dutch settlers. During the early 19th century, the East Village contained many of the city's most opulent estates. By the middle of the century, it grew to include a large immigrant population—including what was once referred to as Manhattan's Little Germany—and was considered part of the nearby Lower East Side. By the late 1960s, many artists, musicians, students and hippies began to move into the area, and East Village was given its own identity. Since at least the 2000s, gentrification has changed the character of the neighborhood.East Village is part of Manhattan Community District
