Phi Sigma Pi
Phi Sigma Pi (ΦΣΠ) is a gender-inclusive national honor fraternity based in the United States. The fraternity is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization incorporated in the state of Pennsylvania, with the purpose of fostering the ideals of scholarship, leadership, and fellowship. Phi Sigma Pi is organized into approximately one hundred and forty collegiate chapters at four-year collegiate institutions and several regionally established alumni chapters and associations serving approximately 50,000 brothers.

Individual Chapters can raise this requirement, for example to a 3.25, but they cannot lower it.
