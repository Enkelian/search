Old and Wise
"Old and Wise" is a 1982 song by the Alan Parsons Project from the album Eye in the Sky. It's lyrics deal with an old person looking back at his life and realizing he could never understand other people. The song reached number 21 on the U.S. Billboard AC chart in early 1983 and number 74 in the United Kingdom; the first of the band's singles to chart in that country. Lead vocal The lead vocal on the original release of "Old and Wise" was performed by former Zombies vocalist Colin Blunstone. Blunstone made several appearances on Alan Parsons Project albums, but "Old and Wise" was the only single with Blunstone as lead singer to gain airplay. Blunstone later re-recorded the song for his own two-disc Best Of album, titled Old and Wise, released in 2003.However an early (demo?) version (without orchestration or the saxophone solo) features Eric Woolfson singing lead. It was included as one of the bonus tracks on the 2007 remastered edition of Eye in the Sky. Cover versions Herman van Veen covered the song on his 1992 album You Take My Breath Away (Herman van Veen sings Pop Classics). Viktoria Tolstoy on her 2006 album Pictures
