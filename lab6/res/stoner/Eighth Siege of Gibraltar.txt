Eighth Siege of Gibraltar
The Eighth Siege of Gibraltar (1462) was a successful effort by soldiers of the Kingdom of Castile to take the fortified town of Gibraltar from the Moors of the Emirate of Granada. Capture of this position, which was weakly defended and was taken with little fighting, was strategically important in the final defeat of the Moors in Spain. Background Gibraltar occupied a strategic position in the Middle Ages, serving as a gateway for armed forces from Morocco to enter the Iberian peninsula. Gibraltar had been a Moorish possession for 748 years, apart from a few short intervals of foreign control. By the early 15th century, the Castilians had conquered much of Granada, but the Moors used Gibraltar as a secure base from which they raided the surrounding country.The largest landowner in the region, Enrique Pérez de Guzmán, 2nd Count de Niebla, died in an ill-planned attack on Gibraltar in 1435. The Moors recovered Count Enrique's body and placed it in a barcina, or wicker basket, that they suspended from the castle wall. The Moors rejected many offers by the Christians to redeem the body. However, by the 1460s the Moorish kingdom was fatally weakened and would not last much longer.
