Jeffrey Hammond
Jeffrey Hammond (born 30 July 1946), sometimes credited as Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond, is an artist, musician, and former bass guitar player for the progressive rock band Jethro Tull.Hammond adopted the name "Hammond-Hammond" as a joke, since both his father's name and mother's maiden name were the same. He also joked in interviews that his mother defiantly chose to keep her maiden name, just like Eleanor Roosevelt. Musician with Jethro Tull One of several band members of Jethro Tull to originate from Blackpool, England, Hammond met the band's leader Ian Anderson in school when he was 17 years old, eventually joining a band with him and future band members John Evan and Barriemore Barlow. After leaving grammar school Hammond opted to study painting rather than continue with music, but was convinced to join Jethro Tull in January 1971. Before joining the band as a performer, he appears to have spent much time with the band in the background. Anderson wrote songs about his friend's idiosyncrasies, of which the best known are "A Song for Jeffrey" (on the album This Was), "Jeffrey Goes to Leicester Square" (Stand Up) and "For Michael Collins, Jeffrey and Me" (Benefit).
