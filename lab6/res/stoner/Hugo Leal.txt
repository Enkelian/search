Hugo Leal
Hugo Miguel Ribeiro Leal (born 21 May 1980) is a Portuguese former footballer. A central midfielder, he was also a reliable set piece taker. He amassed Primeira Liga totals of 148 matches and nine goals over 11 seasons, having started his career with Benfica. He also played professionally, albeit with little impact in the countries' top division, in Spain and France. Club career Born in the Lisbon outskirts of Cascais, Leal started his career with local S.L. Benfica and, not yet 17, made his Primeira Liga debut against S.C. Espinho, in a 2–0 home win on 20 April 1997. He made his breakthrough in the 1998–99 season, playing 27 league games and scoring three goals; in between, he served a loan stint at Benfica's farm team F.C. Alverca, at the time also in the top level. In the summer of 1999, Leal moved abroad to play for Spain's Atlético Madrid. In his first year the club was relegated to the second division, and in his only goal of the campaign he was also sent off, in a 13 May 2000 home draw against Sevilla FC; he stayed for the following season but could not help the Colchoneros win promotion back
