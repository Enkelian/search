Corus Group
Tata Steel Europe Ltd. (formerly Corus Group plc) is a steelmaking company headquartered in London, United Kingdom, with its main operations in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Corus Group was formed through the merger of Koninklijke Hoogovens and British Steel plc in 1999 and was a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. It was acquired by Tata of India in 2007, and renamed Tata Steel Europe in September 2010. At formation Corus operated steelmaking plants (blast furnaces) in Port Talbot, Wales; Scunthorpe and Teesside, England; and IJmuiden, the Netherlands, with additional steelmaking facilities in Rotherham, England (electric arc furnace), as well as downstream steel production of both long and flat steel. Profitability at the business was affected by the aftermath of the Financial crisis of 2007–08 (see Great Recession): the Teesside plant was mothballed and sold in 2009/2010; the long products division including the steelworks at Scunthorpe was sold for a nominal sum to Greybull Capital in April 2016. In September 2017, Tata Steel Ltd reached an agreement to merge its European steel business with the German steel manufacturer ThyssenKrupp to form a joint venture headquartered in Amsterdam. The agreement subsequently failed. History Background – Corus British Steel plc
