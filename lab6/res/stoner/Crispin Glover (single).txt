Crispin Glover (single)
"Crispin Glover" is the second single from Scarling.'s debut album, Sweet Heart Dealer. It was released in the USA on two separate 7" vinyl records on November 7, 2004 on the Sympathy for the Record Industry label. Each record has its own cover art — one a portrait of the song's titular actor, the other a photo of the band — and a unique b-side. The title track on both discs has been remixed from the version of "Crispin Glover" on Sweet Heart Dealer.
