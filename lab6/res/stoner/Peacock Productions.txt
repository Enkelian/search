Peacock Productions
Peacock Productions was a long-form production unit of NBC News. The division, established on July 15, 2007, produces factual programming such as news specials, documentary specials, and reality series. While some of its productions do air on other NBCUniversal outlets (such as the NBC network and MSNBC), it produces programs for competing broadcasters as well, such as the networks of A&E Networks and Discovery among others. Peacock has served as an incubator for new production technologies that have later been adopted by NBC News, such as tapeless recording. History Peacock was established on July 15, 2007 by the merger of NBC News Productions & NBC Media Productions, along with the staff of NBC's newsmagazine Dateline.
