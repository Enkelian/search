MetroLyrics
MetroLyrics is a lyrics-dedicated website, founded in December 2002. The MetroLyrics database contains over 1 million songs performed by over 16,000 artists. History MetroLyrics was the first lyrics-dedicated site to license licensing aggregator Gracenote Inc.'s lyrics catalogue in April 2008. Through this lyrics licensing model, lyrics copyright holders accrue royalty revenue when their work is displayed on MetroLyrics.com, which MetroLyrics recuperates by collecting money from banner advertisements on the site. Royalties are paid on all displayed lyrics and are handled through Gracenote. In January 2013, LyricFind acquired Gracenote's lyrics licensing business, merging it in with their own. MetroLyrics' licensing model is distinct, as many lyrics websites still offer content that is allegedly unlicensed and copyright infringing.MetroLyrics was acquired by CBS Interactive in October 2011.
