Known as the "Godfather of Broadband", the "Father of Fiber Optics", and the "Father of Fiber Optic Communications", Kao was awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics for "groundbreaking achievements concerning the transmission of light in fibers for optical communication".Born in Shanghai, Kao was a permanent resident of Hong Kong and held citizenships in the United Kingdom and the United States.
