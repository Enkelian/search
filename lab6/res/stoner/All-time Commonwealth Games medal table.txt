All-time Commonwealth Games medal table
This page shows the all-time medal table for the Commonwealth Games. The table is updated as of 15 April 2018, the day the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast ended. These rankings sort by the number of gold medals earned by a country. The number of silvers is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze. If, after the above, countries are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically. This follows the system used by the IOC, IAAF and BBC. The source for this data are the tallies listed at the Commonwealth Games Federation's website.
