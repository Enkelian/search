Southern Voice (album)
Southern Voice is the tenth studio album by country music artist Tim McGraw. It is the first album of all new material since Let It Go in 2007. The album produced three singles with "It's a Business Doing Pleasure with You", the title track, and "Still". History McGraw was originally to have released his next album in 2008. To extend the term of the singer's recording contract, Curb Records instead released a third greatest hits package from the artist, only two years after his second greatest hits release â€“ a move which the singer publicly criticized. The release of the album was finally announced on June 30, 2009. The announcement also stated that McGraw would begin an extensive tour in support of the album in early 2010. Singles "It's a Business Doing Pleasure with You", written by Brett James and Nickelback lead vocalist Chad Kroeger, served as the album's lead-off single. It reached a peak of number 13 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. The title-track was released in September 2009, as the second single, and "Still" as the third and final single.
