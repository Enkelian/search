Guitjo (six-string)
Banjo guitar or Banjitar or Ganjo (Australia) is a six-string banjo tuned in the standard tuning of a six-string guitar (E2-A2-D3-G3-B3-E4) from lowest to highest strings. The six-string banjo was introduced in the late 19th century. Less widespread than four- and five-string banjos, it was reintroduced in the latter part of the twentieth century with the modern guitar-like tuning. The six-string "banjo guitar" should not be confused with the five-string Bluegrass banjo (played by Pete Seeger, Earl Scruggs and others), which retains re-entrant banjo tuning with a high-pitched short drone string going halfway up the neck. The zither banjo has six tuning keys, but also only five strings as the short fifth string goes up a hole at the 5th fret up a channel under the fingerboard, and through a hole in the headstock to a tuning roller. A double-necked guitjo is a guitar-like, fretted, stringed, musical instrument that has two necks attached to a single body, generally with 14 strings, seven on each neck. It is strung more like a banjo rather than a traditional guitar. The two necks can be played simultaneously, producing a sound that has elements of both guitar and harp.The double-necked guitjo was developed in
