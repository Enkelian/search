Diodotus II
Diodotus II Theos (Greek: Διόδοτος Θεός; died c. 225 BC) was the son of Diodotus I, who led Bactria to independence from the Seleucid empire, establishing the Greco-Bactrian kingdom. Diodotus II probably ruled alongside his father as co-regent, before succeeding him as sole king around 235 BC. He prevented Seleucid efforts to reincorporate Bactria into their empire, by allying with the Parthians against them. He was killed around 225 BC by the usurper Euthydemus I, who succeeded him as king. Diodotus' career was recounted by Apollodorus of Artemita in the Parthian History, but this text is lost, and surviving literary sources only mention him in passing. Thus, most details of Diodotus' life and career have to be reconstructed from numismatics. Background and co-regency The Seleucid empire gained control of Bactria and the surrounding regions between 308 and 305 BC and made it a satrapy (province) of their empire. Diodotus' father, Diodotus I ruled the region of Bactria as a satrap (governor) some time in the 260s BC and gradually drifted into independence during the reign of the Seleucid king Antiochus II Theos (261-246 BC). The process culminated in Diodotus I's proclamation of himself as king sometime between 255 and 245
