Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814
Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 (commonly referred to as Rhythm Nation) is the fourth studio album by American singer Janet Jackson, released on September 19, 1989, by A&M Records. Although label executives wanted material similar to her previous album, Control (1986), Jackson insisted on creating a concept album addressing social issues. Collaborating with songwriters and record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, she drew inspiration from various tragedies reported through news media, exploring racism, poverty, and substance abuse, in addition to themes of romance. Noted for its use of sample loop and utilizing swing note and synthesized percussion throughout its production, Rhythm Nation encompasses a variety of musical styles, such as new jack swing, hard rock, pop, dance and industrial music. The songs range from mechanized dance rhythms to soft balladry, giving it appeal across multiple radio formats. Although its primary concept was met with mixed reactions, its composition received critical acclaim. Jackson came to be considered a role model for youth because of her socially conscious lyrics. Rhythm Nation 1814 became Jackson's second consecutive album to top the Billboard 200.
