Gas Huffer
Gas Huffer was an American garage rock band from Washington state. They were known for their informal and comical lyrics and their antic stage presence. History Gas Huffer classified themselves loosely in the garage punk genre. The band created comic books with each album (drawn by all four members of the band, including Joe Newton, now deputy art director for Rolling Stone magazine), that contain the lyrics to the songs. This was done for every album up to (and including) "Just Beautiful Music". Gas Huffer played its final show - dubbed "The Last Huffer" - at Seattle's Crocodile Cafe on January 14, 2006. Opening the show were Girl Trouble from Tacoma, Washington, and Canned Hamm [1] from Vancouver, British Columbia. At the conclusion of Girl Trouble's set, K.P. Kendall called Gas Huffer's Tom Price (who has been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease) to the stage and presented to him a "Certificate of Achievement". Prior to Gas Huffer, Tom Price played with The U-Men. Tom Price and Don Blackstone currently play in the Tom Price Desert Classic. Matt Wright was also briefly a member in the band, having appeared in its debut 7". The Tom Price Desert Classic LP "HELL" was released
