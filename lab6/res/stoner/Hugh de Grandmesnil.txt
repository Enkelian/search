Hugh de Grandmesnil
Hugh de Grandmesnil (1032 – 22 February 1098), also known as Hugues or Hugo de Grentmesnil or Grentemesnil, is one of the very few proven companions of William the Conqueror known to have fought at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Subsequently, he became a great landowner in England. He was the elder son of Robert (I) of Grandmesnil and Hawise d'Echaffour, daughter of Giroie, Lord of Échauffour. Robert (II) of Grandmesnil was his younger brother. Following the conquest William I of England gave Hugh 100 manors for his services, sixty-five of them in Leicestershire. He was appointed Sheriff of the county of Leicester and Governor of Hampshire. Hugh's possessions are listed in some detail in the Domesday Book ( p 652-6). Hugh's family The story of the Grandmesnils begins in the mid-11th century in central Normandy, where the family was famous for breeding and training war horses. The De Grandmesnils had made a fortune from a string of stud farms they owned on the plains of Ouche, but during the minority of Duke William, the stability of Normandy began to break down. Old scores were settled as the barons made a grab for each other's territories. Roger de Beaumont
