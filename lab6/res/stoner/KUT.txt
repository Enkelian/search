KUT
KUT, 90.5 FM, is a listener-supported and corporate-sponsored public radio station based in Austin, Texas. KUT is owned and operated by faculty and staff of the University of Texas at Austin. It is the National Public Radio member station for central Texas. Its studio operations are located on campus at the Belo Center for New Media. KUT is one of three radio outlets based on UT campus alongside student-run KVRX 91.7 FM and KUTX 98.9 FM. KUT's main transmitter broadcasts with an effective radiated power of 100,000 watts and is located 8 miles west of Downtown Austin at the University of Texas Bee Cave Research Center. KUT is licensed to broadcast in the digital hybrid HD format. A second station, KUTX, serving San Angelo at 90.1 MHz, was sold to Texas Tech University in 2010 in part because Angelo State University had become part of the Texas Tech University System. The call letters were changed from KUTX to KNCH. The KUTX call letters were moved to KUT's repeater station in Somerville, broadcasting to the Bryan/College Station area on 88.1 FM. On August 23, 2012, the UT System Board of Regents voted to move forward to purchase KXBT-FM 98.9 FM (Leander/Austin)
