Circuit of Wales
Circuit of Wales (Welsh: Cylchffordd Cymru) is a proposed motor racing circuit and technology park development project in Blaenau Gwent on the outskirts of Ebbw Vale, Wales, adjacent to the Neath to Abergavenny Trunk Road (A465). The intention is that it would be funded by private investors and backed by the Welsh Government. In April 2016, BBC News reported that The Heads of the Valleys Development Company, would continue to negotiate with both the financial backers, Aviva, and the Welsh Government.The circuit is being designed to FIA and FIM standards with the aim of hosting events such as the MotoGP, Superbike World Championship, Motocross World Championship, British GT Championship, British Touring Car Championship and the World Touring Car Championship.Ken Skates, AM and Economy Secretary, issued a statement on 29 March 2017 that detailed reports had been requested and the decision concerning £425M public funding would be available by mid-May. In June 2017, a proposed taxpayer-funded guarantee of £210million was rejected by the Welsh Government on the grounds that the financial risk was too great. The original planned opening had been 2016. In September 2018, an application to renew the expired planning consent was submitted to Blaenau Gwent County Borough Council.
