Dubbed the "Father of Disco", Moroder is credited with pioneering Italo disco and electronic dance music, and his work with synthesizers heavily influenced several music genres such as new wave, house and techno music.When in Munich in the 1970s, Moroder started his own record label called Oasis Records, which several years later became a subdivision of Casablanca Records. He is the founder of the former Musicland Studios in Munich, a recording studio used by many artists including The Rolling Stones, Electric Light Orchestra, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Queen and Elton John. He produced singles for Donna Summer during the mid-to-late 1970s disco era, including "Love to Love You Baby", "I Feel Love", "Last Dance", "MacArthur Park", "Hot Stuff", "Bad Girls", "Dim All the Lights", "No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)", and "On the Radio". During this period, he also released many albums, including the synthesizer-driven From Here To Eternity (1977) and E=MC2 (1979), the first album to be entirely digitally recorded.He later began composing film soundtracks and scores, including Midnight Express, American Gigolo, Superman III, Scarface, The NeverEnding Story,
