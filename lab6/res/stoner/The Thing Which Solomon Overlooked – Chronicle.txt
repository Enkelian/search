The Thing Which Solomon Overlooked – Chronicle
目をそらした瞬間 -the thing which solomon overlooked- chronicle is a 4-disc compilation album by the Japanese experimental band Boris. It was released exclusively in Japan on March 20, 2013 through Daymare Recordings, collecting three previously released volumes as well as a newly recorded volume in the same style. This is currently the only way to get any of the volumes on CD. The fourth volume was released separately on vinyl in a cardboard box designed to hold the previously released vinyl volumes. "a bao a qu" is also the title of another, seemingly unrelated track that appears in several different forms: one used for a single and video compilation; another for Sound Track from Film "Mabuta no Ura"; and yet another for Boris / Variations + Live in Japan. "No Ones Grieve Part 2" was reused with additional vocals on Smile.
