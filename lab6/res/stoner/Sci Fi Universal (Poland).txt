Sci Fi Universal (Poland)
See Syfy Universal for a list of other Sci Fi channels.Sci Fi in Poland was launched on December 1, 2007. Today, it is available through satellite and cable television. Unlike NBCUniversal's other science fiction channels around the world, the Polish channel maintained the "Sci Fi" brand on October 14, 2010. The term "syfy" has negative connotations in the Polish language, because it is a plural form of the word 'syf' (dirt, syphilis), which is why they chose to become Sci Fi rather than "Syfy".
