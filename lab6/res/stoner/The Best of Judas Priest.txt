The Best of Judas Priest
The Best of Judas Priest is a compilation album featuring select songs from English heavy metal band Judas Priest's first two albums, Rocka Rolla (1974) and Sad Wings of Destiny (1976). Overview After forming in 1969, Judas Priest signed with Gull Records in 1974. When the band jumped to CBS Records in early 1977, they had to break their contract with Gull to do so. In the legal fallout that ensued, the band forfeited their rights to all material recorded with Gull. The album is not a typical "greatest hits" type of collection as the title would imply. It was the first of a handful of releases featuring material Judas Priest had recorded during their time with Gull, and was produced by the label in an effort to capitalize on the band's growing popularity. As the band had forfeited their legal claim to the music, the album was released without their consent.
