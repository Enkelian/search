Vice Records
Vice Media LLC is an American-based Canadian digital media and broadcasting company. Developing from Vice magazine, originally based in Montreal and co-founded by Suroosh Alvi, Shane Smith, and Gavin McInnes (who left the company in 2008), Vice expanded primarily into youth and young adult–focused digital media. This included online content verticals and related web series, the news division Vice News, a film production studio, and a record label among other properties. In 2015, Vice Media was called "[arguably] a poster child for new-media success—especially when it comes to attracting a valuable millennial audience." Vice re-located to New York City in 2001. Vice Media previously broadcast their news programs on HBO. HBO broadcast the Emmy-winning weekly documentary series Vice, which premiered on the network in April 2013. Vice features segments on global issues hosted by Shane Smith, co-founder Suroosh Alvi, and a rotating cast of correspondents. They also broadcast Vice News Tonight, which premiered October 10, 2016, showcased a nightly roundup of global news, technology, the environment, economics, and pop culture while eschewing traditional news anchors. However, on June 10, 2019, HBO announced the news program's cancellation in addition to the severing of relations with Vice Media after a seven-year partnership.In
