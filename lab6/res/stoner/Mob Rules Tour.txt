Mob Rules Tour
The Mob Rules Tour, by the English rock group Black Sabbath, began on 15 November 1981 in Quebec City and ended on 31 August 1982 in Hoffman Estates, Illinois. Background A cross was used in the stage production."The album is more rockier than we've done before," observed guitarist Tony Iommi, "and the show is far more uptempo that it has been before – and a lot more involved… with stage presentation and effects and stuff like that. We enjoy it, the whole thing – we're very happy with the situation at the moment."Recordings from the tour spawned the Live Evil album.
