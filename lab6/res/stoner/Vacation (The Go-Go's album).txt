Vacation (The Go-Go's album)
Vacation is the second studio album by American rock band the Go-Go's, released in 1982 on the I.R.S. Records label. The album reached No. 8 in the Billboard 200, and was certified Gold. The title track was a U.S. summer smash, reaching No. 8 on the Billboard pop singles chart. The Go-Go's were riding high at the time of the album's first release, their prospects to all outward appearances looking bright. Future problems were beginning to take shape, as the members' drug use and internal fighting began to escalate. The single "Vacation" was also issued as perhaps the first cassette single ever. In addition to the title track, two more singles were pulled from the album at the time: "Get Up and Go" and "This Old Feeling", the former of which was a minor hit (Hot 100 No. 50) in the United States. The song "Speeding", which is not on the album, is a Caffey/Wiedlin composition used as B-side of the single for "Get Up and Go". It also appeared in the film Fast Times at Ridgemont High, as well as on the film's soundtrack. Track listing Personnel The Go-Go's Belinda Carlisle – lead vocals Charlotte Caffey – lead guitar,
