Calvin, Don't Jump!
Calvin, Don't Jump! started as the solo recording project of J. Kirk Pleasant, a musician with extensive connections to the Elephant 6 Collective. Before moving to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, he contributed to releases from bands like the Olivia Tremor Control, Black Swan Network, and Pipes You See, Pipes You Don't. His own albums have featured contributions from musicians like Scott Spillane (Neutral Milk Hotel, The Gerbils), Jeremy Barnes (Neutral Milk Hotel, A Hawk And A Hacksaw), John D'Azzo (The Gerbils), as well as Peter Erchick, Eric Harris, and John Fernandes (all of the Olivia Tremor Control). To date Pleasant has released four full-length albums under this name, as well as four 7" singles, a cd-r of live recordings, and a cassette EP titled Notes From Undersound. His album Conscious of Conscience (2006) marks his first true solo full-length, drawing on assistance from no outside collaborators. Early in 2007, Pleasant announced that what had begun as a solo project would expand into a four-piece band, geared towards a poppier, more guitar driven sound. The band now features Pleasant (vocals and guitar), Nathan Matthews (bass), Lee-Ann Sheel (drums), and Shinobu Hata (keyboards).
