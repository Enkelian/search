Loudest Love
Loudest Love is an EP by the American rock band Soundgarden. It was released in October 1990 through A&M Records. Overview The EP was first released in Japan, and later released in the United States. The track listing is the same as that for the "Loud Love" single, but with the addition of "Hands All Over", "Heretic" and "Come Together". AllMusic staff writer Greg Prato said, "The Loudest Love compilation is quite a find for hardcore fans of Soundgarden, but if you're a newcomer, start off with their 1997 best-of collection, A-Sides, or one of their official albums." Track listing All lyrics are written by Chris Cornell, except where noted.Tracks 1-3 are taken directly from the album Louder Than Love and are identical to their album counterparts. Track 7 is a remix of the album version of the song by Steve Fisk, also available on the "Loud Love" single. Tracks 4 and 6 are b-sides from the "Hands All Over" and "Loud Love" singles, respectively. Track 5 is a cover of the classic Beatles tune, and is the only Soundgarden song to feature bassist, and Nirvana guitarist, Jason Everman.
