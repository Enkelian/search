Bloodlust (Body Count album)
Bloodlust is the sixth studio album by American heavy metal band Body Count, released March 31, 2017 by Century Media Records. The opening track "Here I Go Again" is a re-recording of a demo track from vocalist Ice-T's Return of the Real sessions. In its first week, it debuted at #3 in the UK Rock and Metal Chart. The track "Black Hoodie" was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards. The second track, "No Lives Matter", addresses the role of race in social inequality. The third track, "All Love Is Lost," is about husbands who are having an affair with their mistresses behind their wives' backs and features Max Cavalera on guitar and vocals. The video features actress Kelli Giddish (Ice-T's co-star on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit) playing the role of the vindictive wife who kills her husband because he's cheating on her. The album contains a cover of Raining Blood from Slayer; the title was changed to "Raining In Blood" for publishing reasons.
