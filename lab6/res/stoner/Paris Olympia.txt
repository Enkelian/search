Paris Olympia
The Olympia (French: [olɛ̃mpja]; commonly known as L'Olympia or in the English-speaking world as Olympia Hall) is a concert venue in the 9th arrondissement of Paris, France, located at 28 Boulevard des Capucines, equally distancing Madeleine church and Opéra Garnier, 300 metres (980 ft) north of Vendôme square. Its closest métro/RER stations are Madeleine, Opéra, Havre – Caumartin and Auber. The hall was opened in 1888 by the co-creators of the Moulin Rouge venue, and saw many opera, ballet and music hall performances. Theatrical performances declined in the early 20th century and the Olympia was converted into a cinema, before re-opening as a venue in 1954. Since the 1960s, it has been a popular venue for rock bands. The Olympia was nearly demolished in the early 1990s, but saved by a preservation order and extensive reconstruction, and remains a popular venue.
