Magic Tour (Queen)
The Magic Tour was Queen's final tour with their lead singer Freddie Mercury and their bass guitarist John Deacon, with 26 concert dates in Europe in 1986. The band did not tour again until 19 years later, when the Queen + Paul Rodgers Tour began in 2005, after the death of Mercury on 24 November 1991, and the retirement of Deacon in 1997. The Magic Tour supported the band's album A Kind of Magic. In 1987, Mercury was diagnosed as having AIDS and the band together made the decision to stop touring, making the concert at Knebworth on 9 August 1986 the last time that the four original members of Queen performed on stage together. The Knebworth concert is regarded as the pinnacle of the tour, and is often represented in photography by a frantic swarm of helicopters branded under the 'magic' emblem. Over a million people attended the Queen tour, making it one of the largest ever. Support acts included The Alarm, The Bangles, Big Country, Belouis Some, INXS, Level 42, Marillion, Gary Moore, Status Quo, and Zeno.From this tour, Queen have since released Live at Wembley on VHS, Laserdisc, CD and DVD, Live Magic on CD and Live
