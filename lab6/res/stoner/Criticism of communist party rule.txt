Criticism of communist party rule
The actions by governments of communist states have been subject to criticism. According to critics, the rule by communist parties leads to totalitarianism, political repression, restrictions of human rights, poor economic performance and cultural and artistic censorship. Western criticism of communist rule is also been grounded in criticism of socialism by economists such as Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman, who argued that the state ownership and planned economy characteristic of Soviet-style communist rule were responsible for economic stagnation and shortage economies, providing few incentives for individuals to improve productivity and engage in entrepreneurship. Ruling communist parties have also been challenged by domestic dissent.In Eastern Europe, the works of dissidents Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and VÃ¡clav Havel gained international prominence as did the works of disillusioned ex-communists such as Milovan Djilas, who condemned the new class or nomenklatura system that had emerged under communist rule. Communism: Promise and Practice (1973) detailed what its author termed flagrant gaps between official Soviet policies of equality and economic justice and the reality of the emergence of a new class in the Soviet Union and in other communist countries, which thrived at the expense of the remaining population. Major criticism has also come from the anti-Stalinist left
