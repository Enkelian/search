St. George Cricket Grounds
St. George Cricket Grounds or St. George Grounds is a former baseball venue located on Staten Island, New York. St. George was the home park for the New York Metropolitans of the American Association for the 1886 and 1887 seasons. The grounds were also a part-time home to the New York Giants of the National League in 1889. The stadium, which was built along the lines of a typical horse race track grandstand, was constructed as part of the development of the then-new community of St. George, Staten Island in 1886, by Erastus Wiman. Although the community and the ferry were successful, baseball was not. The Giants were a strong team through the latter part of the 1880s, and the Metropolitans folded after the 1887 season. The Giants played some games there from April 29 â€“ June 14, 1889, while awaiting construction of the Polo Grounds; their move to Manhattan ended professional baseball at St. George.
