2000 San Diego Chargers season
The 2000 San Diego Chargers season was the franchise’s 31st season in the National Football League (NFL) and the 41st overall and the second under head coach Mike Riley. The Chargers failed to improve on their 8–8 record from 1999, and finished the season 1–15, the worst record of any Chargers team in history. The team lost its first eleven games before their only victory of the season against the Kansas City Chiefs (by one point, which was obtained on a last-second field goal). The Carolina Panthers would match this embarrassment the next year. The 2000 Chargers were also the first team to finish 1–15 and have their only win of the season be at home. Oddly enough, out of the ten teams in NFL history to finish 1–15, only two others had their only win at home (2007 Dolphins and 2016 Browns) San Diego had a historically inept running attack in 2000; their 1,062 total team rushing yards (66.4 per game) is the lowest total of rushing yards by any team in NFL history in a 16-game season. For perspective, the strike-shortened 1982 NFL season—which was a nine-game schedule—included thirteen teams who rushed for more yards than San Diego
