Campbell Hall (UC Berkeley)
Campbell Hall is an academic building at the University of California, Berkeley. Housing the astronomy department at UC Berkeley, it is linked by a bridge to the physics department in LeConte Hall. It is named after astronomer and former UC President William Wallace Campbell. History The first Campbell Hall was built from 1957 to 1959 as one of several buildings built in the post World War II era. Its design is a combination of modernist design that was encouraged by a 1951 Campus Plan Study performed by the Office of Architects and Engineers, and the Beaux Arts/neo-classical design of earlier buildings. Campbell Hall was constructed to house the departments of astronomy, statistics, and mathematics, and the campus computer center. The Department of Astronomy has remained in the building since its completion, but the other programs mostly relocated to nearby buildings. Two small observatory domes were incorporated into Campbell Hall, but it was soon decided that it was not a useful location for astronomical observation because of weather and increasing urban light pollution. Recently, it mainly housed the astronomy and astrophysics programs, and various administrative offices for the College of Letters and Sciences, including the dean's office.The old building was rated
