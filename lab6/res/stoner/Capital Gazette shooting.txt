On June 28, 2018, a mass shooting occurred at the offices of The Capital, a newspaper serving Annapolis, Maryland. The gunman, Jarrod Ramos, shot and killed five employees with a shotgun; two others were injured while trying to escape. Ramos was arrested shortly thereafter. He has pleaded guilty to 23 charges and is currently imprisoned while awaiting trial for the shooting.The newspaper published an article in 2011 about Ramos's being put on probation for harassing an acquaintance from high school through social media and email.
