Johannes Urzidil
Johannes Urzidil (February 3, 1896 â€“ November 2, 1970) was a writer, poet, historian, born in Prague, he died in Rome. His father was a German Bohemian and his mother was Jewish. Urzidil was educated in Prague, studying German, art history, and Slavic languages before turning to journalism and writing. His initial efforts in poetry were influenced by Expressionism, and were published under the pseudonym Hans Elmar. He also worked as a writer and editor of the monthly journal Der Mensch. Among his acquaintances during this period were Franz Werfel, Ludwig Winder and Franz Kafka. From 1922 until 1933 he advised the press section of the German embassy in Prague. When Czechoslovakia was occupied by Nazi Germany in 1939, he was dismissed from employment by the German embassy because of his being "Halbjude" ("half-Jewish", a Nazi designation) and this situation caused Urzidil to emigrate to Great Britain. There he was financially supported by the British writer Bryher. In 1941 he and his wife, the poet Gertrude Urzidil, came to the United States, acquiring American citizenship in 1946. Although he published poetry, Urzidil is best known for his prose which, though written in exile, reflects his Bohemian heritage just as well
