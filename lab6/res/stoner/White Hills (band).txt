White Hills (band)
White Hills is an American psychedelic rock band that was formed in 2003 in New York City. Founding members Dave W. (guitar & vocals) and Ego Sensation (bass & vocals) have been the only constant members. They are known for being one of the most prolific bands of their generation, recording over 40 separate releases including 7 full-length studio albums. Their music strikes “a riveting balance between heaviness and ethereality” combining elements of krautrock, post-punk, art rock, goth, psychedelic rock, metal, stoner rock, ambient and experimental music. They are often compared to Iggy Pop and the Stooges, Pink Floyd, Hawkwind, MC5 and Spiritualized. Biography The band is currently signed to Thrill Jockey Records whose artist roster also includes Future Islands, Wooden Shjips, Tortoise, The Sea and Cake, Matmos, Liturgy and Trans Am. The band's first album, No Game To Play, was a solo recording project by Dave W released in 2005. Julian Cope issued a limited remix of the album as They’ve Got Blood Like We’ve Got Blood on his Fuck Off and Di label. The band's next album Glitter Glamour Atrocity (self-released) garnered the attention of Stewart Lee from the Sunday London Times creating sudden visibility for the group.
