Lucius
Lucius (Greek: Λούκιος Loukios; Etruscan: Luvcie) is a male given name derived from Lucius (abbreviated L.), one of the small group of common Latin forenames (praenomina) found in the culture of ancient Rome. Lucius derives from Latin word Lux (gen. lucis), meaning "light" (<PIE *leuk- "brightness", Latin verb lucere "to shine"), and is a cognate of the name Lucas. Another etymology proposed is a derivation from Etruscan Lauchum (or Lauchme) meaning "king", which however was transferred into Latin as Lucumo.In addition, Lucius is an English masculine given name and an Austrian, German, Luxembourgish and Dutch surname. Lucius has been translated into Italian, Spanish and Portuguese, as Lucio. Derived from the related patronymic Lucianus is Luciano in Italian, Spanish and Portuguese and Lucien in French.
