Spine of God
Spine of God is the debut studio album by American rock band Monster Magnet, released in 1991 in Europe and in the United States in the following year. The album represents one of the earliest examples of the emerging 1990s sub-genre of stoner rock. Though it did not perform well commercially at the time of its release, the album appeared in the number nine position on Spin Magazine's "Ten Best Albums of the Year You Didn't Hear" for the year 1991. The song "Medicine" was released as a single with accompanying music video. Overview The album mixes elements of punk, heavy metal, psychedelic rock, and space rock. The album features a cover of Grand Funk Railroad's "Sin's a Good Man's Brother". Spin magazine, in its December 1991 issue, referred to the album as "a total KO" while comparing it favorable to the work of grunge rock icons of the day such as Soundgarden, Tad, and Mudhoney.Spine of God was re-released in March 2006 on Steamhammer Records with new artwork, new liner notes, compressed dynamic range, and a previously unreleased demo version of "Ozium" included as a bonus track.
