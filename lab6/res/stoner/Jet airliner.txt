Jet airliner
A jet airliner or jetliner is an airliner powered by jet engines (passenger jet aircraft). Airliners usually have two or four jet engines; three-engined designs were popular in the 1970s but are less common today. Airliners are commonly classified as either the generally long-haul wide-body aircraft or narrow-body aircraft. Most airliners today are powered by jet engines, because they are capable of safely operating at high speeds and generate sufficient thrust to power large-capacity aircraft. The first jetliners, introduced in the 1950s, used the simpler turbojet engine; these were quickly supplanted by designs using turbofans, which are quieter and more fuel-efficient. A general "classic" airliner design is generally a single-fuselage design with low-mounted, swept-back wings, usually with two jet engines mounted either underneath the wings or on the tail assembly, with vertical stabilisers generally being on the empennage of the aircraft for wing-mounted engines, or with vertical stabilisers being attached to the top of the horizontal stabiliser (T-tail design) in the case of an aircraft with engines mounted on the empennage. Early history The first airliners with turbojet propulsion were experimental conversions of the Avro Lancastrian piston-engined airliner, which were flown with several types of early jet engine, including the
