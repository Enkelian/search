Circle of Willis
The circle of Willis (also called Willis' circle, loop of Willis, cerebral arterial circle, and Willis polygon) is a circulatory anastomosis that supplies blood to the brain and surrounding structures. It is named after Thomas Willis (1621â€“1675), an English physician. Structure The circle of Willis is a part of the cerebral circulation and is composed of the following arteries: Anterior cerebral artery (left and right) Anterior communicating artery Internal carotid artery (left and right) Posterior cerebral artery (left and right) Posterior communicating artery (left and right)The middle cerebral arteries, supplying the brain, are not considered part of the circle. Origin of arteries The left and right internal carotid arteries arise from the left and right common carotid arteries. The posterior communicating artery is given off as a branch of the internal carotid artery just before it divides into its terminal branches - the anterior and middle cerebral arteries. The anterior cerebral artery forms the anterolateral portion of the circle of Willis, while the middle cerebral artery does not contribute to the circle. The right and left posterior cerebral arteries arise from the basilar artery, which is formed by the left and right vertebral arteries. The vertebral arteries arise from the
