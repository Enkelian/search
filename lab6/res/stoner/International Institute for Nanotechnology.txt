International Institute for Nanotechnology
The International Institute for Nanotechnology (IIN) was established by Northwestern University in 2000. It was the first institute of its kind in the United States and is one of the premier nanoscience research centers in the world. Today, the IIN represents and unites more than $1 billion in nanotechnology research, educational programs, and supporting infrastructure.IIN faculty includes 20 members of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the Institute of Medicine. One of Northwestern University's largest collaborative efforts, IIN brings together more than 240 chemists, engineers, biologists, physicians, and business experts, to focus on society's most perplexing problems. But the IIN's influence extends far beyond Northwestern's campus. It has developed collaborative partnerships with academic institutions in 30 countries, as well as with more than a dozen U.S. federal agencies and 100 countries. Since its inception, more than 2,000 products and systems have been commercialized worldwide. Twenty-three start-up companies have been launched based upon IIN research, and they have attracted over $1 billion in venture capital funding. The IIN is changing the face of research in fields from medical diagnostics to materials science. The IIN drives innovation-based business formation, employment and economic growth.The IIN embodies an extraordinary
