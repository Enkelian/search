Dublin University Rifle Club
Dublin University Rifle Club (DURC) is the rifle club of the University of Dublin, Trinity College, located in Dublin, Ireland. The club competes in a number of Olympic shooting disciplines including air rifle and small bore. It is the Universities third oldest sports club, and its members include students, alumni and staff from Trinity College. Early history While there are records of competitive shooting in Trinity College (beyond that of duelling) going back as far as 1840, the club in its present session was founded in January 1962 by P.G.L. Coulson (who went on to become its first Captain), M.C.C. Heaton (first Secretary) and C.R. Oakley (first Treasurer). In its first year the club had over 50 members yet no range and virtually no equipment. The first record of anyone shooting was as part of a team sent to Bisley in July 1962 competing in fullbore events. The first Chief Range Officer (C.R.O.) was appointed in 1964, the post was held by M.C.C. Heaton, and with that the first Range was established and approved by the College Board for the Lincoln gate end of College in May 1964 and by October of that year the C.R.O. reported it operational.
