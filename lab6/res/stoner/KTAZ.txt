KTAZ
KTAZ, virtual channel 39 (UHF digital channel 29), is a Telemundo owned-and-operated television station licensed to Phoenix, Arizona, United States. The station is owned by the Telemundo Station Group subsidiary of NBCUniversal (itself a subsidiary of Comcast). KTAZ's studios are located on South 33rd Place in Phoenix, and its transmitter is located atop South Mountain on the city's south side. KHRR (channel 40) in Tucson operates as a semi-satellite of KTAZ, extending the Telemundo signal into Southern Arizona. As such, it simulcasts all Telemundo programming as provided through KTAZ but airs separate commercial inserts and legal identifications, and has its own website. Local newscasts, produced by KTAZ and branded as Noticiero Telemundo Arizona, are simulcast on both stations. Although KHRR maintains its own studios on North Stone Avenue in downtown Tucson, master control and most internal operations are based at KTAZ's facilities. History In 1986, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) designated VHF channel 11 as a commercial allotment for Holbrook. The allotment lay vacant until April 1996, when Channel 11 LLC applied for a permit to build a TV station. The application was granted on January 23, 1998, and in March, Channel 11 requested KBCZ for its call sign., In
