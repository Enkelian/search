Xenon dichloride
Xenon dichloride (XeCl2) is a xenon compound and the only known stable chloride of xenon. The compound can be prepared by using microwave discharges towards the mixture of xenon and chlorine, and it can be isolated from a condensate trap. One experiment tried to use xenon, chlorine and boron trichloride to produce XeCl2Â·BCl3, but only generated xenon dichloride.However, it is still doubtful whether xenon dichloride is a true compound or a supermolecule composed of a xenon atom and a chlorine molecule connected by a secondary bond.Xenon monochloride is used in excimer lasers. Xe2Cl also exists in the excimer state. == References ==
