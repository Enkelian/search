In These Black Days
In These Black Days: A Tribute to Black Sabbath is the name of a 6-volume Black Sabbath tribute series, released as a series of split 7" singles by Hydra Head Records. A double CD edition, compiling of all of the songs from the 7"s, as well as additional Black Sabbath covers from other bands associated with Hydra Head Records, was planned for years, but has not been released. One track recorded for inclusion on the eventual CD release, Isis's cover of "Hand of Doom", was instead included on the band's Sawblade EP.
