Maryland Route 193
Maryland Route 193 (MD 193) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland. Known for most of its length as University Boulevard and Greenbelt Road, the state highway runs 26.07 mi (41.96 km) from MD 185 in Kensington east to MD 202 north of Upper Marlboro. MD 193 serves as a major east-west commuter route in eastern Montgomery County and northern Prince George's County, connecting Wheaton, Silver Spring, Langley Park, College Park, and Greenbelt. The state highway also provides the primary access to the University of Maryland and Goddard Space Flight Center. In central Prince George's County, MD 193 is the main north-south highway connecting Glenn Dale and Greater Upper Marlboro with the affluent suburbs of Woodmore and Kettering. MD 193 originally consisted of Connecticut Avenue between Chevy Chase and Kensington and Old Bladensburg Road (now University Boulevard) between Kensington and College Park. While MD 185 replaced MD 193 on the Connecticut Avenue portion in the 1970s, MD 193 grew on its eastern end by taking over the routing of MD 430 between College Park and Greenbelt and MD 199 in Glenn Dale in the early 1960s. MD 193 reached its final extent by taking over MD 556
