The Pit (arena)
The Pit, formally named Dreamstyle Arena, is an indoor arena in Albuquerque, New Mexico, serving primarily as the home venue of the University of New Mexico Lobo basketball teams. The facility opened in 1966 as University Arena but gained the nickname "The Pit" due to its innovative subterranean design, with its playing floor 37 feet (11 m) below street level. The arena is located on the UNM South Campus and has a seating capacity of 15,411 for basketball and up to 13,480 for concerts, with 40 luxury suites and 365 club seats. The Pit is widely recognized as one of the top college basketball venues in the U.S., and as one of the loudest. The New Mexico Lobos have enjoyed tremendous success at The Pit, winning over 80% of their games there, and attendance has consistently been among the best in college basketball. Renovations completed in 2010 added more space and state-of-the-art amenities for fans, coaches and players. The Pit has frequently hosted NCAA basketball tournament games, including the 1983 Final Four, which featured one of the most famous games in college basketball history where North Carolina State upset Houston.
