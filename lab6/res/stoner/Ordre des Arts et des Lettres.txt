Ordre des Arts et des Lettres
The Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (Order of Arts and Letters) is an Order of France established on 2 May 1957 by the Minister of Culture. Its supplementary status to the Ordre national du Mérite was confirmed by President Charles de Gaulle in 1963. Its purpose is the recognition of significant contributions to the arts, literature, or the propagation of these fields. Its origin is attributed to the Order of Saint-Michel (established 1 August 1469) as acknowledged by French government sources. Background French government guidelines stipulate that citizens of France must be at least thirty years old, respect French civil law, and must have, "significantly contributed to the enrichment of the French cultural inheritance" to be considered for award. Membership is not, however, limited to French nationals; recipients include numerous foreign luminaries. Foreign recipients are admitted into the Order, "without condition of age". The Order has three grades: Commandeur (Commander) — medallion worn on necklet, up to 20 recipients a year Officier (Officer) — medallion worn on ribbon with rosette on left breast, up to 60 recipients a year Chevalier (Knight) — medallion worn on ribbon on left breast, up to 200 recipients a yearThe médaille of the Order
