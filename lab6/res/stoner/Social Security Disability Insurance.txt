Social Security Disability Insurance
Social Security Disability Insurance (SSD or SSDI) is a payroll tax-funded federal insurance program of the United States government. It is managed by the Social Security Administration and designed to provide income supplements to people who are physically restricted in their ability to be employed because of a notable disability (usually physical). SSD can be supplied on either a temporary or permanent basis, usually directly correlated to whether the person's disability is temporary or permanent. People frequently confuse Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Unlike SSI, SSDI does not depend on the income of the disabled individual receiving it. A legitimately disabled person (a finding based on legal and medical justification) of any income level can receive SSD. ('Disability' under SSDI is measured by a different standard than under the Americans with Disabilities Act.) Most SSI recipients are below an administratively mandated income threshold, and these individuals must stay below that threshold to continue receiving SSI, unlike with SSD. Informal names for SSDI include Disability Insurance Benefits (DIB) and Title II benefits. These names come from the chapter title of the governing section of the Social Security Act, which came into law in August 1935. In
