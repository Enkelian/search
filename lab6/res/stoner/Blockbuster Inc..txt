Blockbuster Inc.
Blockbuster LLC (formerly Blockbuster Entertainment, Inc., and also known as Blockbuster Video or simply Blockbuster) was an American-based provider of home movie and video game rental services through a video rental shop, DVD-by-mail, streaming, video on demand, and cinema theater. Blockbuster expanded internationally throughout the 1990s. At its peak in November 2004, Blockbuster employed 84,300 people worldwide, including about 58,500 in the United States and about 25,800 in other countries, and had 9,094 stores in total, with more than 4,500 of these in the US.Competition from the Netflix mail-order service, Redbox automated kiosks, and video on demand services, as well as poor leadership, were major factors leading up to Blockbuster's eventual demise. Blockbuster began to lose significant revenue during the 2000s, and the company filed for bankruptcy protection in 2010. The following year, its remaining 1,700 stores were bought by satellite television provider Dish Network. By early 2014, the last 300 company-owned stores were closed.As of 2020, the Blockbuster brand has mostly been retired. Dish still maintained a small number of Blockbuster store franchise and brand licensing agreements, which allowed some of the remaining privately owned franchised stores to remain open in the US and worldwide between 2014 and 2018.
