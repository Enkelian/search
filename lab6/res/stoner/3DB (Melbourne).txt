3DB (Melbourne)
3DB was a Melbourne-based radio station that opened in 1927, changed its name to 3TT in 1988, and now operates on the FM band as KIIS 101.1. 3DB was one of Melbourne's most popular radio stations, topping the ratings for many decades. Broadcast frequency Upon opening in 1927, 3DB broadcast on the AM band at a wavelength of 254 metres, corresponding to a frequency of 1180 kHz. When seven new broadcasting licences were issued in 1935, including 3XY in Melbourne, most Melbourne stations were allocated new broadcast frequencies; 3DB was allocated 1030 kHz. Until 1978 there was a 10 kHz gap between radio stations. However, the Geneva Frequency Plan of 1975 changed this to a 9 kHz gap, thus allowing more stations on the AM band. Therefore, on 23 November 1978, most Australian stations changed their frequencies and 3DB went to 1026 kHz. History On air times 3DB was awarded its broadcast licence in 1925 but did not immediately come on air due to debates in Federal Parliament as to whether or not Australia should proceed with the then-unique system of A Class (later ABC) and B Class (later commercial) stations. The station eventually made its on-air debut on 27
