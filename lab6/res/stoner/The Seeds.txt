The Seeds
The Seeds were an American rock band formed in Los Angeles, California in 1965. The group became known for psychedelic rock music and is considered a prototype for garage punk rock bands. History The Seeds were formed in 1965 when lead singer Sky Saxon responded to an advertisement.

The band secured regular gigs at the LA club Bido Lito's and quickly gained a local reputation for high energy live performances.Keyboardist Daryl Hooper was a major factor in the Seeds' sound; the band was one of the first to utilize keyboard bass.
