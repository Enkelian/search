Battle of Sultanabad
The Battle of Sultanabad occurred on February 13, 1812, between the Russian Empire and Persian Empire. In the resulting battle, the Russians were routed. The Persians, numerically superior, were led by Abbas Mirza and fought the Russians led by Pyotr Kotlyarevsky. A Persian offensive into Georgia, with their British and French trained Nezam-e Jadid infantry, initiated the battle. The Persians had also obtained European cannons from the French.The Persians won the battle by moving faster than the Russians and attacking them near their camp. Although this was a minor victory for the Persians, Abbas Mirza tried to show it as a major victory.In the end however the Persians lost the invasion due to the Russian maneuvering around the Aras River which culminated in the Battle of Aslanduz. The Persians would have given up had it not been for the news of Napoleon's invasion of Russia in the spring. References Bibliography Roxane Farmanfarmiaian (editor).
