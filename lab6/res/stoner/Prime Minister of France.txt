Prime Minister of France
The prime minister of the French Republic (French: Premier ministre français) in the Fifth Republic is the head of government. During the Third and Fourth Republics, the head of government was formally called President of the Council of Ministers (French: Président du Conseil des Ministres), generally shortened to President of the Council (French: Président du Conseil). Most non-French sources referred to the post as "prime minister" or "premier." The title "prime minister" became official with the founding of the Fifth Republic. The post is subject to no term limits. The prime minister proposes a list of ministers to the president of the Republic. Decrees and decisions of the prime minister, like almost all executive decisions, are subject to the oversight of the administrative court system. Few decrees are taken after advice from the Council of State (French: Conseil d'État). All prime ministers defend the programs of their ministry, and make budgetary choices. The extent to which those decisions lie with the prime minister or president depends upon whether they are of the same party. Manuel Valls was appointed to lead the government in a cabinet reshuffle in March 2014, after the ruling Socialists suffered a bruising defeat in local elections.
