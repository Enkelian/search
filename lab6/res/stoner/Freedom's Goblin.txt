At seventy-five minutes, the album is Segall's longest to date, exceeding 2014's Manipulator. Writing and composition Regarding the album's varied aesthetic, Segall noted, "I'd say that the theme is the anti-theme, and the idea is to be free, hence the name Freedom's Goblin. I have made a lot of records that have had specific restrictions and confinements in the concept, but for this record the idea was that no idea is inappropriate, no space where we're going to record or create is wrong. The more far out, and the more free we get, the better things are." Reception The album received widespread positive reviews, with a score of 84 on Metacritic, indicating "universal acclaim".
