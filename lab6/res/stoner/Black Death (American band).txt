Black Death (American band)
Black Death are an American band who have been noted as the "first all-African-American heavy metal band". The group were also mentioned in Ian Christe's book Sound of the Beast: The Complete Headbanging History of Heavy Metal, and mentioned in "Rock 'n' Roll and the Cleveland Connection" by Deanna R. Adams as "one of the only, if not the only, all-black metal bands in the country" in 1987. History Lineup, Name, and Status Black Death was formed in 1977 by guitarist Greg Hicks, drummer Phil Bullard, and bassist Clayborn Pinkins as an unnamed group. They persisted for a year without a vocalist until Siki Spacek joined; Spacek would also fulfill roles as a guitarist for the band alongside Hicks. The band would not have an official name until nearly two years after its creation; Hicks and Pinkins eventually decided on "Black Death." Shortly thereafter, Pinkins was shot and killed. The resulting lineup changes consisted of two new bassists, the latter of which, Darell Harris, would be added as Pinkins' permanent replacement sometime before 1984.At the end of the band's first major hiatus, which lasted from 1988 to 2009, the lineup took another significant turn when the band was officially re-formed
