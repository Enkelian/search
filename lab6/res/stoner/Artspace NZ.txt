Artspace NZ
Artspace NZ (more commonly styled as ARTSPACE) is an art gallery in Auckland, New Zealand. It is located on Karangahape Road in Newton. The gallery was founded in 1987, and focuses on contemporary New Zealand and overseas art. It is run by a charitable trust by a board of trustees. The trustees appoint a director for the gallery who has a tenure lasting up to three years, during which time they select the exhibition programme. The frequent change of directors by this system allows for a fresh approach to be taken to the gallery's programme on a regular basis. As of 2019, the director is Remco de Blaaij.As a trust-run gallery, ARTSPACE is able to commission conceptual work by emerging artists whose portfolios are not yet developed enough to command space is major public galleries. Despite this, their exhibitions include works by many major and upcoming New Zealand artists. The gallery includes a public reading room available for research, and runs and promotes numerous education programmes.For several years during the early 2000s, the gallery also hosted an annual festival of experimental music, "ARTSPACE/alt.music".Artists who have exhibited at ARTSPACE include: Billy Apple (1997, 2004, and 2015) Yuki Kihara (2017) Justine Kurland
