Hair Nation
Hair Nation is a 1980s glam metal radio station on Sirius Satellite Radio channel 39 (previously 23), XM Satellite Radio channel 39 (previously 41, where it replaced Big Tracks on November 12, 2008), and Dish Network channel 6039. Until February 9, 2010, it was on Direct TV channel 829. The station ID is distinguished with the sound of a hairspray can.
