1982 Los Angeles Rams season
The 1982 Los Angeles Rams season was the team's 45th year with the National Football League and the 37th season in Los Angeles. The season saw the Rams attempting to improve on their 6-10 record from 1981, a season that saw them miss the playoffs for the first time since 1972. However, a players strike wiped out 7 of the team's 16 games, and shortened the season schedule to only 9 games. The team struggled early, starting 0-3 by the time the strike started. After the conclusion of the strike, the Rams finally got a win at home over the Kansas City Chiefs. However, during the game, quarterback Bert Jones was lost for the season after suffering a neck injury that ultimately led to his retirement. The Rams would lose their next four games before upsetting the 49ers in San Francisco in the season finale. The Rams would ultimately finish the season 2-7, last place in their division and dead last in the NFC. It was the team's worst season since 1962, when they won only 1 game. As a result, head coach Ray Malavasi was fired after the season and replaced by John Robinson the next season. Offseason NFL
