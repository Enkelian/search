Chrome (Debbie Harry song)
"Chrome" is a song by the American vocalist Debbie Harry, featured on her debut album KooKoo in 1981. The song was issued as an advance 12" promo in the United States with the album track "Under Arrest" as the B-side but it never had a commercial release. A 7" single was, however, released in Germany, (the B-side was "The Jam Was Moving", which was an A-side in the United Kingdom and the United States), though this failed to chart.
