Corporate America (album)
Corporate America is the fifth studio album by American hard rock band Boston, released in 2002. Most editions feature a live version of "Livin' for You". The original version of "Livin' for You" is from Boston's previous full-length album Walk On (1994). The album also introduced both Anton Cosmo and Kimberley Dahme as both band members and songwriters. This is also the last Boston album to feature lead vocalist and founding member Brad Delp during his lifetime before his death in 2007. It also marked the final appearance of Fran Cosmo. The album sold 32,000 copies in its first week of release and charted at 42 on the Billboard 200. By 2013, the album had sold over 500,000 copies in the United States. The album was pulled from all digital and retail markets by founding member Tom Scholz due to a record company dispute with Artemis.
