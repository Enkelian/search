Herndon Stadium
Alonzo Herndon Stadium, named for Alonzo Herndon, is a 15,011-seat stadium on the campus of Morris Brown College in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. It is the only two-sided stadium in the Atlanta University Center. It is one block over from the locally known Herndon Home, and sits above the MARTA East-West rail line. During the 1996 Summer Olympics, Herndon Stadium hosted field hockey. It was also used as the stand-in for the demolished Fairfield Stadium in Huntington, West Virginia during filming of the 2006 movie We Are Marshall.The stadium was the home to the former Georgia Mustangs and the former Atlanta Beat women's soccer club of the WUSA league. Due to the college's financial hardships, the stadium has been abandoned and fell into a state of disrepair, gutted by vandals and covered in graffiti and trash.
