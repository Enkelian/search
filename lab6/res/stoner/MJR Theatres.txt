MJR Theatres
MJR Digital Cinemas (formerly MJR Theatres) is a movie theater chain headquartered in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. MJR Digital Cinemas serves the Metro Detroit area. Currently, MJR owns and operates ten movie theaters with 164 screens under the MJR banner. History MJR Theatres began in 1980 with the acquisition of the then-Main Theatre (now Main Art Theatre) in Royal Oak, Michigan. During the 1980s and early 1990s, they would purchase drive-ins in Monroe and Adrian and indoor theaters in Waterford, Livonia, Brighton (the chain's first first-run theater) and the Norwest Theater in Detroit. In 1989, the drive-in in Adrian was demolished and replaced in June 1990 by the MJR Adrian Cinema 6, which added four screens to become the MJR Adrian Cinema 10 in 1997. The chain took its name from its original slogan, "Movies Just Right." MJR's current slogan, implemented in 2001, is "It's More Fun at MJR," as heard on its advertising jingle which appears in the chain's policy trailer.During the 1990s, MJR would begin building more multiplex cinemas, including an 12-screen (later expanded to 16-screen) theater in Chesterfield Township in 1995 and an 11-(now 16-)screen theater in Waterford which replaced the Waterford Twin and Summit Place 3 Cinema
