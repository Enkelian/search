Ulverston
Ulverston is a market town in the South Lakeland district of Cumbria, England. Historically in Lancashire, it is in the Furness area 8 miles (13 km) north-east of Barrow-in-Furness, 4 miles (7 km) south of the Lake District and just north-west of Morecambe Bay. Nearby places include Swarthmoor, Pennington and Rosside. The most visible landmark is the limestone Hoad Monument built in 1850 to commemorate statesman and local resident Sir John Barrow. It offers views that include Morecambe Bay and parts of the Lake District. Ulverston Canal, no longer navigable but once vital to the town's economy, is marked by an art installation.

In the north are hills such as Coniston Old Man. The settlements of the parish are mainly concentrated in the eastern part.
