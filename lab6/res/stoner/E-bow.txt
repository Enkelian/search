The EBow is monophonic, and drives one string at a time, producing a sound reminiscent of using a bow on the strings.The name EBow stands for "Electronic Bow" or Energy Bow (often spelled E-bow in common usage).

In later years, five subsequent EBow models were introduced, all of which consisted of internal variations of the original EBow circuit and actuator coils, as well as color changes to the original plastic shell and EBow logotype, both of which remained
