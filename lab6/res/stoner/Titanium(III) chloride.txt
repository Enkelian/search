Titanium(III) chloride
Titanium(III) chloride is the inorganic compound with the formula TiCl3. At least four distinct species have this formula; additionally hydrated derivatives are known. TiCl3 is one of the most common halides of titanium and is an important catalyst for the manufacture of polyolefins. Structure and bonding In TiCl3, each Ti atom has one d electron, rendering its derivatives paramagnetic, i.e. the substance is attracted into a magnetic field. Solutions of titanium(III) chloride are violet, which arises from excitations of its d-electron. The colour is not very intense since the transition is forbidden by the Laporte selection rule. Four solid forms or polymorphs of TiCl3 are known. All feature titanium in an octahedral coordination sphere. These forms can be distinguished by crystallography as well as by their magnetic properties, which probes exchange interactions. β-TiCl3 crystallizes as brown needles. Its structure consists of chains of TiCl6 octahedra that share opposite faces such that the closest Ti—Ti contact is 2.91 Å. This short distance indicates strong metal-metal interactions (See Figure in upper right). The three violet "layered" forms, named for their color and their tendency to flake, are called alpha, gamma, and delta. In α-TiCl3, the chloride anions are hexagonal close-packed. In γ-TiCl3,
