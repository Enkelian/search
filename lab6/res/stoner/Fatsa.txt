Fatsa
Fatsa is a town and a district of Ordu Province in the central Black Sea region of Turkey. Population from Fatsa is more than 115,000. Name The oldest recorded name of the town is Polemonion (Ancient Greek: Πολεμώνιον, Latinized as Polemonium), after Polemon I of Pontus. A derivative of Polemonion, i.e. Bolaman, is the modern name of the river passing through Fatsa (the river is the ancient Sidenus). The present name, Fatsa, has been influenced by modern Greek Φάτσα or Φάτσα Πόντου (φἀτσα is derived from Italian faccia), which translates as "face or housefront on the sea", but has in fact mutated from Fanizan, the name of the daughter of King Pharnaces II of Pontus, through Fanise, Phadisana (Greek: Φαδισανή), Phadsane Phatisanê Vadisani (Greek: Βαδισανή), Phabda, Pytane, Facha, Fatsah into today's Fatsa. Apart from Polemonion, another Greek name of the town was Side. History Antiquity The history of Fatsa goes back to antiquity, when the coast was settled by Cimmerians, and Pontic Greeks in the centuries BC. The ruins on Mount Çıngırt (the ancient rock tombs and vaults) are from this period. Roman and Byzantine periods Fatsa was first mentioned, in the era of the Kingdom of Pontus, as Polemonium,
