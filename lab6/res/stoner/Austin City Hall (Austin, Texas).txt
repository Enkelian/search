Austin City Hall (Austin, Texas)
Austin City Hall is the seat of Austin municipal government, located at 301 W 2nd St in downtown Austin, Texas (USA). The current building was completed in 2004. It is the meeting place for the Austin City Council. Austin formerly operated its City Hall at 124 West 8th Street. Antoine Predock and Cotera + Reed Architects designed a new city hall building, which was intended to reflect what The Dallas Morning News referred to as a “crazy-quilt vitality, that embraces everything from country music to environmental protests and high-tech swagger.” The new city hall, built from recycled materials, has solar panels in its garage. The City Hall at 301 W 2nd St opened in November 2004. References External links Official website
