University House, Berkeley
The University House is a building on the campus of the University of California, Berkeley. Designed by the architect Albert Pissis, it was formerly the home of the president of the University of California, but is now the home of the Chancellor of the Berkeley campus. It is actually the only residence in the campus's central core, as all student housing lies outside the core campus, but within walking distance. The Chancellor and his/her spouse usually live in the private quarters on the second floor of the home, while the ground floor is used for receptions and other events. The home features art on loan from the UC Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive. == References ==
