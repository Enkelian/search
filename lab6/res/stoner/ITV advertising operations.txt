ITV advertising operations
The system in theory was each individual ITV franchise would sell its own airtime, including Channel 4 in their areas, which meant many stations were able to charge high prices of slots. Over the course of the 1980s an increase in competition from cable and satellite systems and even Channel 4 from January 1993, began a decrease in advertisement revenue for many ITV stations. In 1989, two ITV companies, Central Independent Television and Anglia Television, became the first to have a joint sales team via a single organisations to deal with advertising, which allowed for reduced operational costs while offering a larger number of potential customers. By 1992, areas with "sales house" were reported in having the best areas for advertising revenue.From January to July 1993, the remaining ITV companies (Scottish Television, HTV, Grampian and Westcountry as well as S4C) which were not initially part of "sales house" created their own joint operations to help improve their sales operations, before moving to other more established sales groups within ITV.
