Cornrows
Cornrows or braids, also called canerows in the Caribbean, are a style of hair braiding, in which the hair is braided very close to the scalp, using an underhand, upward motion to make a continuous, raised row. Cornrows are often formed in simple, straight lines, as the name implies, but they can also be formed in elaborate geometric or curvilinear designs. Depending on the region of the world, cornrows are worn by men or women, or both, and are sometimes adorned with beads, hair cuffs or cowry shells. The duration of weaving cornrow braids may take up to about 5 hours, depending on its quantity and width. Often favored for their easy maintenance, cornrows can be left in for weeks at a time if maintained through careful washing of the hair and regular oiling of the scalp. Braids pulled too tight or worn for unreasonable lengths of time can cause a type of hair loss known as traction alopecia. History Cornrows are a traditional way of styling hair in different global areas. Depictions of women with cornrows have been found in Stone Age paintings in the Tassili Plateau of the Sahara, and have been dated as far back as 3000
