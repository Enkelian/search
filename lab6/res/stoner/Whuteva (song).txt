There's Something About Remy: Based on a True Story is the debut studio album by American rapper Remy Ma. It was released on February 7, 2006 by SRC Records, Universal Records and Terror Squad Entertainment. The album's release date served as the sixth anniversary of her mentor Big Pun's death. The title and cover art coincides with the 1998 film There's Something About Mary. The album sold over 35,000 copies in its first week and sold over 160,000 copies solely in the United States due to the Record Label giving very little promotion which left Remy performing Indie duties on a Mainstream contract which she quickly cut short.

There's Something About Remy: Based On A True Story was the only album by a female rapper to chart on Billboard's Year End Top R&B/HipHop Album chart in 2006 at number 92.
