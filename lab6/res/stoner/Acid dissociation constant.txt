Acid dissociation constant
An acid dissociation constant, Ka, (also known as acidity constant, or acid-ionization constant) is a quantitative measure of the strength of an acid in solution. It is the equilibrium constant for a chemical reaction HA ↽ − − ⇀ A − + H + {\displaystyle {\ce {HA <=> A^- + H^+}}} known as dissociation in the context of acid–base reactions. The chemical species HA is an acid that dissociates into A−, the conjugate base of the acid and a hydrogen ion, H+. The system is said to be in equilibrium when the concentrations of its components will not change with the passing of time, because both forward and backward reactions are occurring at the same rate.The dissociation constant is defined by K a = [ A − ] [ H + ] [ H A ] {\displaystyle K_{\mathrm {a} }=\mathrm {\frac {[A^{-}][H^{+}]}{[HA]}} } or p K a = − log 10 ⁡ K a = log 10 ⁡ [ HA ] [ A − ] [ H + ] {\displaystyle pK_{{\ce {a}}}=-\log _{10}K_{a}=\log _{10}{\frac {{\ce {[HA]}}}{[{\ce {A^-}}][{\ce {H+}}]}}} where quantities in square brackets represent the concentrations of the species at equilibrium.
