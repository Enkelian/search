Celebration Cinema
Celebration Cinema is a movie theater chain owned and operated by Studio C (formerly known as Loeks Theatres, Inc.) with headquarters in Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA. Its theatres serve the cities and surrounding areas of Grand Rapids, Lansing, Muskegon, Benton Harbor/St. Joseph, Portage/Kalamazoo, and Mount Pleasant. An average of 5.5 million customers see movies annually through Studio C's Celebration Cinemas locations. The Grand Rapids North, Lansing, and Portage locations feature IMAX theatres. RiverTown Crossings and Lansing feature MOPIX Rear Window Technology for the deaf and hard of hearing, and most locations feature DLP Digital cinema by Christie. In 2007, Loeks Theatres, Inc. purchased two theatres from Plano, Texas-based Cinemark. The theatres are located in RiverTown Crossings in Grandville and the Woodland Mall in Kentwood. The 20-screen theatre has been renamed Celebration! Rivertown and the 14-screen theatre has been renamed Celebration Woodland after their respective malls. The purchase was an effort of Loeks Theatres to continue expansion in the West Michigan area. In 2018, Loeks Theatres, Inc changed their company name to Studio C. The name change is an effort to create a central brand name for all of its operations. The name is a homage to the former Studio 28
