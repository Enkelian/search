Weingart Stadium
Weingart Stadium (formerly ELAC Stadium) is a 22,355-capacity multi-purpose stadium located at East Los Angeles College, in Monterey Park, California. It was built in 1951 at a cost of $3.1 million, and following renovations in 1984 it was renamed after philanthropist Ben Weingart. The stadium played host to all 1984 Olympic field hockey matches. US Field Hockey played a home game here in 1990. The Los Angeles Salsa soccer club called Weingart home in the early 1990s. It is one of the only mid-size stadiums in the western United States that is retrofitted with turf-playing surface certified by the Federation International de Football Association (FIFA). Today, although it remains home to the East Los Angeles College football team, it is best known as the site of the annual Garfield High Schoolâ€“Roosevelt High School football game, better known as the East Los Angeles Classic, which has been responsible for the Stadium's largest crowds, numbering over 25,000. Commencement ceremonies for local high schools such as Schurr High School in Montebello, Alhambra High School in Alhambra and Garfield High School in Los Angeles are held at Weingart Stadium.
