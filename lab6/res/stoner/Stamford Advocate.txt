Stamford Advocate
The Advocate is a seven-day daily newspaper based in Stamford, Connecticut. The paper is owned and operated by Hearst Communications, a multinational corporate media conglomerate with $4 billion in revenues. The Advocate circulates in Stamford and the nearby southwestern Connecticut towns of Darien and New Canaan. The paper's headquarters moved in 2008 from downtown Stamford, across the street from the Stamford Government Center, to the Riverbend complex in the Springdale section of Stamford. Coverage In addition to the regular focus on local news, sports and business, The Advocate pays special attention to the workings of Metro-North Railroad, since many in southwestern Connecticut commute by train. The Advocate' Website was launched in 1999. In early 2007, the site started featuring message boards. The site also features a "UConn Nation" tab focusing on University of Connecticut athletics. History The Advocate has been called Stamford's oldest continuing business. The Intelligencer The paper's earliest origins come from The Intelligencer, a newspaper originally run out of a small office on the south side of West Park (now Columbus Park in downtown Stamford) in April 1829. William Henry "Hen" Holly installed a printing press there, but despite some support from the community, he closed the publication
