A Night at the Opera Tour
The A Night at the Opera Tour (advertized as A Night at the Opera with Queen) was a concert tour by Queen to promote A Night at the Opera. It spanned 1975 and 1976, and covered the UK, the US, Japan, and Australia. It marked the debut of "Bohemian Rhapsody", which would be played at every Queen gig thereafter. The DVD A Night at the Odeon is taken from the Christmas Eve concert at the Hammersmith Odeon. "It's quite something to watch", said Brian May. "We were just a four-piece, but we made a lot of noise. I'm quite shocked at how good it was. We were incredibly tight and, at the same time – because we knew each other so well – very loose in terms of improvisation." Tour band Freddie Mercury: Lead vocals, piano, tambourine. Brian May: Guitar, backing vocals, banjo ("Bring Back That Leroy Brown"). Roger Taylor: Drums, backing vocals. John Deacon: Bass guitar, additional vocals, triangle. Opening acts Mr Big (Europe) Cate Brothers (North America, select dates) Ray Burton (Australia, select dates) The Bellamy Brothers (Detroit) Foghat (Cincinnati) Bob Seger & the Silver Bullet Band (Saginaw, St. Louis, Indianapolis) Leslie West (Fort Wayne, Milwaukee) John Sebastian
