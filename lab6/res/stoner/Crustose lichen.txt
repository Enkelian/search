Crustose lichen
Crustose lichens form a crust that strongly adheres to the substrate (soil, rock, tree bark, etc.), making separation from the substrate impossible without destruction. The basic structure of crustose lichens consists of a cortex layer, an algal layer, and a medulla. The upper cortex layer is differentiated and is usually pigmented. The algal layer lies beneath the cortex. The medulla fastens the lichen to the substrate and is made up of fungal hyphae. The surface of crustose lichens is characterized by branching cracks that periodically close in response to climatic variations such as alternate wetting and drying regimes. Subtypes Powdery – considered as the simplest subtype due to the absence of an organized thallus.The thallus appears powdery. E.g. Genera Lepraria, VezdaeaEndolithic – grows inside the rock, usually in interstitial spaces between mineral grains. Theupper cortex is usually developed. E.g. Genus LecideaEpilithic – grows on top of the rock without penetrating the rock substrate.E.g. Acarospora fuscataEpiphloeodal – grows only on the surface of plants.E.g. Lecania naegeliiEndophloeodic – grows underneath the cuticle of leaves or stems.E.g. Amandinea punctataSquamulose – has a scale-like appearance resulting from partial separation from substrate.It is an intermediate form between crustose and foliose. E.g. Genus Psora, Catapyrenium, CorisciumPeltate
