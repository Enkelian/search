Canadian Online Explorer
Canoe.com is an English-language Canadian portal site and website network, and is a subsidiary of Postmedia Network. The French-language version continues to use the former name for both sites, Canoe.ca, and is owned by Quebecor Media. The phrase Canadian Online Explorer appears in the header of the English version of the site; the name is also evidently a play on words on canoe (or canoÃ« in French). Canoe's head office is in Toronto at 333 King Street East.The Canoe Network attracts over 7.7 million monthly visitors and includes separate English and French portals at en.canoe.com and fr.canoe.ca, information verticals like Cnews, SLAM!, JAM! and Lifewise, as well as the Sun Media newspaper sites. Canoe.com also offers online services in the fields of employment and continuing education (Jobboom.com), housing (Homes-Extra.ca), automobiles (Autonet.ca and ASL Internet. ASL Internet is an abbreviated Aged Stock Limited incorporated in 2002 by James Kovacs and sold to Canoe in 2008), personals (reseaucontact.com), social networks (space.canoe.ca), classified ads (classifiedextra.ca) and advertising solutions (canoeklix.ca). == References ==
