King of Rock and Roll (song)
"King of Rock and Roll" is the first track and third single released from heavy metal band Dio's 1985 LP, Sacred Heart. The band's ninth single, it was released only in Spain in 1986. The sleeve that the single came in was black and white with the same picture on both the A and B sides. It is not a live recordingâ€”the crowd noise on the track was dubbed in at the studio.
