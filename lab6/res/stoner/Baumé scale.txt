Baumé scale
The Baumé scale is a pair of hydrometer scales developed by French pharmacist Antoine Baumé in 1768 to measure density of various liquids. The unit of the Baumé scale has been notated variously as degrees Baumé, B°, Bé° and simply Baumé (the accent is not always present). One scale measures the density of liquids heavier than water and the other, liquids lighter than water. The Baumé of distilled water is 0. The API gravity scale is based on errors in early implementations of the Baumé scale. Conversions The relationship between specific gravity (s.g.) (relative density) and degrees Baumé is a function of the temperature. Different versions of the scale may use different reference temperatures. Different conversions formulae can therefore be found in various handbooks. As an example, a recent handbook states the conversions between specific gravity and degrees Baumé at a temperature of 60 °F (16 °C): For liquids more dense than water, given the degrees Baumé, the specific gravity is: s.g. = 145 145 − d e g r e e s B a u m e ´ {\displaystyle {\text{s.g.}}={\frac {145}{145-\mathrm {degrees\ Baum{\acute {e}}} }}} For liquids more dense than water, given the specific gravity, the degrees Baumé is:
