Career Stang once claimed he gained his break in radio by sending a postcard to a New York station requesting an audition, was accepted, and then bought his own ticket to New York from Chelsea, Massachusetts, with the money set aside for his mother's anniversary gift. True or not, Stang worked on New York–based network radio shows as a boy, appearing on children's programs such as The Horn and Hardart Children's Hour and Let's Pretend.
