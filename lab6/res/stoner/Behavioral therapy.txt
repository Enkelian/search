Behavioral therapy
Behavior therapy or behavioral psychotherapy is a broad term referring to clinical psychotherapy that uses techniques derived from behaviorism. Those who practice behavior therapy tend to look at specific, learned behaviors and how the environment influences those behaviors. Those who practice behavior therapy are called behaviourists, or behavior analysts. They tend to look for treatment outcomes that are objectively measurable. Behavior therapy does not involve one specific method but it has a wide range of techniques that can be used to treat a person's psychological problems. Traditional behavior therapy draws from respondent conditioning and operant conditioning to solve patients problems. Behavioral psychotherapy is sometimes juxtaposed with cognitive psychotherapy, while cognitive behavioral therapy integrates aspects of both approaches. Applied behavior analysis (ABA) is the application of behavior analysis that focuses on assessing how environmental variables influence learning principles, particularly respondent and operant conditioning, to identify potential behavior-change procedures, which are frequently used throughout clinical therapy. Cognitive-behavior therapy views cognition and emotions as preceding overt behavior with treatment plans in psychotherapy to lessen the issue. Hallmark techniques of behaviour therapies are overlapping components of cognitive psychology, in addition to behaviour analytic principles of counterconditioning, punishment, habituation, and functional analysis (FA).
