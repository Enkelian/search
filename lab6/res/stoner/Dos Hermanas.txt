Dos Hermanas
Dos Hermanas (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈdos eɾˈmanas]) is a Spanish city 15 km (9.3 mi) south of Seville in Andalusia, with a population of 131,317 as of 2015. History The city's name, which means "two sisters", dates from its founding in 1248 by King Ferdinand III of Castile and honours Elvira and Estefanía Nazareno, the two sisters of Gonzalo Nazareno, one of the king's principal military commanders. For this reason natives of Dos Hermanas are called nazarenos/as. In Tirso de Molina's play El burlador de Sevilla y convidado de piedra (1612-1620), Dos Hermanas is mentioned as the place where Don Juan Tenorio manages to interpose himself in the marriage of two plebeians, Arminta and Batricio, whom he cleverly deceives. The Trickster of Seville and Stone Guest is the play from which the myth of "Don Juan" derives the name. Economy The main economic activities of the city today are the production and distribution of olive oil and "Spanish olives", together with a significant number of service industries.
