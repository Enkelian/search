William Buckland DD, FRS (12 March 1784 â€“ 14 August 1856) was an English theologian who became Dean of Westminster. He was also a geologist and palaeontologist. He wrote the first full account of a fossil dinosaur, which he named Megalosaurus. His work proved that Kirkdale Cave had been a prehistoric hyena den, for which he was awarded the Copley Medal. It was praised as an example of how scientific analysis could reconstruct distant events. He pioneered the use of fossilised faeces in reconstructing ecosystems, coining the term coprolites.

It had emerged as a way to reconcile the scriptural account with discoveries in geology suggesting the earth was very old.
