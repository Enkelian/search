Epicatechin gallate
Epicatechin gallate (ECG) is a flavan-3-ol, a type of flavonoid, present in green tea. It is also reported in buckwheat and in grape.The tea component epicatechin gallate is being researched because in vitro experiments showed it can reverse methicillin resistance in bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus. Nevertheless, the compound is significantly degraded by steeping in boiling water, unlike related catechins.Epicatechin, as well as many other flavonoids, has been found to act as a non-selective antagonist of the opioid receptors, albeit with somewhat low affinity.
