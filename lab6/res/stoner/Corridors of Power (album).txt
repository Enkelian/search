Corridors of Power (album)
Corridors of Power is the second solo studio album by Irish guitarist Gary Moore, released in 1982. The album contains a cover of the Free song "Wishing Well". The track "End of the World" features Jack Bruce of Cream sharing lead vocals with Moore. Moore would later join with Bruce again on the Bruce-Baker-Moore project in 1993. The first 25,000 vinyl copies of Corridors of Power came with a bonus EP featuring three live tracks recorded at the Marquee, London on 25 August 1982. Japanese rock singer Mari Hamada covered "Love Can Make a Fool of You" (Retitled as "Love, Love, Love") on her 1985 album Rainbow Dream. As a nod to Corridors of Power, American guitarist Jeff Kollman named his 2012 solo album Silence in the Corridor, the title track of which is a tribute to Moore.
