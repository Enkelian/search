BUSINESSEUROPE
The Confederation of European Business, shortened BusinessEurope, is a lobby group representing enterprises of all sizes in the European Union (EU) and seven non-EU European countries. Members of the confederation are 40 national industry and employers' organizations. The current president of the confederation is Pierre Gattaz, while the Director General is Markus J. Beyrer. Based in Brussels, the confederation is officially recognised as a social partner at European level, is involved in a range of economic and social decisions and cooperates with a number of stakeholders and business partners. It promotes the interests of corporate citizens to ensure that public policy supports the European economy. It is generally considered the strongest interest organisation in Brussels and represents 20 million companies through its member trade associations in 35 European countries. History In 2014, Unilever terminated its membership in BusinessEurope's Advisory and Support Group, because it opposed the organisation's stance on carbon dioxide emissions.
