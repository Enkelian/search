Unincorporated association
Under English law, an unincorporated association is a group of people who come together (1) for a common purpose (unless the purpose is profit) (2) intending to create a legally binding relationship between themselves.The range of possible unincorporated associations is limitless, but typical examples include: An amateur football team who agree to hire a pitch once a week and split the cost. Residents of a street who agree to pay into a 'kitty' for street sweeping, etc. A trade union A professional associationUnincorporated associations are cheap and easy to form, requiring a bare minimum of formalities to bring them into existence (and can even be formed without their members realising it). They are also extremely flexible, with examples of tiny associations of just a few people, and national organisations with thousands of members. From a legal point of view, the most significant feature of an association is that they are unincorporated. This means they are generally unable, in their own name, to own property, to enter into contracts, and to commit (or defend themselves against) a wrong in tort. Definition There is no statutory definition of an unincorporated association, but there are judicial definitions. Lord Justice Lawton in Conservative and
