Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois
The Church of Saint-Germain-l'Auxerrois is a Roman Catholic church in Paris situated at 2 Place du Louvre. It used to be the parish church for inhabitants of the neighbouring Louvre Palace. Founded in the 7th century, the church was rebuilt many times over several centuries. The existing building was erected mostly in the 15th century, though some portions date to the late 13th century. It now has construction in Romanesque, Gothic and Renaissance styles. The most striking exterior feature is the porch, with a rose window and a balustrade above which encircles the whole church, a work of Jean Gaussel (1435–39).The belfry, which is older than the main building, was built up and completely remodeled by Théodore Ballu between 1858 and 1863. Among the treasures preserved inside are a 15th-century wooden statue of Saint Germain, a stone carved statue of Saint-Vincent, a stone sculpture of Isabelle of France, a Flemish altarpiece carved from wood and the famous "churchwarden's pew" on which important people sat, made in 1683 by François Le Mercier from drawings by Charles Le Brun.During the Wars of Religion, its bell, "Marie", sounded on the night of 23 August 1572, marking the beginning of the St. Bartholomew's Day
