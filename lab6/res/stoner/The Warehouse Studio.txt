The Warehouse Studio
The Warehouse Studio is a multi-media recording facility and photography studio in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, owned by Bryan Adams. Building Originally built by the Oppenheimer Brothers in June 1886 as Vancouver's first wholesale grocery business, it also served as Vancouver's City Hall after the city was decimated by fire. For most of its 115+ year history the building held a glass factory and storage warehouse for Pilkington Glass Company.The building later fell into terrible disrepair and became abandoned. In 1989 the property at 100-102 Powell St. was purchased by Bryan Adams.The building at 102 Powell was gutted and converted into a parking lot with green space hidden behind a street front facade. The 2nd building, the original Oppenheimer Warehouse on the corner was restored and converted into a three-storey state of the art studio. Importantly, Adams was sure to maintain the building's character and charm by preserving the original brick and beam construction. The project took nearly a decade to complete.In 1998, The Warehouse Studio received a City of Vancouver Heritage Award for outstanding restoration of a historic building.
