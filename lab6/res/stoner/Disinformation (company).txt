Disinformation (company)
The Disinformation Company (abbreviated as Disinfo) was a privately held, limited American publishing company until 2012 when it was sold to Red Wheel/Weiser/Conari. It also owned Disnformation Books, which focused on current affairs titles and books exposing alleged conspiracy theories, occultism, politics, news oddities, and purported disinformation. It is headquartered in New York City, New York. Arguably, its most visible publications to date are 50 Things You're Not Supposed to Know and the Everything You Know About [subject] Is Wrong series, both by the company's editor-at-large Russ Kick. History In 1996, Tele-Communications Inc. (now Comcast) funded a Hollywood-based Internet initiative responsible for online projects like the Getty Museum and an Internet-based political humor soap opera entitled Candidate 96. The initiative launched its own interactive website, featuring the tag line; "everything you know is wrong". Soon after the site's launch, TCI cancelled funding and support for the site.The founding team kept it going, being nominated for an award for politics in the first Webby Awards ceremony. The Disinformation Company, as it was now known, was then acquired by Razorfish. Eventually, the Disinformation Company became privately held. In addition to publishing books, the company also had a home video division as well
