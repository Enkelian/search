2011 UCLA Bruins football team
The 2011 UCLA Bruins football team represented the University of California, Los Angeles in the 2011 NCAA Division I FBS football season. The team was coached during the regular season by fourth year head coach Rick Neuheisel and played their home games at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. Mike Johnson was named the interim head coach for the Kraft Fight Hunger Bowl after Neuheisel was fired. On November 25, 2011, with Colorado's defeat of Utah, the Bruins were declared the South Division champions. On November 28, 2011, UCLA announced that it had fired Neuheisel but would allow him to coach his final game in the first Pac-12 Football Championship Game on December 2, 2011. The Bruins were then defeated 49–31 in that game by Oregon at Autzen Stadium. The season concluded with a loss to Illinois, 20–14, in the Kraft Fight Hunger Bowl and completed a 6–8 overall record (5–4 in the Pac-12). With the loss to Illinois, UCLA became the first bowl-eligible team to ever lose eight games.
