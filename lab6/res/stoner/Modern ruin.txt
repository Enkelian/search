Modern ruin
Modern ruins is a neologism referring to the ruins of architecture constructed in the recent past, generally in the most recent century, or since the 19th century. The term is most frequently used by people performing urban exploration of man-made architecture that is abandoned or no longer accessible to the general public, such as structures abandoned through the process of urban decay. Enough documentation on these sites may have been lost over time that this unscientific exploration resembles archaeology of ancient ruins in the methods used to collect information. High-profile modern ruins include amusement parks, grain elevators, factories, power plants, missile silos, fallout shelters, hospitals, asylums, schools, poor houses and sanatoriums. Popularity Many sightseers find decay of uninhabited space to be profoundly beautiful, and some are also skilled freelance photographers who document what they see, as is the case with those who document some of the infrastructure of the former USSR. Ventures into abandoned structures are perhaps the most common example of urban exploration. At times, sites are entered first by locals and may suffer from large amounts of graffiti and other acts of vandalism, while other locations may be better preserved. In Japan, abandoned infrastructure is known as haikyo
