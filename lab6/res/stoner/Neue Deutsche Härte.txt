Neue Deutsche Härte
Neue Deutsche Härte (which means new German hardness in English), otherwise known as NDH, Tanzmetall and dance-metal, is a sub-genre of rock music that developed in Germany and Austria during the early and mid-1980s, 1990s and 2000s. Alluding to the style of neue Deutsche welle, the term was coined by the music press after the 1995 release of the German rock and metal band Rammstein's first studio album Herzeleid. Characteristics Neue Deutsche Härte describes a crossover style that is influenced by neue Deutsche welle, alternative metal and groove metal combining it with elements from electro-industrial and techno. The lyrics are generally in German. NDH uses the basic setup of instruments for metal: electric guitar, bass guitar, drums and vocals, along with keyboard, synthesizers, samples and sometimes additional percussion. Emphasis is on a demonstration of predominance, by over-pronouncing certain syllables and letters (such as the uvular or alveolar trill). The vocals are thus dominantly presenting in deep, male, and clean voice. Some bands use screaming and death growls, which is also common, being heard in certain songs by Oomph!, Rammstein, Joachim Witt, Megaherz and Eisbrecher. NDH imagery is often strongly masculine and militaristic. Guitars are tuned low, usually to drop D
