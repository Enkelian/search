Generalized anxiety disorder
Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is an anxiety disorder characterized by excessive, uncontrollable and often irrational worry about events or activities. This excessive worry often interferes with daily functioning, and sufferers are overly concerned about everyday matters such as health issues, money, death, family problems, friendship problems, interpersonal relationship problems, or work difficulties. Symptoms may include excessive worry, restlessness, trouble sleeping, feeling tired, irritability, sweating, and trembling.These symptoms must be consistent and ongoing, persisting at least six months, for a formal diagnosis of GAD. GAD is also common in individuals with a history of substance abuse and a family history of the disorder. Standardized rating scales such as GAD-7 can be used to assess severity of GAD symptoms.Medications which have been found to be useful include duloxetine, pregabalin, venlafaxine, and escitalopram.In a given year, about two percent of American adults and European adults experience GAD. Globally about 4% are affected at some point in their life. GAD is seen in women twice as frequently as men. Risk factors Genetics Genes are attributed to about a third of general anxiety disorder's variance. Individuals with a genetic predisposition for GAD are more likely to develop GAD, especially in response to a life stressor.
