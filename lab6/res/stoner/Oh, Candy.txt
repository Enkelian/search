Oh, Candy
"Oh, Candy" is a song by American rock band Cheap Trick, released in 1977 as their debut single from their debut studio album Cheap Trick. It was written by Rick Nielsen and produced by Jack Douglas. Background "Oh, Candy" is based on a true story of photographer Marshall Mintz, Cheap Trick's first photographer and a friend, who committed suicide by hanging. The name Candy referred to Mintz's initials, which shared the name of the popular candy M&Ms. Rather than call the song "Marshall Mintz" or "M & M", Nielsen decided to use "Candy" to make the song easier for listeners to identify with. In the 1998 Cheap Trick biography Reputation Is a Fragile Thing, Nielsen said: "I thought that calling the song "Marshall Mintz" sounded pretty stupid, so I put a little twist on it and called the song "Oh, Candy". Here was a guy who committed suicide, and I was asking him why. Obviously, the song makes the story sound like it's about a young woman. Nobody wants to hear about some older guy that I knew. I just tried to tell the story in such a way that as many people as possible could identify with it." A
