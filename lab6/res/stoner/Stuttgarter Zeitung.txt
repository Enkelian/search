Stuttgarter Zeitung
The Stuttgarter Zeitung ("Stuttgart newspaper") is a German-language daily newspaper (except Sundays) edited in Stuttgart, Baden-W端rttemberg, Germany, with a run of about 200,000 sold copies daily. History and profile It was first edited on 18 September 1945, just a few months after the end of the Second World War. With northern and central W端rttemberg being part of the American occupation zone from 1945 to 1949, it was the U.S. Information Control Division that issued the first publishing licence to the editors Josef Eberle, Karl Ackermann and Henry Bernhard during the first years of the paper's existence. Erich Schairer joined them as co-editor in the fall of 1946. After Schairers death, Eberle remained the editor until 1972. Today, its publishing house is S端dwestdeutsche Medien Holding. It is mainly read in Baden-W端rttemberg and therefore has a strong local and regional focus, but also has significant supra-regional, national and international sections, covered by separate respective editorial departments. The paper is the recipient of the European Newspaper Award in the category of regional newspaper by the European Newspapers Congress in 2009. References External links Official website
