Hydronium
In chemistry, hydronium is the common name for the aqueous cation H3O+, the type of oxonium ion produced by protonation of water. It is the positive ion present when an Arrhenius acid is dissolved in water, as Arrhenius acid molecules in solution give up a proton (a positive hydrogen ion, H+) to the surrounding water molecules (H2O). Determination of pH The concentration of hydronium ions determines a solution's pH. The concentration of hydroxide ions determines a solution's pOH. The molecules in pure water auto-dissociate (i.e.: react with each other) into hydronium and hydroxide ions in the following equilibrium: 2 H2O ⇌ OH− + H3O+In pure water, there is an equal number of hydroxide and hydronium ions, so it is a neutral solution. At 25 °C (77 °F), water has a pH of 7 and a pOH of 7 (this varies when the temperature changes: see self-ionization of water). A pH value less than 7 indicates an acidic solution, and a pH value more than 7 indicates a basic solution. Nomenclature According to IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry, the hydronium ion should be referred to as oxonium. Hydroxonium may also be used unambiguously to identify it.
