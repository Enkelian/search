Penrith, Cumbria
Penrith ( pen-RITH) is a market town and civil parish in the county of Cumbria, England. It lies less than 3 miles (5 km) outside the bounds of the Lake District National Park. Historically in Cumberland, Penrith's local authority is currently Eden District Council, which is based in the town. Penrith was formerly the seat of Penrith Urban and Rural District Councils. From 1974 to 2015, it was an unparished area with no town council of its own, but a civil parish was recreated in 2015, as Penrith Town Council. The first elections to the new council took place on 7 May 2015. Toponymy The etymology of the name has been debated.

An alternative has been suggested consisting of the same pen element meaning "head, end, top" + the equivalent of
