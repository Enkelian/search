Nikolay Shvernik
Nikolai Mikhailovich Shvernik (Russian: Никола́й Миха́йлович Шве́рник, 19 May [O.S. 7 May] 1888 – 24 December 1970) was a Soviet politician and Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet (or President of the USSR) from 19 March 1946 until 15 March 1953. Though the titular Soviet head of state, Shvernik had, in fact, little power because the real authority lay with Joseph Stalin as General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Biography Shvernik was born in 1888 in St. Petersburg in a working-class family of Russian ethnicity. He joined the Bolsheviks in 1905. In 1924 he became a People's Commissar in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and became a full member of the Central Committee of the party in 1925. In 1927 he was demoted and sent to the Urals to head the local party organization. Stalin found him a loyal supporter of his policy of rapid industrialisation and moved him back to Moscow in 1929 making him chairman of the Metallurgist Trade Union. He resumed his rise in the party becoming a member of the Orgburo and the party Secretariat. He also served as first secretary of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions
