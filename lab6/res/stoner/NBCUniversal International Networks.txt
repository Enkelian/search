NBCUniversal International Networks
NBCUniversal International Networks, formerly NBC Universal Global Networks and Universal Networks International, is a part of NBCUniversal, owned by Comcast. History When NBCUniversal was formed in 2004, it owned many entertainment television channels in Europe and Latin America. These were mostly a few international versions of the Sci Fi Channel, three action and suspense series channels in Europe, the Italian Studio Universal channel and the Latin American version of the USA Network. In 2007, NBC Universal acquired Sparrowhawk Media Group, which at the time was a British private equity-backed media company managing a collection of digital television channels, and integrated it into NBC Universal Global Networks. The purchase more than doubled the number of international channels in NBC Universal's portfolio. Sparrowhawk's crown jewel was an international network of drama channels available on most continents under the Hallmark Channel brand, but Diva TV, Movies 24, and KidsCo channels were also available. On 5 October 2009, it was announced that the venture would be renamed Universal Networks International and focus its attention on five channel brands, all with "Universal" in their name: Universal Channel 13th Street Universal Syfy Universal Diva Universal Studio UniversalAltogether, the company broadcast about 70 different channels by 2009.The
