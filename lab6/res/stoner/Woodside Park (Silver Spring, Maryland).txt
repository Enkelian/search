Woodside Park (Silver Spring, Maryland)
Woodside Park is a neighborhood located in Silver Spring, Maryland, in the United States. Early history Woodside Park began as the Alton Farm, country estate of Crosby Noyes, a prominent Washingtonian and owner of the Washington Evening Star newspaper. Upon his death in 1908, his will gave the land to his children with a provision that his widow could live on the estate until her death. She survived until 1914.
