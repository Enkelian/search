NCAA Division I Women's Lacrosse Championship
The annual NCAA Division I Women's Lacrosse Championship tournament has determined the top women's lacrosse team in the NCAA Division I since 1982. University of Maryland is the champion, having defeated Boston College in the 2019 NCAA Division I Women's Lacrosse Championship final. History Lacrosse was one of twelve women's sports added to the NCAA championship program for the 1981-82 school year, as the NCAA engaged in battle with the AIAW for sole governance of women's collegiate sports. The AIAW continued to conduct its established championship program in the same twelve (and other) sports; however, after a year of dual women's championships, the AIAW held its last championship in 1982 and ceased operation. Separate championships are held for Division II, founded in 2001, and Division III, founded in 1985.
