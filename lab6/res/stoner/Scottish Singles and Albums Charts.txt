The Scottish Singles Chart and Scottish Albums Chart are charts compiled by the Official Charts Company, based on physical and digital sales in Scotland. The Scottish Singles Chart and Scottish Albums Chart are national listings that indicate how sales towards the UK Singles Chart and UK Albums Chart are faring in Scotland.
