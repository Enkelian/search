Mick Abrahams
Michael Timothy Abrahams (born 7 April 1943) is an English guitarist and band leader, best known as being the original guitarist for Jethro Tull. Jethro Tull Abrahams was born in Luton, Bedfordshire. He played on the album This Was recorded by Jethro Tull in 1968, but conflicts between Abrahams and Ian Anderson over the musical direction of the band led Abrahams to leave once the album was finished. Abrahams wanted to pursue a more blues/rock direction, while Anderson wanted to incorporate more overt folk and jazz influences. He was replaced first by Earth (an early moniker for Black Sabbath's original lineup) guitarist Tony Iommi who would leave Tull after only a few weeks to return to his band, which would later evolve into Black Sabbath, and then by Martin Barre who remained with Jethro Tull until the band initially ceased in 2011. Blodwyn Pig and later career Abrahams went on to found Blodwyn Pig and the group recorded two albums, Ahead Rings Out (1969) and Getting to This (1970) before breaking up in 1970. Abrahams soldiered on with the short-lived Wommett, then the Mick Abrahams Band and has continued to release albums by himself and with reunited versions of Blodwyn
