FishCenter Live
FishCenter Live (also shortened to FishCenter or FC Live or just FCL) is an American talk show hosted by Dave Bonawits, Andrew Choe, Matt Harrigan, Christina Loranger, and Max Simonet. It premiered on the official website of Adult Swim in September 2014; it started airing on the network proper in February 2015. Summary and production FishCenter Live is presented as a weekday call-in talk show narrating over footage of tropical fish swimming around in a fish tank. The fish are ranked according to their points, which are awarded when the fish complete a number of challenges. These challenges include "Coin Hunt", floating over coins that are superimposed on the video feed. The show is hosted by Dave Bonawits, Andrew Choe, Matt Harrigan, Christina Loranger, and Max Simonet, employees from the digital department room of Adult Swim. An original incarnation of the show involved a straight video feed of the fish tank, without narration. Commentary and a phone number for call-in segments were later added. Initially, callers were mostly other Adult Swim employees; when the competition portion was added, the hosts saw an increase of outside callers. Later, both David Bonawits and Max Simonet co-created Tender Touches. Games The callers, fish,
