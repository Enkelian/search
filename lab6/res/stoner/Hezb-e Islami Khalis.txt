Hezb-e Islami Khalis
Hezb-e Islami Khalis (Pashto: حزب اسلامی خالص‎) is an Afghan political movement under Maulawi Khalis, who separated from Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Islami and formed his own resistance group in 1979. The two parties were distinguished as Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin and Hezb-e Islami Khalis, after the names of their respective leaders. The Khalis party was part of the "Peshawar Seven", who fought against the Soviet presence in Afghanistan. Among its most famous commanders were Abdul Haq, Amin Wardak and Jalaluddin Haqqani. Following Khalis' death in 2006, a power struggle ensued between his son Anwar ul Haq Mujahid and Haji Din Mohammad, the former governor of Kabul Province. Mohammad appears to have been successful in consolidating his control over much of the party. == References ==
