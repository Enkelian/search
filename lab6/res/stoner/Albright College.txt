Albright College
Albright College is a private liberal arts college in Reading, Pennsylvania affiliated with the United Methodist Church. It was founded in 1856. History Berks County's oldest institute of higher learning, Albright College traces its founding to 1856 when Union Seminary opened. Present-day Albright was formed by the mergers of several institutions. Albright Collegiate Institute opened in 1895 and was renamed Albright College three years later. Union Seminary became Central Pennsylvania College and, in 1902, merged with Albright College. Schuylkill College, previously called Schuylkill Seminary, merged with Albright College in 1928. Albright's campus relocated from Myerstown, to Schuylkill College's campus, which is the present location of Albright, at the base of Mount Penn in Reading. The College is named for Pennsylvania-German evangelical preacher Jacob Albright, who founded the Evangelical Association (later known as the Evangelical United Brethren Church). Born in 1759 in Douglass Township, (now Montgomery County) with the given name of Johannes Jacob Albrecht, the family changed their surname to "Albright" following Jacob's 1808 death.
