Sir William Timothy Gowers, (; born 20 November 1963) is a British mathematician. He is a Royal Society Research Professor at the Department of Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics at the University of Cambridge, where he also holds the Rouse Ball chair, and is a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1998, he received the Fields Medal for research connecting the fields of functional analysis and combinatorics. Education Gowers attended King's College School, Cambridge, as a choirboy in the King's College choir, and then Eton College as a King's Scholar. He completed his PhD, with a dissertation on Symmetric Structures in Banach Spaces at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1990, supervised by Béla Bollobás. In 1981, Gowers won a gold medal at the International Mathematical Olympiad with a perfect score. Career and research After his PhD, Gowers was elected to a Junior Research Fellowship at Trinity College. From 1991 until his return to Cambridge in 1995 he was lecturer at University College London. He was elected to the Rouse Ball Professorship at Cambridge in 1998. During 2000–2 he was visiting professor at Princeton University. Gowers initially worked on Banach spaces. He used combinatorial tools in proving several of Stefan Banach's conjectures
