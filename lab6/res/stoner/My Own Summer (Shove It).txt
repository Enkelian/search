"My Own Summer (Shove It)" is a single by American alternative metal band Deftones, their first to be taken from the album Around the Fur. It was released in 1997 by Maverick Records. It was Deftones' first charting single, reaching number 29 in the UK Singles Chart. The song has been described as alternative metal and nu metal. Music video The video for "My Own Summer (Shove It)", directed by Dean Karr, begins with a clip of a cage falling into the sea, and blood seeping out of it into the surrounding waters. It then moves to footage of the band playing on a set of floating anti-shark cages. Eventually, a shark appears and is seen to be eating a piece of meat, presumably the contents of the cage. At the end of the video, frontman Chino Moreno falls into the water and the video fades out. An interview with Moreno that takes place during the filming of the video was included on the DVD release of B-Sides & Rarities. Appearances in other media A version of the song was featured on the soundtrack of The Matrix. Track listing All tracks written by Deftones. All lyrics by Chino Moreno, except
