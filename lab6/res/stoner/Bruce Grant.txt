Views In a review of Creationism's Trojan Horse: The Wedge of Intelligent Design, Grant wrote: Neo-creationists imitate Paleyâ€™s designed-watch metaphor and peddle it like a Hong Kong Rolex, insisting it is authentic science and not religion. But of course it is religion: the intelligence in Intelligent Design demands the existence of a supernatural force or agent, so we might as well call that agent God, for short.
