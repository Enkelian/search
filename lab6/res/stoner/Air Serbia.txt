Air Serbia
Air Serbia (stylised as AirSERBIA; Serbian: Ер Србија, romanized: Er Srbija) is the flag carrier of Serbia. The company's headquarters is located in Belgrade, Serbia, and its main hub is Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport. In 2016, it was the fourth-largest legacy carrier in Southeastern Europe. The airline was formerly known as Jat Airways until it was renamed and rebranded in 2013. History Origins Air Serbia originated in 1927 when the first Serbian company for civil air transport Aeroput was formed. 1927 was also the year the nation's capital Belgrade became the hub of its operations, with the inauguration of an international airport. Aeroput became the flag carrier of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and, by the opening of numerous airfields throughout the country, significantly improved connections between the different regions. Besides providing passenger, mail and cargo service to its domestic destinations, Aeroput inaugurated its first regular scheduled international route Belgrade–Zagreb–Graz–Vienna in 1929. During the 1930s, it expanded by opening new routes to other destinations in Austria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, Turkey, Albania, and Italy. These new routes helped it position itself as a major regional airliner. Its fleet consisted in one Aeroput MMS-3, one Breguet 19/10, two Caudron C.449 Goéland,
