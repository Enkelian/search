Background "The Creep" was written by The Lonely Island during the summer of 2010. The comedy troupe, in the same fashion to the recording process for their debut, Incredibad, rented a house in Los Angeles and created a makeshift studio where they would record songs. Taccone first created the idea for the dance, and the troupe then decided that it would be best for Waters to introduce the song, as they were all fans of his work.
