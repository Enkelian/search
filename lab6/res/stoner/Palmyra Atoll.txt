Its 9 mi (14 km) of coastline has one anchorage known as West Lagoon. It is the northernmost of the Line Islands, and one of four American islands in the archipelago, along with Jarvis Island, Johnston Atoll and Kingman Reef. Palmyra Atoll is part of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument which makes up the largest marine protected area in the world.
