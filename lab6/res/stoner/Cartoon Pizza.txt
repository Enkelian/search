Cartoon Pizza
Cartoon Pizza is an American animation company located in Nashville. It was co-founded by Jim Jinkins and David Campbell as the successor to Jinkins's former company, Jumbo Pictures, Inc. A hallmark of both Jumbo Pictures and Cartoon Pizza has been their commitment to the continued use of hand-painted cel animation at a time when animated series are increasingly produced using digital ink and paint.The studio had partnered with several studios to help produce their shows, including Disney in 2001, Sesame Workshop in 2006, and Cuppa Coffee Studios. The studio was formerly headquartered in New York City until 2011, when the company relocated to Nashville, Tennessee. History In 2001, a year after Jim Jinkins' former company Jumbo Pictures, Inc. was closed by The Walt Disney Company, Jim Jinkins and David Campbell formed Cartoon Pizza as a successor company. Jinkins was helming the position as president, Campbell as CEO, Jack Spillum as the president of animated productions, Ellie Copeland as the vice president of finances and operations, and Beldeen Fortunato as the vice president of administration.In December 2001, Cartoon Pizza agreed to a two-year nonexclusive production deal with Sesame Workshop.
