Hyper (magazine)
Hyper is a multi-platform Australian video game magazine and Australia's longest running gaming magazine, published from 1993 to present day. History Hyper was launched in 1993 by Next Media with Stuart Clarke in the editor's seat. Clarke had previously edited Megazone; a then multi-platform magazine published by Sega Ozisoft, before being taken over by Mason Stewart publishing in September 1993 and being made Sega only. Clarke left Megazone at the time of the Mason Stewart takeover, when he was asked by Next Media publisher, Phil Keir, to start a new multi-platform gaming magazine. Clarke recounted the events in Hyper's 100th issue: "Just as I was starting to relax, Phil Keir, owner of Next Media and publisher of Rolling Stone, rang me at home one night to ask a few questions. Before I knew it he had asked me to set up a brand new games magazine â€“ one that I created and controlled completely! So after a few nano-seconds of thought I said, 'Um, okay then'. One of the first decisions was to make it a true multi-format title, covering the best games on all platforms." - Stuart Clarke, February 2002 issue 100 of Hyper On 28 April 2010, Hyper
