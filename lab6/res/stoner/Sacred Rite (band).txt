Sacred Rite (band)
Sacred Rite is an American heavy metal band formed in 1980 hailing from Honolulu, Hawaii. Sacred Rite was one of the two notable heavy metal bands from Honolulu, Hawaii (the other being Hawaii). The group's self-titled debut album was released in Europe on Axe Killer Records, which helped grow their fanbase and led to the band getting an opening act spot for the band Triumph during a tour stop in Hawaii. The band relocated from Honolulu to Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1987. Drummer Kevin Lum left the band in 1988 due to complications from diabetes, and later died in 2002 as a result of heart failure.
