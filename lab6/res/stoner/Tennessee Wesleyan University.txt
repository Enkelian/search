History Tennessee Wesleyan was founded in 1857 as Athens Female College. It consisted solely of one building (now Old College). In 1866 the name was altered to East Tennessee Wesleyan College, and in 1867 it became East Tennessee Wesleyan University. At that time, the college was one of only a handful of coeducational colleges in the Southern United States. In 1886, college president John F. Spence changed the name to Grant Memorial University in an attempt to receive financial support from Northern benefactors. In 1889, it merged with Chattanooga University to form U.S. Grant Memorial University (U.S. Grant University; U.S. being Grant's given names), becoming the consolidated university's Athens branch campus. Seventeen years later (1906), it was renamed the Athens School of the University
