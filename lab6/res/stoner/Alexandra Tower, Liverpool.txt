Alexandra Tower, Liverpool
Alexandra Tower is a residential tower located in the newly developed Prince's Dock area of Liverpool, England. It was constructed between 2005 and 2008 and upon completion became the sixth tallest building in Liverpool. The tower has a total 27 floors, with 201 apartments, reaching a height of 88 metres (290 ft).In March 2010, a 100 kilograms (220 lb) decorative glass panel shattered and fell from the building onto the ground below. The cause is not known, although it is thought that temperature fluctuations caused by overnight freezing and subsequent heating during the day may have been responsible. To date only some safety scaffolding remains in place to catch any falling debris. Gallery References External links Millennium Estates homepage AFL Architects homepage
