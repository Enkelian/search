History Buy.com (1997â€“2010) Buy.com originally sold only computers, at below cost, intending to bring in revenue through advertising and ancillary services such as sales of warranties and equipment leases, before expanding into numerous other categories, including software, books, videos and games. The company sold $125 million worth of goods and services in 1998, its first full year, beating Compaq's 1984 record for most first-year sales.After raising $120 million from Japanese tech company SoftBank in 1998 and 1999, founder Scott Blum sold a portion of his stake to SoftBank in 1999 shortly before Buy.com's $195 million initial public offering in early 2000. On February 8, 2000, Buy.com went public at $13 per share and rose to $37.50 per share that day, its peak price. Mr. Blum still owned approximately 48% of the company at the time of the IPO.
