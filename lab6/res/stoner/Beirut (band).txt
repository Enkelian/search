Beirut (band)
Beirut is an American band which was originally the solo musical project of Santa Fe native Zach Condon. Beirut's music combines elements of indie rock and world music. The band's first performance was in New York, in May 2006, to support its debut album, Gulag Orkestar.Condon named the band after Lebanon's capital, because of the city's history of conflict and as a place where cultures collide. Beirut performed in Lebanon for the first time in 2014, at the Byblos International Festival. History Early years Zach Condon was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on February 13, 1986.

Condon played trumpet in a jazz band as a teenager and cites jazz as a major influence.Condon attended Santa Fe High School, until dropping out when he was 17. Work at a cinema showing international films piqued his interest in Fellini arias, Sicilian funeral brass, and Balkan music.Condon attended community college for a short period, before traveling to Europe at the age of 17 with his older brother, Ryan.
