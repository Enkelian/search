Ultra vires
Ultra vires is a Latin phrase meaning "beyond the powers". An act which requires legal authority but is done without it, is characterised in law as ultra vires. Its opposite, an act done under proper authority, is intra vires ("within the powers"). Acts that are intra vires may equivalently be termed "valid" and those that are ultra vires "invalid". Legal issues relating to ultra vires can arise in a variety of contexts: Companies and other legal persons sometimes have limited legal capacity to act, and attempts to engage in activities beyond their legal capacity may be ultra vires. Most countries have restricted the doctrine of ultra vires in relation to companies by statute. Similarly, statutory and governmental bodies may have limits upon the acts and activities which they legally engage in. Subordinate legislation which is purported passed without the proper legal authority may be invalid as beyond the powers of the authority which issued it. Corporate law In corporate law, ultra vires describes acts attempted by a corporation that are beyond the scope of powers granted by the corporation's objects clause, articles of incorporation or in a clause in its Bylaws, in the laws authorizing a corporation's formation, or similar
