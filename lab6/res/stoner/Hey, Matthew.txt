Hey, Matthew
"Hey, Matthew" is a single released by the British musician Karel Fialka, in 1987. It was later included on his 1988 album, Human Animal.The song has instrumentation with only a synthesizer and a drum machine being used. The song follows the lyrics of the father (Fialka) questioning his son, Matthew, as to what he sees on television (to which a young child's voice responds: Dallas, Dynasty, Terrahawks, He-Man, Tom and Jerry, Dukes of Hazzard, Airwolf, Blue Thunder, Rambo, Road Runner, Daffy Duck and The A-Team); and what he wants to be when he grows up. The video follows the plot of the song, with the camera making it appear that the viewer is looking in on the family through the television. The song was Fialka's biggest chart hit, peaking at No. 9 in the UK Singles Chart and spending eight weeks in the listings. It also reached #15 in Germany and #29 on the U.S. Modern Rock chart. In 1997, both Karel and Matthew appeared on Never Mind the Buzzcocks in the Identity Parade lineup. Both were identified successfully.
