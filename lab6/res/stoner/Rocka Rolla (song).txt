Rocka Rolla (song)
"Rocka Rolla" is the debut single by British rock band Judas Priest, first released in August 1974, and later released as the title track of their first album the following month. This song was played live on The Old Grey Whistle Test. The song has several short guitar solos played by guitarist Glenn Tipton, an outro solo by K. K. Downing, as well as a harmonica solo played by vocalist Rob Halford. During live performances, Tipton's backing vocals were sung significantly higher than Halford's. The song often closed the shows on their early tours, and was extended into a lengthy jam. The B-side to the single for Rocka Rolla was another song from the same album, "Never Satisfied", which was co-written by Al Atkins. Personnel Rob Halford – lead vocals, harmonica K. K.
