Jardin d'Acclimatation
The Jardin d'Acclimatation (French pronunciation: ​[ʒaʁdɛ̃ daklimatasjɔ̃]) is a 19-hectare (47-acre) children's amusement park located in the northern part of the Bois de Boulogne in Paris, alongside the Exploradôme museum and other attractions. History Opened on 6 October 1860 by Napoléon III and Empress Eugénie, this Paris zoo was originally known as Jardin Zoologique d'Acclimatation, where plants and animals from the colonies could acclimatise to France's weather conditions. It was directed by Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, son of the naturalist Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, until his death in 1861. During the Siege of Paris (1870-1871), many of the animals in the zoo were cooked and served by chef Alexandre Étienne Choron. From 1877 until 1912, the Jardin Zoologique d'Acclimatation was converted to l'Acclimatation Anthropologique. In mid-colonialism, the curiosity of Parisians was attracted to the customs and lifestyles of foreign peoples. Nubians, Bushmen, Zulus, and many other African peoples were "exhibited" in a human zoo. The exhibitions were a huge success. The number of visitors to the Jardin doubled, reaching the million mark.In 1931 the last anthropological exhibition was closed down and since then the zoo - now the Jardin d'Acclimatation - has become a family-oriented leisure park, focusing on children's activities.
