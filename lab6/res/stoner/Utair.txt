Utair
Utair (Russian: ОАО «Авиакомпания «ЮТэйр») (MCX: UTAR) is a Russian low-cost airline with its head office at Khanty-Mansiysk Airport while its hubs are at Surgut International Airport and Vnukovo International Airport. It operates scheduled domestic and some international passenger services, scheduled helicopter services, and extensive charter flights with fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters in support of the oil and gas industry across western Siberia. History In February 1967, the Aeroflot Tyumen Directorate was set up to meet the transport requirements of the fast-growing oil and gas industry undergoing development in western Siberia. In the wake of the break-up of the Aeroflot organization, Tyumenaviatrans Aviation (TAT) was formed in 1991 to replace the Aeroflot Tyumen Directorate. TAT adopted the name of UTair in early 2003. The airline is owned by Khanty Mansiysk District administration (23%), Surgut City administration (19%), Russian shareholders and companies (33%), the Russian Federation (2%), and private foreign investors (20%). In October 2010, Utair announced plans to replace its Tupolev Tu-134 fleet with the Sukhoi Superjet 100. In December, UTair officially placed an order for 24 of the jets to enter service in 2013. Also in 2010, the airline named a Tu-154 aircraft after Boris Evdokimovich Sherbina, a Tyumenfigure.In
