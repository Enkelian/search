The modern road that mostly follows its course is classified as the A4421. Toponym The Domesday Book in 1086 does not mention Newton Purcell. The earliest known written record of Newton Purcell is a document from AD 1180 which records the place-name as Neuwenton. An entry in the Book of Fees from 1198 records it as Niweton. A Charter Roll from 1245 records it as Neuton Purcel. "Newton" is one of the commonest place-names in English. It is derived from the Old English nēowa tūn meaning "new homestead" or "new village". Manor The manor was created in the 12th century for the Purcel family, mainly with land from two neighbouring manors: Mixbury and Fringford. These manors had different overlords, and as a result the Purcels had feudal obligations
