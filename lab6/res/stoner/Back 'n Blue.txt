Back 'n Blue
"Back 'n Blue" is a song by the American rock band Cheap Trick, released in 1990 as the opening track on their eleventh studio album Busted. It was written by Taylor Rhodes, Robert A. Johnson, Rick Nielsen and Robin Zander, and produced by Richie Zito.Although not released as a single, "Back 'n Blue" gained enough airplay on reach No. 32 on the U.S. Billboard Mainstream Rock Chart. Critical reception In a review of Busted, Popdose.com commented: "When the needle touched down into the groove of the first track on side one, "Back 'n Blue", I was greeted with some moderately cool rock guitar riffage, some well placed na-na-na’s and a tough Robin Zander vocal. The title of the song continued CT's tradition of having fun with words (in this case, altering a cliché for their own purposes), but the song itself didn't reflect that fun. It plodded, and probably would have been better off in the hands of Bon Jovi."
