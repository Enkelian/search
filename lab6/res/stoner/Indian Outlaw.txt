Indian Outlaw
"Indian Outlaw" is a song written by Jumpin' Gene Simmons and John D. Loudermilk, and performed by American country music artist Tim McGraw. It was released in January 1994 as the first single from his album Not a Moment Too Soon. It was McGraw's breakthrough single, his first Top 40 country hit, and his fourth single overall. It peaked at number 8 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks charts, and number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100. Content The song is an up-tempo set in minor key, backed by tom-tom drums and fiddle. The narrator describes himself as a rebellious American Indian character, "Half Cherokee and Choctaw". He describes, among other things, his pursuit of a Chippewa lover. The song contains a sample of John D. Loudermilk's song "Indian Reservation", which is sung as shouting at the end ("Cherokee people, Cherokee tribe! / So proud to live, so proud to die"). A dance remix of the single was also made. This remix appears on McGraw's 2010 album Number One Hits. The song was considered controversial at the time, due to its stereotypical portrayal of Native Americans; as a result, some radio stations refused to play it. Critical reception
