Associated Independent Recording
Associated Independent Recording (AIR) is an independent recording company founded in London in 1965 by record producer Sir George Martin and his business partner John Burgess, after their departure from Parlophone. The first album produced by George Martin by his new company was the Beatles' Rubber Soul, recorded at Abbey Road Studios. The leading independent recording studio complex was founded in 1969. Since then AIR has operated its own professional audio recording facilities, AIR Studios. Oxford Street – London (1970–1991) AIR's first facility opened on 6 October 1970. It was located on the fourth floor of 214 Oxford Street, containing four studios and (later) a MIDI programming room. The facility included two large studios (one 58×32 feet, the other 30×28 feet) and two small ones. The studios contained two Bösendorfer pianos, many soundproof booths, and a 56-channel mixing console, custom-designed by Neve Electronics to AIR's specification. Many artists recorded there, including the Pretenders for their 1984 album Learning to Crawl. AIR Montserrat (mid-1970s–1989) The company built another recording studio on the Caribbean island of Montserrat in the late 1970s. The first album cut in the newly opened studios was Real to Reel by the Climax Blues Band in 1979. Jimmy
