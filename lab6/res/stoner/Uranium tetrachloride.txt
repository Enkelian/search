Uranium tetrachloride
Uranium tetrachloride (UCl4) is compound of uranium in oxidation state +4. It was used in the electromagnetic isotope separation (EMIS) process of uranium enrichment. It is one of the main starting materials for organouranium chemistry. Synthesis Uranium tetrachloride is synthesised generally by the reaction of uranium trioxide (UO3) and hexachloropropene. Solvent UCl4 adducts can be formed by a simpler reaction of UI4 with hydrogen chloride in organic solvents. Chemical properties Uranium tetrachloride is a hygroscopic, dark green solid, which sublimes in a high vacuum at ca. 500 °C. The crystal structure shows the uranium to be surrounded by eight chlorine atoms, four at 264 pm and the other four at 287pm. The molecule UCl4 is a Lewis acid and dissolves in solvents that can act as non-protic Lewis bases. Dissolution in protic solvents is more complicated. When UCl4 is added to water the uranium aqua ion is formed. UCl4 + xH2O → [U(H2O)x]4+ + 4Cl−The aqua ion [U(H2O)x]4+, (x is 8 or 9) is strongly hydrolyzed. [U(H2O)x]4+ ⇌ [U(H2O)x−1(OH)]3+ + H+The pKa for this reaction is ca. 1.6, so hydrolysis is absent only in solutions of acid strength 1 mol dm−3 or stronger (pH < 0). Further hydrolysis occurs at
