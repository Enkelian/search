Changes (Black Sabbath song)
"Changes" is a song by Black Sabbath. It first appeared on Vol. 4 which was released in 1972. Overview The song's piano melody was composed by guitarist Tony Iommi, who was experimenting with the instrument in the studio. The lyrics were by bassist Geezer Butler, and vocalist Ozzy Osbourne has referred to the song as "heartbreaking". Quite different from Sabbath's previous work, the song was described as a "forlornly pretty" ballad by critic Barney Hoskyns. It was inspired mainly by Bill Ward's breakup with his first wife."We're certainly not going to get any less heavy," Ozzy promised in 1972. "We will probably do 'Changes' on stage with a Mellotron but we'll never take strings on stage with us or anything like that."The song was performed live in 1973 but very seldom in years following. The song was covered by soul artist Charles Bradley on his 2016 album called "Changes". Bradleyâ€™s version has since been featured as the theme song of the Netflix animated series Big Mouth. That version also appeared in the first season of the HBO series "Big Little Lies", and is included on that soundtrack as well. "Changes" was ranked the 12th best Black Sabbath song by Rock
