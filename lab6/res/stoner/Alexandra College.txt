Alexandra College
Alexandra College is an independent day and boarding girls' school located in Milltown, Dublin, Ireland. The school operates under a Church of Ireland ethos. History The school was founded in 1866 and takes its name from Princess Alexandra of Denmark, the school's patron. The school colours, red and white, were adopted from the Danish flag in her honour.

The Royal University of Ireland Act 1879 allowed females to take university
