Have Love Will Travel
"Have Love, Will Travel" is a 1959 song written and recorded by Richard Berry. Berry also wrote and originally performed the classic hit "Louie Louie". The title is a based on a popular television/radio western serial Have Gun, Will Travel. The Sonics version In its best known incarnation, garage-rock protopunkers, The Sonics, covered the song on their 1965 album, Here Are The Sonics. Driven by haphazardly recorded fuzz guitar, a big driving drum sound, screaming vocals and a dirty saxophone break, it epitomized their sound at that time. The Sonics changed the chord progression from the original G-Am-Bb-Am, a 1-2m-m3-2m progression, to a basic 1-4-5-4 progression, which in G would be simply G-C-D-C. This is the version that virtually all other artists copied. Other versions The song was released by Paul Revere and the Raiders as a 1964 B-side. Other notable 60s cover versions include Woody Carr (1964), Gallahads (1964), Hollywood Hurricanes (UK, 1964), Imperialites (1964), Lee Maye (1964), Off-Beats (1964), and Sano and the Saints Five (1966).
