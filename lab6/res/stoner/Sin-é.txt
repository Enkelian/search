History Original café The original Sin-é, located at 122 St. Mark's Place in Manhattan's East Village, was a small café that served food, coffee, and Rolling Rock beer. It was opened by Irish immigrant Shane Doyle in 1989. The early days saw a number of poetry readings and acoustic sessions. One outfit that began to bring in the non-Irish East Village crowd on a Saturday night was known as The Clumsy Cabaret, a late-night gathering that drew musicians (including many of New York's anti-folk scene) after gigs. Acoustic music sessions took place in a spontaneous and creative atmosphere. Patrons included emerging writers, photographers, artists, designers and musicians. Later, as a more established venue, performers played for tips. Seasoned performers such as Sinéad O'Connor, Jeff Buckley, October Project, Marianne Faithfull, Shane MacGowan, Hothouse Flowers, The Waterboys, Allen Ginsberg, Star Drooker, and the band Native Tongue also appeared at Sin-é, giving impromptu performances. The stage was an area where tables were cleared away against a wall.The informal atmosphere and devoted regular audience were instrumental
