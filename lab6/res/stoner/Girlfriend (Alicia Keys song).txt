Girlfriend (Alicia Keys song)
"Girlfriend" is a song by American singer-songwriter Alicia Keys. It was written by Keys, Jermaine Dupri, and Joshua Thompson for her debut album, Songs in A Minor (2001), while production was helmed by Durpi and Keys. The song is built around an interpolation from Ol' Dirty Bastard's 1995 song "Brooklyn Zoo". Due to the inclusion of the sample, Robert Diggs and Russell Jones are also credited as songwriters. The track released as the album's fourth and final single outside the United States, where it charted at number eighty-two on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart due to moderate airplay. Although "Girlfriend" managed to outpeak previous single "How Come You Don't Call Me" in the United Kingdom and Australia, it failed to make impact elsewhere. The song's KrucialKeys Sista Girl Mix, which appears on the re-release Songs in A Minor: Remixed & Unplugged, is used in the video, directed by Patrick Hoelck, and was serviced to radio instead of its album version.
