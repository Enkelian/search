Xenon monochloride
Xenon monochloride (XeCl) is an excimer which is used in excimer lasers emitting near ultraviolet light at 308 nm. It is most commonly used in medicine. It was used to produce a body image from the Shroud of Turin. The results suggest that a directional burst of ultraviolet radiation may have played a role in the formation of the image on the Shroud.Xenon monochloride was first synthesized in the 1960s. Its kinetic scheme is very complex and its state changes occur on a nanosecond timescale. In the gaseous state, at least two kinds of xenon monochloride are known: XeCl and Xe2Cl, whereas complex aggregates form in the solid state in noble gas matrices. The excited state of xenon resembles halogens and it reacts with them to form excited molecular compounds. Introduction Molecules that are only stable in electronically excited states are called excimer molecules, but may be called exciplex molecules if they are heteronuclear. The exciplex halides constitute an important class of rare gas halides with formula RgX. Rg is the noble gas, and X is the halogen. These molecules are de-excited by emitting a photon whose energy is some Electronvolts. Therefore, the wavelength of the light produced is in
