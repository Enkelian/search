Interchange (road)
In the field of road transport, an interchange is a road junction that uses grade separation, and typically one or more ramps, to permit traffic on at least one highway to pass through the junction without interruption from other crossing traffic streams. It differs from a standard intersection, where roads cross at grade. Interchanges are almost always used when at least one road is a controlled-access highway (freeway or motorway) or a limited-access divided highway (expressway), though they are sometimes used at junctions between surface streets. Terminology Note: The descriptions of interchanges apply to countries where vehicles drive on the right side of the road. For left-side driving, layout of the junctions is the same, only left/right is reversed. A freeway junction or highway interchange (US) or motorway junction (UK) is a type of road junction linking one controlled-access highway (freeway or motorway) to another, to other roads, or to a rest area or motorway service area. In the UK, most (but not all) junctions are numbered sequentially. In the US, interchanges are either numbered by mileage (in most states) or by interchange number.
